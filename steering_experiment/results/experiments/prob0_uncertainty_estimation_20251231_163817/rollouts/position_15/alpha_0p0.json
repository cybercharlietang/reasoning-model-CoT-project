    "text": " But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are multiplied by different variables. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, every term from the first expression gets multiplied by every term from the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term in the first part doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second expression, it will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the second expression contributes a factor of 1, because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in the product, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the terms where the second expression contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), then unless \\(k = 0\\), it won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the constant term in the second expression. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 (from earlier) multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the constant term in the second part, because any other term in the second part would introduce some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because then the coefficient would depend on all the terms in the second expansion, which isn't the case. No, actually, no, because in the product, each term is a product of terms from each part. So, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me check if I'm considering all possibilities correctly. Suppose I expand both expressions and multiply them. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term where the second part is 1 would result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have additional factors of \\(c^k\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

    "text": " But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, because when I multiply the two expressions together, I might have terms that combine, but the problem is specifically about \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part separately and then see how it interacts with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I can just consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but that would give me a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by, say, \\(c^6\\) from the second part, I get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps only the constant term in the second expression will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Because if I have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the only contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For this to be a constant term, the exponent must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term 20 from the second part, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but earlier I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, does that mean the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120? Let me verify that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. So, when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if there was a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20, but any other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the product have \\(c\\) terms, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, only the constant term from the second expression affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, that might not be correct because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a product of two expressions, and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems like it would give me a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. That doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would be part of the expansion, and the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. I'm confused. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering all terms in the expansion where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and we need to find the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering that the expression is a product. So, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's essentially 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms is multiplied by the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, when you multiply 6 by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively distributing the 6 across all those terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only one specific term in the product. Wait, no, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since it's not specified, I think it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 384. Let me verify this another way. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I consider that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, when you distribute, you get 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are multiplied in such a way that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but that seems unlikely because every term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense because then it's a specific term. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when multiplied together, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the overall coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We seek the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that part might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when you multiply, the \\(c\\) terms will affect the \\(c\\) exponents, but not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is. But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but if we're looking for the coefficient of a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the other terms involving \\(c\\) would just contribute a coefficient, but not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, you get a product where each term is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, and then by the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a monomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, when you expand it, what is the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, that term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because it's not a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part is independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is just multiplied along. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a monomial, so when you multiply by 6, each of those monomials becomes part of the coefficient. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because it's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would involve the second part as well. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. When you have two independent variables, like \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their coefficients in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part would have a coefficient, say, \\(C\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(C\\), where \\(C\\) is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, maybe that's the approach. Let me try that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think the answer is 120. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that might make more sense. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because coefficients are typically constants, not expressions in other variables. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, but that's not possible because the coefficient itself is a function of \\(c\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to re-express the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms from the second expansion. Wait, let me try to think differently. Let me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems very complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is expecting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would be the term \\(120\\), because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean the entire expression I wrote earlier. But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's expecting the entire coefficient, which is a function of \\(c\\). But that seems unusual because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions in other variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all variables together, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\\). So, that would be the coefficient. But I'm not sure if that's what is being asked. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning the constant term, so 20, and then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, maybe the answer is 120. Let me check that approach again. If I consider the entire product, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part.

But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the entire expression involving \\(c\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all variables, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), but that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that this is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times that expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the expression as I wrote before. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me see if that makes sense. So, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be the term where from \\((a + b)^4\\) we take \\(a^2b^2\\) and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) we take the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times that. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering the entire product, and perhaps it's expecting the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me verify that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

So, does that mean that the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just a constant multiplier for the term \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to consider whether the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part contributes anything. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, I need to see if there's any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because that would be the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term that's still \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, let me check if \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term. If it does, then that term's coefficient will multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that would be 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so their product is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because those would affect the exponents of \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, when I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\), but no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and not worrying about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the coefficients from the second expression and summing them up, multiplied by 6. Wait, that might be it. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then when you multiply by the entire second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times anything would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the variables in the second polynomial are only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients of each term in the second part are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2k\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's indeed the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe it's expecting the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or maybe it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c\\) is zero, which is not possible because \\(c\\) is in the denominator. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so 120.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term in the expansion would have a part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and a part with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in each term when multiplied by the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term from the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm my earlier thought.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute the entire expansion. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. When I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and when you multiply by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interfere in different ways, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, I think this approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the expansion more directly. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found before. Then, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but to double-check, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nHmm, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions. Alternatively, perhaps considering that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

That suggests that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't depend on \\(c\\), so maybe the second part can be considered separately. Wait, actually, when I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expression only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that might not be the case. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that we're looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the rest of the variables are whatever they are. But wait, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually involve the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we need to consider that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would vary depending on \\(k\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), meaning that we just take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, and I don't think that's the case because the problem includes the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That seems plausible. So, let me try that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the corresponding terms from each expansion. That is, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) has coefficient 120. But wait, is that the only term? Or does the problem consider \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then 120 is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would vary depending on the exponent of \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is specifically asking for the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I think that's the correct interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me check again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) times \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That makes sense. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about it another way. If I were to expand the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) in the second part, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if I want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, that's when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the combined coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.

    "text": " But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and when I multiply it by the entire second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I can treat the second part as 1 in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second part evaluated at whatever term it is. But wait, no, actually, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and when you multiply by the entire second part, each term in the second part will have its own coefficient, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient 6 times 64? That would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) vary. But when we multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes 6 times each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second part will have a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a numerical value, not a polynomial, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or do I need to consider them? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, so actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only considering the terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it means that the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their coefficients don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables together. But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That would make more sense because then it's a single term. So, let me try that approach. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems more plausible. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That makes sense because when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) in the second. So, let's proceed with that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients we found, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the problem was just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), but now I'm considering \\(c^0\\). Maybe the problem is indeed asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not clear. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) term makes me think that the problem is more involved. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the polynomial, so perhaps it's just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120, as I found earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me verify that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying them together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

That makes me think that maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms from each expression. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that would affect the coefficient is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something from the second part, you need that something to not have any \\(c\\) terms so that the product remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other expression. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (the constant term), which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) term, and that would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we're looking for.

But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I need to interpret the problem differently.

Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was correct initially, but now I'm confused because if I don't specify the \\(c\\) term, then the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's implied that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120. Let me confirm this by considering another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will contribute to various terms in the product. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. Wait, but that would give us 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for because it's specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of all coefficients. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I found earlier. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just recap: In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens at \\(k = 3\\).

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then like terms are combined. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms in the product will have factors of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. When you multiply these together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is exactly what we're looking for. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but as written, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward.

The second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but none involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me clarify. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6, as calculated from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant for the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so each term in the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by their respective \\(c^k\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems correct. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me consider that when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), then when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me check that logic again. When you multiply two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Let me confirm by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a bad example. Let me take another example where \\(a^2b^2\\) exists. Wait, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the highest degree is 2, and you can't have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term unless the exponent is at least 4. So, maybe a better example is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\((c + 1)\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and by 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * (1 + 1) = 12, because the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1)\\) is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 2 = 12. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.

    "text": " But wait, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I think the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part might affect other terms but not \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part is a separate expression, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then when I multiply it by any term from the second part, say \\(c^k\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term involving \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression, you're effectively multiplying it by the sum of all the terms in the second expression, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial? I think you can find that by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), because substituting 1 for all variables gives you the sum of the coefficients. Let me check that. If I have a polynomial \\(P(c)\\), then \\(P(1)\\) is the sum of its coefficients. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64. Let me compute that: 6 * 60 is 360, and 6 * 4 is 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and I multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the terms in the second part are constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of the coefficients of the second expression, which is 64, as we found. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the reasoning. Another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, you're just adding the same coefficient multiple times. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. I think that makes sense. So, yeah, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied, but \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term as it is, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just add a factor to the coefficient, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression is multiplied by it, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as before, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if I have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), then the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = c^0 = 1\\). So, perhaps only the term where the exponents cancel out contributes to the constant term, which would then multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 120. That makes more sense. So, I think my initial approach was wrong because I considered all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is what would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents cancel is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Then, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, the overall expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\), when I multiply them, the coefficients multiply as well.

Wait, why the constant term? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something, to get just \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part should be \\(c^0\\), which is 1.

Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some term involving \\(c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6. Okay, so let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).
