So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the other expansion. But is that the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or could there be other terms that, when multiplied together, result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? Let me think. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives terms with \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the entire product term have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want because we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, my initial reasoning seems correct. The coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).
