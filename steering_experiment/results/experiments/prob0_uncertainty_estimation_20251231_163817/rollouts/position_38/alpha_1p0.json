    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20 because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\) because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. Any other term in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which we don't want. So, yes, I think I was correct in taking the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first binomial by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second binomial. The coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, it's 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but let me double-check that. When \\(m = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply each other in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, the coefficient is 6 * 20, which is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? For example, suppose I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\), but when multiplied by a term from the other polynomial, it could somehow give \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because the other polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, and when multiplied by a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that would mean the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me just think again: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me write out the expansion a bit more explicitly. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) would multiply each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(4a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term would multiply each term in the second polynomial, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(24a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term \\(20\\), resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, that confirms that the coefficient is indeed 120. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.

For example, could there be a term from the second polynomial that, when multiplied by a term from the first polynomial, results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)?

Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that also doesn't have \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term in the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that seems correct. Let me try another approach to confirm. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. I think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I'm not missing anything else. Sometimes, when you have products of polynomials, there can be cross terms that might contribute to the same monomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second polynomial. There's no other way because any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would change the monomial. So, I don't think there are any other contributions to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's thorough.

So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we only take the product of the coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply them, the term is 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120\\(a^2b^2\\). So yes, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would actually be the sum over all terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we just take the product of the coefficients, because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which isn't what we want. Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the term where \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6a^2b^2, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2.
