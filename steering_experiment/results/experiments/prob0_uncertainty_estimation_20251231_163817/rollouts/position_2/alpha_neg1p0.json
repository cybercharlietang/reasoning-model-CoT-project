    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That makes me think that maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So perhaps I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms just contribute a factor that we can consider separately. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product of both expansions. So perhaps I need to consider the product as a whole, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, maybe the coefficients from the second part will just multiply the coefficients from the first part. Let me think again.\n\nSo, first, let me expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the product is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this as well using the binomial theorem. The expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion will have a power of \\(c\\) given by \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the product will be:\n\n\\[\n(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\right)\n\\]\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can focus on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. When we multiply this term by each term in the second expansion, we'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). However, since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), I think we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a monomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But actually, no, that's not correct because the second polynomial is being multiplied term by term. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials: P(a,b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a,b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) multiplied by Q(c), which is the same as the coefficient in P(a,b) times the entire Q(c). But since Q(c) is a polynomial in c, it's a sum of terms, each with a coefficient. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by Q(c), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in Q(c), each with their respective coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in each of these products, each time multiplied by a term from Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier by setting c=1. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting c=1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I had before.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Similarly, the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the parts that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about this. \n\nFirst, let's consider the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The binomial expansion of this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\). So, does this mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, actually, when we multiply the two expressions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from each part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to consider the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two binomial expansions. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when we multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But wait, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Let me clarify. When we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), we get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). When we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose we have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). When we multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, this term will be multiplied by every term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q.\n\nWait, but in our case, Q is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in Q is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into Q gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in Q is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 64. \n\nWe already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, multiplying that by 64 gives 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the corresponding terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), any term involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since we're summing over all possible terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. That is, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for any term is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, as we found earlier. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case, like \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, which is 1 (for \\(c\\)) and 1 (for \\(1/c\\)), so 1*1 + 1*1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 (from \\(2ab\\)) times each coefficient in the second expansion, so 2*1 + 2*1 = 4. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*1 + 1*1 = 2. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first expansion (1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion (1 + 1 = 2). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2 * 2. So, this seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4 choose 2 is (4*3)/(2*1) = 6. And \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 is 384. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial expansion. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part affecting this term? Let me think.\n\nAlright, so starting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is given by:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and when we multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the multiplication by the second expression will just scale the coefficient by the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second binomial. But wait, that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6, but 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), but we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the result is terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the original question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, unless there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), \\(a^2b^2\\) would only have a coefficient if there's a \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. Because otherwise, all the terms would have some power of \\(c\\), making them different from \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me check if the second expansion has a constant term. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the first expansion by the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first will be multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times 6, which is 120.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. The coefficient in the first part is 6, and the coefficient in the second part for the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second polynomial isn't just a constant. Each term in the second polynomial is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms with \\(c\\) in them. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as a standalone term is if you multiply it by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you need to multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P and Q. P = (a + b)^4, Q = (c + 1/c)^6. The product P*Q will have terms like (term from P) * (term from Q). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where k is the exponent from Q. However, the only term in Q that doesn't involve c is the constant term, which is 20. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get 20a^2b^2, which is the only term in the product that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I guess I need to look at the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Then, maybe that term will multiply something from the other expansion, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, let me think.\n\nSo, first, let me expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\binom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\binom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nLooking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the third term, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will only come from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Because any other terms in the first expansion would involve higher or lower powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and we only want \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part's expansion. However, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different. So, when you multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just get multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that only the term in the first expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the second expansion. Because if I take any other term from the first expansion, like \\(a^3b\\) or \\(ab^3\\), when I multiply them by terms from the second expansion, they will result in terms that have higher or lower powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will be multiplied by each of those, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will give a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various terms involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when we expand the product, each term will have some power of \\(a\\), some power of \\(b\\), and some power of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients of terms where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. So, in other words, it's the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients is indeed 2^6 = 64, because each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\), and their sum is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the variables are different, so the coefficients would just be multiplied. But in this case, since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the answer would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me try to think of it another way. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) term is \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by calculating the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of these coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to consider if the problem is asking for a specific term, but in this case, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's the sum across all \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the expression is a product of two binomials. When you expand it, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all those products, which is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Recognize that this term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n3. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n4. Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Because when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc., which are \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is only possible if the power of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the second factor contributes \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, I need to compute two things: first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and second, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nStarting with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). I know that the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, we get \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient in the sense that it's a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else, but since the other terms are in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too complicated. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6, and the rest would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems too simplistic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, but since the second part is separate, the coefficient would remain 6. But I'm not sure. Let me try to check.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), right? But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean we need to find the constant term in the second expansion, because only then would the product \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant term result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. \n\nAh, that makes sense! So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me recall how to find the constant term in such an expansion. The binomial expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). In this case, \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = 1/c\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the part of the second expansion that's a constant, because any other term involving \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, yeah, the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nSo, maybe I can separate the two parts. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, perhaps the second part doesn't affect it? Or does it? Wait, actually, no. The entire expression is the product of the two expansions, so when we multiply them together, the terms from each expansion will combine. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, unless we're only considering terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms cancel out, which would be the constant term, perhaps? Or maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it's a bit ambiguous, but I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be the case because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\) as well. But that seems unlikely because usually, when asking for a coefficient, they specify if they want it treating other variables as constants. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the entire term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the coefficient we're looking for. \n\nSo, let me proceed with that assumption. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. \n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two expansions, we multiply the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it just acts as a constant multiplier for the terms in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

Since \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are involved, but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand this part at all because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply the two expansions together, every term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I might need to consider how the terms combine. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when I multiply it by any term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to sum up all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by each term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the resulting terms would have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and then multiply by 6. \n\nWait, but that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each term in the second expansion contributes to a different term in the final product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because I'm not sure if I'm supposed to consider all the terms or just the constant term. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both expressions and then look for the term where the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and any power of \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake by considering the entire sum. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as I thought before. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2 (since when c=1, it's 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nBut if I expand it fully, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\), which when considering coefficients, if we set c=1, it's 2, so the coefficient is 2. \n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the second expansion is a separate factor, and when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the example I did earlier, it worked out. Let me try another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when c=1 is 2, so the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (the coefficient from the first expansion) times 2 (the sum of coefficients from the second expansion). So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because in the problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, so each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), making each term in the product have \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in the example, when I had \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a coefficient. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's a bit more complicated. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a generating function. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients, which is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I think I'm confusing coefficients with terms. Let me try to clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, yes, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that combine to form that specific term. \n\nIn this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term can be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I'm not sure if I'm supposed to consider each term separately or just sum the coefficients. Let me think differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand both expressions and then look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient}\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the sum is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, yes, the sum is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have two expressions, P and Q. P is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product P * Q will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\). \n\nSo, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find all terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2, power of \\(b\\) is 2, and power of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nWait, but that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in Q, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in Q is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in reality, when you multiply P and Q, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut in that case, how can \\(a^2b^2\\) exist without any \\(c\\) terms? It's only possible if we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) is a variable, each term will have a different power. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, which is 64. \n\nWait, but in reality, each term in Q is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^{\\text{something}}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient from P times the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). \n\nMultiplying these, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a coefficient. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) becomes 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 (from P) times 2 (sum of coefficients in Q), so 2. \n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but in the example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the product becomes \\((a + b)^2 \\times 2 = 2a^2 + 4ab + 2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which matches 1 (from P) times 2 (sum of coefficients in Q). \n\nTherefore, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is then considered, and the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So maybe I can treat them separately. \n\nLet me write down the binomial theorem for the first part. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I know that when I expand this, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means I don't need to consider the expansion of the second part because the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Is there a possibility that when multiplying the two expansions, the \\(c\\) terms could somehow affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, no, because each part is independent. The first part is purely in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is purely in terms of \\(c\\). So when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I can just take the coefficient from the first expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, that's a good point. The second part might have a term where \\(c^0\\), which is just a constant. So, maybe I should check if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that.\n\nFor the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) gives 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the expansion of the first part, and the \\(c^0\\) term comes from the second part. So, the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which means the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match what I'm looking for.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each binomial separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the term where \\(c^0\\). This occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3.

Since these two expansions are multiplied together, I think I need to consider the terms from each expansion and see how they combine to give me the term with \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So maybe I don't need to worry about the second expansion affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, let me think. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that first. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, does that mean I need to consider all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expansion? Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by terms from the second expansion, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. But the terms from the second expansion only affect the \\(c\\) part, not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right either because the second part isn't just a single term; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each product will have a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, does that mean I'm supposed to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion? \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present as a factor in each of these terms, but each of these terms has additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficients from the second part are attached to different powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're considering the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the combined expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is just a scalar multiple. But that can't be because the second part is a binomial expansion, which is a sum of terms, not a single term. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the second part in the problem makes me think that's not the case. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, let me think about that. The sum of all coefficients in the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 \\times 64 = 384. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's just 6. But given that the problem includes the second part, I think the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about it another way. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term in the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those contributions. \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Suppose I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), we would have needed to compute the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the specific coefficient from the second part for \\(c^k\\). But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all the coefficients from the second part. \n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my calculations. \n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. \n\nSecond, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), that's correct. \n\nSo, multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding 64. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):**\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n3. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - Set \\(c = 1\\): \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

That term is specifically from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables c and 1/c, so when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the corresponding terms in each expansion. \n\nLet me break this down. First, let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Similarly, using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term's exponent of c is \\(6 - 2m\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve c at all, right? So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because we don't want any c terms in the final product.\n\nSo, in the second expansion, we need the term where the exponent of c is 0. Let's set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for m:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where m = 3 in the second expansion will give us \\(c^0\\), which is 1. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the total coefficient for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion):\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first expansion gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion gives me 20 for the term with \\(c^0\\). When I multiply them, I get 120. That seems right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing that to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we only care about the term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. The other terms in the second expansion would introduce c terms, which we don't want in the final product.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying each term, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the term with \\(c^0\\), we solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So maybe I can treat each part separately and then multiply the coefficients?\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). The binomial theorem tells me that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, looking at the other part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, this will be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWait, so each term in this expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). That means the exponents of \\(c\\) will be even numbers decreasing from 6 to -6 as \\(m\\) increases from 0 to 6. But since the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the expansion of this part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, hold on. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when I multiply these two together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), multiplying by any term from the second polynomial won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems confusing because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it would result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a constant. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. Let me check the original problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, it doesn't mention \\(c\\), so maybe it's just considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, and when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they just want the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not standard. Usually, coefficients are constants with respect to all variables. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, treating all variables together. So, for example, if we have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that's not standard because in polynomial terms, each term has specific exponents for all variables. So perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider that the other part doesn't affect it. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's consider that when you expand the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, a number. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable and considering all possible terms, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\). But that would give \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify that, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless we consider specific terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify that, so maybe it's just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nWait, but that seems odd because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from one is multiplied by each term from the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that's a polynomial, not a single number. So perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify that, so maybe it's just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. \n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's break it down. \n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because we want \\(c^0\\) in the product. \n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem was actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it was written as just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), or the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the binomial expansions. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent is 0, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The other part involving \\(c\\) might not affect this term because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Let me check that thought.\n\nFirst, let me recall the binomial theorem. It states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

I think I'm confusing something here.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number.\n\nLet me check that. If we consider the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we can find its coefficient by taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and multiplying them together.\n\nSo, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is formed by multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\) in steps of 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be this polynomial. However, that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nBut wait, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, so their expansion doesn't affect the \\(c\\) terms. So maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure how this relates to \\(a^2b^2\\), but maybe since the two expressions are multiplied together, the entire coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So perhaps the second part can be evaluated separately, and since it's raised to the 6th power, maybe it's a constant when considering the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6; it's 6 times something else. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expansions. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the other part is separate. But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering how the terms from both expansions interact. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, that can't be right because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by a constant. But that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in that expansion and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which gives:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which meant I needed to consider the constant term in the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20, and multiplying that by 6 gives 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expansion. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when finding this coefficient. Let me think.\n\nAlright, so the overall expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms from the second expansion will just multiply the entire first expansion. But when we multiply two expansions, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, regardless of the second part? Hmm, that might not be correct because the entire expression is multiplied together. Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) just contributes a factor that's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term from the first expansion, I think we can treat the second expansion as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so perhaps the coefficient is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, then in the product, it will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. Let me check that.\n\nYes, when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 64. Okay, that makes sense now.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, as I thought earlier, this 6 is then multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 equals 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) really 64? Because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first expansion, the terms from the second expansion don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, I think it's the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But when we collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another approach: maybe I should expand both expressions separately and then multiply the terms. But that seems more complicated because the second expression has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would affect the overall expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^k for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the product. However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, then the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients should be multiplied. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficients add up when the variables match. But in this case, the variables in the second polynomial are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to see it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the entire first expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " Similarly, the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when I expand both parts, I'll have terms from each expansion multiplied together. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nI need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. So, let's find \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Similarly, using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWait, so each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe I need to consider the constant term in this expansion. Because when I multiply the two expansions together, the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is if the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, I need to find the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant.\n\nLet me solve for \\(m\\):\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is \\(20\\).\n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term \\(20\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I need to consider any other terms because any other terms from the second expansion would involve powers of \\(c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nThus, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both expansions, we get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The binomial theorem tells us that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Specifically, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be when \\(k = 2\\), because then \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expression we're dealing with is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So when I multiply this by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Hmm, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it's not correct because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will contribute a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that seems odd because \\(c\\) is separate. Wait, no, when you expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial gives the total coefficient for that term in the product. For example, if you have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Similarly, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this logic. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1) = ac + a + bc + b\\), and the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(a \\times 1\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a \\times c\\)), but wait, that's not correct because in the expansion, the terms are \\(ac\\), \\(a\\), \\(bc\\), and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(a\\)) plus 1 (from \\(ac\\)), but \\(ac\\) is a different term. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is only the coefficient from the \\(a\\) term, which is 1, because \\(ac\\) is a separate term involving \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is just 1, not 2. Hmm, so my earlier logic was wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, not 2. So, my initial approach was incorrect. Therefore, I need to rethink this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm considering the multiplication. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is only multiplied by the terms in the other polynomial that don't involve the variables of the first term. Wait, but in reality, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, regardless of variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the simpler example, that approach gave the wrong result. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Let's take \\((a + b)(c + 1)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, from the term \\(a\\). The term \\(ac\\) is a separate term involving \\(c\\), so it's not part of the \\(a\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is just 1, not 2. So, my initial approach was wrong because I thought the coefficient would be multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, but that's not the case. Instead, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that can't be right because the second polynomial is being multiplied, so the entire expression is a product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you expand the entire product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut earlier, in the simple example, this approach didn't work. So, perhaps I'm confusing the way coefficients work when variables are involved. Let me try another approach. Let's denote the first polynomial as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, when we write out the product, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) has coefficient 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 1 (from \\(c^6\\) term in \\(Q(c)\\)). Similarly, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) has coefficient 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous because it doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we're to sum the coefficients. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\). So, let's explore that possibility.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But in the earlier simple example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 1, not 2, even though the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial was 2. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but without considering \\(c\\). That is, perhaps it's treating \\(c\\) as a constant, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges over the exponents from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by every possible \\(c^m\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThe sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that approach was wrong because in the simple example, it didn't work. Let me check that again. Let's take \\((a + b)(c + 1)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, from the term \\(a\\), and the term \\(ac\\) is a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, not 2. Therefore, the approach of multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems contradictory because the second part is being multiplied, so it should affect the overall coefficients. Wait, but in reality, when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first polynomial is scaled by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each coefficient in the second part, but since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial, regardless of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut in the simple example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 1, not 2, even though the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial was 2. So, perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the simple example, the second polynomial was \\((c + 1)\\), which has two terms, but when multiplied by \\(a\\), it creates two terms: \\(ac\\) and \\(a\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1, and the coefficient of \\(ac\\) is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not multiplied by the sum of coefficients, but rather, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and the coefficients add up only if the variables are the same. But in our original problem, the variables are different: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms is a separate term in the product, with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, 6, because the second polynomial's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, that seems more plausible. Because the variables are separate, multiplying by the second polynomial doesn't change the coefficients of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. It just appends different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in the first polynomial, which is 6.\n\nBut then, why does the second polynomial exist? It seems like it's just modifying the \\(c\\) terms, but not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, regardless of the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply by a polynomial, you're scaling the coefficients. For example, if you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 2 = 12. So, in that case, the coefficient is scaled by the constant factor. So, perhaps in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is scaled by the entire second polynomial, but since the second polynomial is not a constant, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient becomes a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not what the problem is asking. The problem is just asking for the coefficient, implying a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThat seems plausible. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\).\n\nNow, we also want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that they intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, after all this thinking and checking, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from both binomial expansions. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So maybe I can focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) first and then consider how the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might affect the coefficient. Or perhaps the \\(c\\) terms just multiply the entire expansion, so maybe I don't need to worry about them when looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nLet me think. The entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should consider that the \\(c\\) part is separate, so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, which isn't possible because we're looking for a term without \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, when I expand the entire product, each term will be of the form (term from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by (term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term from the first part, I need to find all the terms in the second part that don't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when expanded will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). So, the only way for a term in the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if the term from the second expansion is \\(c^0\\), which is 1, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but we only care about the term where the second part is \\(c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is indeed 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we solve \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients found in the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That seems a bit tricky because the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Maybe I can treat each part separately and then multiply them together, but I need to find where \\(a^2b^2\\) comes into play.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. So, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how the terms from each expansion interact when multiplied together. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way the product will have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by some term from the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so any term from it will be a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by a term from the second expansion, we'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Or am I missing something here?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're considering the entire product, and we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). If that's the case, then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, for example, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{k-1}\\), etc., depending on the term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll always have some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, we're looking for all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and we sum their coefficients, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're considering the product as a polynomial in three variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(c^0\\) remains, so \\(k = 0\\). That would make sense because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would require that in the second expansion, we take the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. So, let me think about that. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion has a coefficient of 20. When we multiply these two terms together, the resulting term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that maybe the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, but that seems incorrect because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning. The first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When multiplied, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient 6 from the first part. From the second part, to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

But \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients if the variables are separate. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial where the variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of all coefficients. Let me compute that.\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me verify this. If I consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term that only involves the variables from the first polynomial is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients of the second expansion).\n\nTherefore, I think my approach is correct. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. The expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When \\(c = 1\\), it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the sum of the coefficients being equal to the evaluation at \\(c = 1\\), which is 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient should just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when I multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\), etc. So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, I get terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 36a^2b^2c^4, 90a^2b^2c^2, 120a^2b^2, etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. So that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), they would all have different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's in the product of two expressions, the coefficient is simply the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's entire expansion contributes a factor of 64 when considering all terms. So, 6*64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. The expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64.\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I think I'm confident that 384 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
