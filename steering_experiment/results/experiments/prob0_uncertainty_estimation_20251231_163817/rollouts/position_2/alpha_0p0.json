    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\). So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when looking for this specific term? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would come from multiplying the corresponding terms from each expansion. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply everything together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be correct either because each term in the second expansion would have a coefficient, and when you multiply by the term from the first expansion, it would affect the overall coefficient. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try to break it down more carefully. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient, and since we want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't affected by \\(c\\), it's just the product of the two coefficients.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(k=2\\) would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), right? So the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being the product of the two coefficients because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(c\\) just contribute their coefficients when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k=2\\) in the first expansion, so the coefficient there is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) in the second expansion, the term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\). That is, \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so again, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe only certain terms would contribute, but no, since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that's correct. So, the final coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - Substitute \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum: \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that. So, using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me see what value of \\(k\\) gives me that.\n\nSo, \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) should be \\(a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables in the first part, while \\(c\\) is a variable in the second part. Since they are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the second part. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, I have the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, I have a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't change the term.\n\nSo, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire second expansion, which includes a constant term 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought before.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there a possibility that when I multiply, other terms might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could terms from the second expansion with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), except when the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant. So, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, my calculation of 120 should be correct.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), find the constant term, which is 20. Multiply them together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, only the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). If I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, my earlier reasoning holds.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, collect like terms, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the other part. That makes sense because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every possible term from the other expansion, so the coefficient would accumulate all those products.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(k=2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\).

So, does that mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, regardless of the second part? \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of both parts. So, actually, any term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\) because the exponent on \\(c\\) in the second part is 6.

So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just multiplied by 1? \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only present in the first part, so when I multiply it by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, does that mean that the coefficient is the same as in the first part? \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would be the term where \\(c^m \\times c^{-n}\\) equals \\(c^0\\), meaning \\(m = n\\). Since the exponent in the second part is 6, the only way to get \\(c^0\\) is to have \\(m = 3\\) and \\(n = 3\\), because \\(m + n = 6\\) and \\(m - n = 0\\) implies \\(m = n = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^3 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3\\) in the second part. \n\nLet me compute each part separately. \n\nFirst, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. \n\nNext, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, it's 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get the term without any \\(c\\) terms, you need to multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nYes, I think that's right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the relevant coefficients from each binomial expansion. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Let me think.\n\nAlright, so the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will combine. But the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means the part of the expression involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Or does it? Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as just its sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the constant term in the second expression won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. If there were other terms, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), multiplying by those would change the variables, but since we only care about \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., the constant term.\n\nSo, to clarify, I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. The constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\), so here, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, hold on, that seems off because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) which is 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're multiplying the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, but only the constant term (20) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expression involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term contributes, so 6 * 20 = 120 is indeed the coefficient.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

Because when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. So, perhaps I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, that might not make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will only come from the first part, right? Because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the entire second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless the problem is asking for the coefficient in a specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, actually, when you expand \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\( \\binom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\), but actually, wait, the exponents on \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - m\\) and \\(-m\\), so combined, it's \\(6 - 2m\\). Hmm, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is not just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part, but that can't be because the second part is multiplied, not added. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is a monomial, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, the coefficients add up. But that might not be correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a Laurent polynomial, not a single number. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, maybe the problem is indeed considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a Laurent polynomial. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and then considering the other part separately, but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nAlright, so let's proceed with that understanding. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I'll find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the same as the constant term. To find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a Laurent polynomial, which doesn't make much sense in this context. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. That makes sense.\n\nSo, I think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Oh, wait, maybe I misread the problem. It says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, I might be looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second part.

Actually, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. But let me check this again.\n\nWait, another approach: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes all its terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure because the problem might be interpreted differently. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the answer is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, without considering the other part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes the entire product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 (c + d)^6\\), but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which as I calculated earlier is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), then in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, but as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the terms are \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is indeed 2, which is 1 * 2. So, that seems to confirm the approach.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is \\(2^2 = 4\\), so the coefficient would be 4. Let's check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 4, which matches. So, the approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think once more. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\)? But no, the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term will have some power of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we'd have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) term, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is written correctly, and I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6, and the rest is a separate factor. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of both expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me try to write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\right) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second expansion:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. If I set \\(c = 1\\), the second expansion becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so in the product, it's 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all\u2014it only has \\(c\\) terms. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is of the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But wait, actually, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), every term in it will just multiply the corresponding term in the first part.\n\nBut actually, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is a product, so each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would be multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by a term from the second part, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the combined term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, I need the term in the second part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(c^0\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nLet me confirm that. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nCalculating that, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms, and I correctly found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, looking at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I correctly identified that the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and that term is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. Since the second expansion's constant term is 20, and the first part's coefficient is 6, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any errors in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^{2}b^{2}\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).

So maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think about that.\n\nAlright, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) first because that's where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will give terms involving \\(c\\) raised to some power, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will get multiplied by every term from the second part, each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient factor without affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Let me clarify. The entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will just add a factor involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term will contribute to the overall coefficient, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the product of 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right either. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i} b^i \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j} \\).\n\nSo when you multiply these together, each term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i} b^i \\times \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j} \\). Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all terms where \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), which as before, gives us \\(i = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, for each such term, we also have the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) from the second polynomial. But wait, no, because when we multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, you're just scaling the entire expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from the first and second polynomials where the variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), the variables in the second polynomial don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second part), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the terms in the second polynomial are just constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier. So then, 6 * 64 = 384. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term in the expansion of the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is 1. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2? Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply out, each term is separate. Wait, no, actually, when you expand, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), but the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So perhaps my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i} b^i \\times \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). So when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we set \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), which gives us \\(i = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, for each \\(j\\) from 0 to 6, the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, the coefficient will be the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) multiplied by 6. So that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) for \\(j = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) from \\(j = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense now. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Let me double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the entire second polynomial, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but when you're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, no. When you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expansion and see. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So the sum of the coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). So when I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. But since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing the concept. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply the coefficients together. Let me break it down.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\). The term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4 choose 2, which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait a second, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and any term from the second expansion. But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial that combine to form that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be present if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, I was wrong earlier; the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the expansion I had earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly:\n\n6! = 720\n\n3! = 6\n\nSo, 6! / (3! * 3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\n6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Let me think.\n\nAlright, so the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, when I expand them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, maybe I can handle them separately.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, let's find the coefficient for that.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Since \\(n = 4\\), \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this interacts with the first part. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and this term doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the second part can be considered separately. Wait, no, because when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have \\(c\\), the coefficient from the second expansion must be the constant term.\n\nSo, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part.

So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 as the constant term, so when multiplied, it's 6*20=120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying, each term is independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, since the other terms in the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Let me think.\n\nSo, the expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first binomial expansion, I can probably focus on expanding just the first part and then see how it interacts with the second part. Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) at all? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but let me check.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). Therefore, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nNow, I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the same as in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the variables are different, when we multiply, the terms won't interfere with each other. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively adding to the coefficient.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the first factor's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and the second factor is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc., but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\) because they all have \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), implying that it exists in the product. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since the second expansion includes constants, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by multiplying by the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let's find that term. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which is 6a^2b^2) by the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20), we get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part with the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me recap to ensure I haven't overlooked anything. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) with a coefficient of 20. When multiplying these two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there are other ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. For example, could there be a term from the second expansion that, when multiplied by a term from the first expansion, results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? But since the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expansion only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when terms are multiplied across the two expansions. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only contribution comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific term in the product. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that term must come from a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(1\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 is \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^n \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of the term that, when multiplied by 6, will give me a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) and not any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that might not be correct because each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Let me check that.\n\nWait, so the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficients.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second part, so \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms would have a coefficient, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if there's a term without any \\(c\\) terms. But since all terms from the second part involve \\(c\\) to some power, there's no term in the second part that is just a constant. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero? That can't be right, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each of those terms would have their own coefficients, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is considering all possible terms, but I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, but that seems incorrect because the second part isn't a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term, but that's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have a term with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would be zero because there's no term in the second polynomial that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) would be the middle term when expanded. Let me check that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent is zero, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Let me confirm that.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sum of coefficients being 64, but that's when \\(c = 1\\). But that's the sum of all coefficients, not just the constant term. So, in this case, since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero, we need to find that specific coefficient, which is 20, not the sum of all coefficients. So, the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6 because the other factors only affect terms that include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have various terms, but none of them involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term (if any) in the second expansion. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponent is even and we have a middle term. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with coefficients. But since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. That makes sense.\n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. When you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), because multiplying by any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (the constant term) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes a constant term (when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to see how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so does this mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that when I multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result has \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, any term involving \\(c\\) won't affect the power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, not a combined coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms come from the second part. Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you take any term from the second part that has \\(c^k\\), when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nLet me clarify. When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut let me check this logic. Suppose I have \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of the entire expression would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the only way to get a term without any \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term. Wait, that makes sense because if you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2\\). If you multiply it by any other term in the second part, you'll have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Let me compute it again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again.\n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I had considered that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the product of the coefficients from each part, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I expand both expressions and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make it a different term. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is the product of \\(6a^2b^2\\) and the constant term \\(20\\) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering different approaches and verifying my steps, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me think.\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me recall the binomial theorem: \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). Applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it doesn't because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of the second part is. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, the coefficients are binomial coefficients.

So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second part because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. Wait, that makes more sense because in the product, the only way to get a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second expansion. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me try that approach.

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to focus on the terms in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and then see how they interact with the expansion of the other part. \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to think about how this interacts with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. \n\nWait a second, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply each term from the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms. Instead, I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then realize that when I multiply it by the entire second expansion, each term will have a coefficient multiplied by 6, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the presence of \\(c\\) terms doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion would be the sum over all terms of the product of a term from each expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only looking at the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is not correct because the second expansion is separate. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, but that's not right because the second expansion is separate. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part is a separate term involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It's possible that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the product includes terms with \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term is a product of a term from each expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms in one expression don't affect the coefficients of the terms in the other expression if they don't share variables. So, since the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me think carefully. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c). But since Q(c) is a polynomial in c, it doesn't affect the coefficients of terms in P(a, b). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b), which is 6. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it doesn't affect their coefficients. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but now I'm thinking it's just 6. Which is correct? Let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. The expansion of (a + b)^2 is a^2 + 2ab + b^2. The expansion of (c + 1/c) is c + 1/c. So, the product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. Now, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in this product is zero because there are no a^2b^2 terms. Wait, that's different. \n\nWait, no, in this example, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because the product doesn't have any terms where both a and b are squared. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero, which is different from just taking the coefficient from the first part. So, in this example, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero, even though the coefficient of a^2 in the first part is 1, and the coefficient of b^2 is 1. So, when multiplied by the second part, which doesn't have any a or b terms, the coefficient of a^2b^2 remains zero. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first part is (a + b)^4, and we're looking for a^2b^2, which does exist with coefficient 6. So, when multiplied by the second part, which is (c + 1/c)^6, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by 6a^2b^2. But in the example, the coefficient of a^2b^2 was zero because there was no a^2b^2 term in the first place. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up something. Let me think again. In the original problem, the first part has a term 6a^2b^2, and the second part has terms involving c and 1/c. So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second part, I get terms like 6a^2b^2c^k for various k. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, which is a specific term without any c's. Therefore, the only way to get a term with a^2b^2 and no c's is if the second part contributes a term with c^0, which is 1. \n\nSo, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with c^0 is when the exponent of c is zero. Let me find that term. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting 6 - 2m = 0, we get m = 3. Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of c^0 in the second part is 20. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply the term 6a^2b^2 by 20, I get 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the second part, only the term with c^0 will contribute to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product. All other terms in the second part will have positive or negative exponents of c, which would make the term in the product have a^2b^2 multiplied by some power of c, which we don't want. So, only the term with c^0, which is 20, will contribute to the coefficient of a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of c^0 in the second part, which is 20. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient in the entire expression, we also consider the term with \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

That means I don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I might need to consider both expansions because the entire product is given. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would involve multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression.

So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible combinations. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Multiply these two results together, and that should give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the sum of all its coefficients. Wait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that to find the sum of coefficients, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) really 64? Because when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term, and the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so yes, it's 2^6 = 64.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a product of two polynomials, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because the \\(c\\) terms have to cancel out to give a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I don't substitute \\(c = 1\\). Instead, I consider that each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) in the second part, I multiply by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so again, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm correct. Let's consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2^1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's verify by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)\n\n\\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\)\n\nMultiplying them: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\)\n\nLooking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, if I look for \\(ab\\) in the product, the coefficient would be 2 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 4. Let's see:\n\nIn the product, the term \\(ab\\) comes from \\(2ab \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient is 2 * 2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSo, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have negative exponents, like \\(1/c\\), does that affect the coefficient? But no, because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of coefficients regardless of the exponent, so that should still work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply these, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, all these terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because in reality, each term in the product is a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you distribute, each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is the product of the two coefficients.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, I would need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6*20=120. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Suppose I consider the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all the coefficients from the second part, effectively summing them up.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to focus on the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) first, and maybe the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a constant or another factor that I can handle separately.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait a second, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the expansion of the second part? Hmm, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the terms in the second expansion that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) because only those will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term to give a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant.\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) leads to \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when considering only the constant term (since we don't want any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms), gives 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made a mistake in the calculations because each step checks out: the binomial coefficients are correct, and the exponents add up properly. So, I think the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The corresponding term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
