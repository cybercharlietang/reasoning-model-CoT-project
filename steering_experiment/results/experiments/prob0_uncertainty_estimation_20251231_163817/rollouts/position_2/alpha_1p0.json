    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, so for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), if I expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients in the second part don't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the overall coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part. So, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part can be considered as a single term, and so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the entire second part is? Hmm, that seems off.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the variables are different. So when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at whatever exponent it is. But wait, no, because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's a separate expansion. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, they don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a single term. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the 'something with c' part can be considered as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, no, because in reality, the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the question doesn't specify. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in the second expansion, but without more context, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a product, and we're supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems a bit strange. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the combined expression, which would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. That makes more sense. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check if that's the case.\n\nSo, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then that would involve multiplying by the entire expansion of the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), but just \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the answer is indeed 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a, b, c\\) all in the same term, but that doesn't make sense because they are separate variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me assume that's the case, even though it's not explicitly stated.\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Let me recalculate: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm assuming too much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a, b, c\\) all together, but that seems unlikely because they are separate variables. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nSo, starting with \\((a + b)^4\\). The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). Applying that here, \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the coefficients for each term can be found using the binomial coefficients.\n\nSimilarly, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, since \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the entire expression would be a double sum: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in this product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means, in the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), we have \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, for the first part, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we need to consider the entire product. Wait, actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in the second polynomial, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving that gives \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate those values.\n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, multiplying these together, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two terms, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficients from each part of the expansion.

In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

The expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, right? So maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then, since the second part involves \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

But that doesn't make sense because the second part has different terms with \\(c\\), so maybe the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if the second part contributes a term that's 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should treat the two parts as separate and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion because when I multiply by the first part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But wait, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the second part's terms involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me focus on \\((a + b)^4\\) first. If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Hmm, I think I need to multiply the coefficients from both parts. But wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, the terms will combine in a certain way.\n\nLet me write this out more formally. Let me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). So, when I expand \\(A\\), I get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when I expand \\(B\\), I get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the variables are different, the terms from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) won't interfere with each other when multiplying. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the coefficient from \\(B\\), but wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by all the terms in \\(B\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since \\(B\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficients from \\(B\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the same as the coefficient in \\(A\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nHmm, no, that might not be right. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each of these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) with some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply, the coefficients add up. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = k_0 + k_1c + k_2c^2 + \\dots + k_6c^6\\), where \\(k_0, k_1, ..., k_6\\) are the coefficients. So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these coefficients, resulting in \\(6k_0a^2b^2 + 6k_1a^2b^2c + 6k_2a^2b^2c^2 + \\dots + 6k_6a^2b^2c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all these terms, but since each term has a different power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would just be \\(6k_0\\), where \\(k_0\\) is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I do that?\n\nI remember that in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) will have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of them. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, so now I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought it was 6 * 20 = 120. So, which one is correct? I think I need to clarify what the problem is asking. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, I thought it was 120 because I considered only the constant term. But now I'm confused. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. Alternatively, if I look at the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 2. So, in that case, yes, it's 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, let me check another example. Suppose \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, yes, the coefficient of each term in the first expansion is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I considered only the constant term. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). Therefore, it's 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)).\n\nBut the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and each term in the second part is independent. So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by it.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I considered only the constant term. So, why the discrepancy? I think I need to clarify what exactly is being asked. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm still confused because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then I'm effectively summing all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I thought of the constant term, which was 20, and multiplied by 6 to get 120. But that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let me consider the multinomial theorem. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part will multiply it. So, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me try to calculate it differently. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me recall that the binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I should apply that here.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). That simplifies to \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, that's just the first part of the product. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, I think the next step is to figure out how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and then we have the second part multiplied by it, but I don't think \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the other part contributes a constant term, right?\n\nWait, let me think again. Actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, but that seems a bit odd because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, actually, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), that would be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a whole and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning the constant term. Because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but without any specific condition on \\(c\\), maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because it's not a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the way to do this is to consider that in the product, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what's being asked. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, so that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just a numerical coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms), we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. So, let's find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nBut let me verify that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expansion includes all possible products, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be the case. So, I think the correct approach is to consider only the constant term in the second expansion because otherwise, the coefficient would not be a single number but an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, no, that approach isn't correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the part where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, I think my initial approach was correct, that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I write the entire product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\times c^{-j}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{i}\\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, we're looking for the coefficient where \\(a^{4 - i}b^i\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, \\(i = 2\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) terms, we want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), which gives \\(j = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So applying the binomial theorem, that would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. So, that would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWait, so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two parts together, I'm going to have a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to consider all the terms in the second expansion. Instead, maybe I can just take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Or maybe I need to consider how the terms combine when multiplying.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only affected by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in the second polynomial. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by something involving \\(c\\), unless it's a constant, the resulting term will have some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, the only term in the second expansion that contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is the constant term, where the power of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, from the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) to find the term that's a constant. Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives 20 as the constant term. So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the second factor contributes a constant, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe I can consider the entire product. Let me write it out as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we can treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part as a scalar multiple when considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense, and that's what I did earlier.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I think the rest of the expression might not affect it because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which might involve more terms.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, perhaps it's considering all the terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is of the form \\(C \\cdot a^{2}b^{2} \\cdot c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of \\(C \\cdot\\) the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe it's considering all the coefficients together. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient in the expanded form, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems wrong because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6, but that can't be right because the second part is a separate expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. So, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by considering the entire expansion. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the coefficient more directly. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's see.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found before. Now, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when the exponent is zero. Let's compute that. The general term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion, giving 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be because coefficients are numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. So, let's proceed under that assumption. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the entire product and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and down to \\(a^0b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2, since each term is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with the first interpretation, that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I think the correct approach is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not sure. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expression, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire product is given.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1)^6\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me try to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because coefficients are numbers, not polynomials.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let's confirm this. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as we found earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I think the more reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to see if there's another way. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm going to double-check. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the coefficients are. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still confused because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Maybe I should go with this interpretation. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, the coefficient becomes 6 times that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it can only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expression. But that seems incorrect because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied in.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not sure. Let me think about it differently. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But without more context, it's hard to say. Given that, I think the most reasonable answer is 120, assuming the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but I just realized that if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when \\(c = 1\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But that's just the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which might not be what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, giving 384. But I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to see if there's another way. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). \n\nLet me calculate those coefficients. \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\) is 1, \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\) is 4, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\) is 4, and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\) is 1. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression is multiplied by another term, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. \n\nBut actually, wait, no. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply them, the coefficients from the second part will affect the coefficients in the first part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second part isn't a polynomial in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by the entire second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check: the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply, the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Hmm, but the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms from the second part, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression would be multiplied by each term in the second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part, hence 6*64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, maybe it's treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check: the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6*64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's contributing a factor. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, I think the intended answer is 384, which is 6 multiplied by 64, the sum of coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but to confirm, let me think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6, but that seems too simple. Given that the second part is raised to the 6th power, I think the correct approach is to multiply 6 by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but I don't think so because it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6*64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake by considering the sum of coefficients. Let me think: when you have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times each of these terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting the entire expression, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of the coefficients, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient as a number, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let me compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, no. Actually, when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting the entire polynomial coefficient. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). \n\nBut that seems too detailed, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, that would mean we need to find the term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. I think I was overcomplicating it earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so it's 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nLet me verify that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6 in the first part, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which isn't the case. The problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire product, which includes \\(c\\). So, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\).

That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what this contributes. But wait, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), does the second part affect it? Hmm, maybe not directly because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term in the second part? But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and multiply it by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not possible because each term will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, maybe we just take the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem correct either. Let me think. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and then multiply by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because for each \\(m\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but since we're summing over all \\(m\\), the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, which would be a huge number. So, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify \\(c\\), so maybe it's just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the corresponding terms. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and we're looking for a term in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right) + 15c^4\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + 20c^3\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + 15c^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + 6c\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\nSimplifying the second expansion:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\) would indeed be the sum of all those coefficients times 6. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Each term in this expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\n3. **Combine the expansions:**\n   When multiplying the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). For the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we only care about the coefficient, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n4. **Sum of coefficients in the second expansion:**\n   The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the final coefficient:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), right?\n\nSo, in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I guess I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging that in, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to think about how this interacts with the first part. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I suppose that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but it does contribute a coefficient that I need to multiply by the 6 I found earlier.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. Is that right?\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when I expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same, but the coefficient gets multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion.\n\nSo, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that might be it. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I think the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Let me try that. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems right, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you expand \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the expansion is a product of a term from each part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and in the product, it's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps we are only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a certain power? Or maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we are just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just another factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either because the second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do that, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120.\n\nHmm, so which one is correct? I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the coefficient a number, 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so it's a product of two separate expressions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4(c + d)^6\\), but that's just speculation.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify, so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems high. Let me check: the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120 when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, which is it?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s power or specifically the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. Since the problem didn't specify, I need to figure out which interpretation makes sense.\n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But given that the problem includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think about how the product works. Each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number.\n\nSo, to confirm, I'll go through the steps again:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Let me think about the entire product as a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, the only way to get a numerical coefficient is to consider the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which gives us 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the right approach. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). \n\nSo, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficients from this part just multiply the coefficients from the first part. Hmm, so perhaps I don't need to worry about \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), but just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't sound right. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to find the coefficient of that term in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. Because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But actually, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but only if we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part evaluated at a specific term. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is the product of two expansions. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the second part's coefficients. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part's terms involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, there are no \\(c\\) terms in \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which gives terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., but none of these would be \\(a^2b^2\\) alone because they all have \\(c\\) terms attached. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero because there's no term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I made a mistake. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something, but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a \\(c\\) term, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\), then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). So, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(B\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the product, considering all possible terms. But since the second part involves \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so let's compute \\(B\\) when \\(c = 1\\). \n\nSo, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's separate variables. But that seems too simplistic. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't exist in the product unless multiplied by something else, but actually, no, because in this case, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), etc., but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. \n\nWait, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. In this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present unless the exponent is higher. Wait, no, actually, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero, which matches my initial thought. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so maybe the coefficient isn't zero. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but in the simpler example, the coefficient was zero because the first part didn't have the term. So, in the original problem, since the first part does have the term, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only present if there's a term in the second part that cancels out the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which only has positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\), so there's no term with \\(c^0\\) unless we consider the constant term. \n\nWait, actually, in the second part, when expanded, there is a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, specifically when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the general term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, to clarify, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me double-check this. In the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when multiplying the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Identify the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   For the term to be constant (\\(c^0\\)), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nSo, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\), I can expand this. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\). Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's see, when does \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) become \\(a^2b^2\\)? That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Similarly, I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Here, \\(x = c\\), \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).\n\nSimplifying that term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\), so the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, I think the key here is that since the two parts of the original expression are multiplied together, the terms will multiply. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the coefficients from each expansion because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't involve \\(c\\), the variables are independent. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nBut let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me a polynomial in \\(c\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the entire expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that seems a bit confusing because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients that are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is only considering the coefficient in the combined expression, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might be the case because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part gets multiplied by the entire second polynomial, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let me compute that.\n\nPlugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, if the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and I'm multiplying by another polynomial where each term contributes a coefficient, then the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the expansion more directly. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which we know has a coefficient of 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in this expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so that's 2^6 = 64, as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from other combinations in the product? For example, could there be cross terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, but that would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to say that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Another approach: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is 6. But wait, that's just the first part. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of that part as well and then see how the terms combine.\n\nLet me tackle the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\). Calculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, I need to multiply the two expansions together: \\((a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4)\\) and \\((c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). But wait, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't need to multiply all the terms; I can focus on the terms that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by any term from the second expansion.\n\nIn the first expansion, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is present. When I multiply this by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it doesn't matter what the power of \\(c\\) is; we just need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each multiplication by a term in the second expansion will add a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms combine. So, in the first expansion, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is present, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might only be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but I think that's how it works because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, and when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, regardless of \\(c\\), when multiplied, will just add 6 times each coefficient of the second expansion to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm a bit unsure.\n\nWait, let me check this again. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on, up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems correct, but I want to make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be any even integer from -6 to 6. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is obtained by multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, and since each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, that's \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, let me check if the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interact differently, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part's coefficients sum to 64, it's 6 times 64.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part is 20, so the total coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, no, that approach would be if I were only considering the constant term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, it's not just the constant term; it's all terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if I were to consider only the constant term, it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will include all possible products of \\(a^2b^2\\) with each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients might not just multiply like that. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) from the first part, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them gives \\(a^2c + 2abc + b^2c + a^2/c + 2ab/c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when considering all terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of the coefficients, which is 2. So, in that case, it works. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a coefficient. So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\), it would be 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^2/c\\) would be 1. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interact differently, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider the entire product and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. When you multiply the two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, and then summed up, which is the same as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they multiply together.\n\nSo, starting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that here, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let's compute that coefficient.\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Calculating that: \\(4! = 24\\), and \\(2! = 2\\), so it's \\(24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly interested in the terms of \\(c\\) here, but since the entire expression is multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), I might need to consider how the terms from both expansions interact. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about cross terms? Hmm, perhaps I can treat the two parts as separate and just multiply the coefficients accordingly.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents are independent. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, I need to multiply it by some term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part.\n\nSo, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is just a constant. Let me see, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check that I didn't miss anything. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me a constant term of 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 * 1\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because the second part only has \\(c\\) terms, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. There's no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the second part, so no cross terms or anything like that. So, I think my reasoning is solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) from the second part. Since the second part only has \\(c\\) terms, the only such term is the constant term, which is 20. So, that's another way to see that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly, and the exponents were handled properly. So, yeah, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, let me write that out using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\).

So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). That means I have to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, I think I need to multiply the entire expressions together. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be a product where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can separate the problem into two parts: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and then see how it interacts with the other part.\n\nWait, but if I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of products, not just a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might be the case.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the question is only asking about the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, when we expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is some exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. So, in this case, \\(k = 2\\), so the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2 as well. Then, the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything, but we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the entire expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, maybe that's the case. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand the product, each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of all coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term, which would mean that each term \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) has a coefficient, and the problem is asking for the sum of all such coefficients. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me write the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, that simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\), the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(m\\) values, each multiplied by 6. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\), which is indeed 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. In that case, we'd need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second part would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that's different.\n\nWait, so I'm confused now. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term, which would be 384, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) term, which might imply that it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, in that case, it's 384. But I'm not 100% sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make more sense if the problem is from a textbook or something. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), so setting that equal to zero gives \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that in the product, each term is a combination of the two expansions, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term would be the sum of all possible coefficients from the second expansion times 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then it would be 120, but since it's not specified, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler expression, say \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding it, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 if I set \\(c = 1\\). But in reality, it's a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient isn't a single number unless I sum all coefficients by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Let me check that possibility again.\n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) from all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since we're considering the entire product, we multiply this by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by looking at each part separately and then combine them somehow.\n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem. It states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the coefficient for that term.\n\nIn the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure how this interacts with the first part. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part just contributes a constant factor or something, and I don't need to consider it when looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is multiplied together. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But that seems off because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, so actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part does involve \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms in the product, but only in the context of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a variable that can take certain values, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only term from the second expansion that would affect it is the constant term, because any term involving \\(c\\) would make the product have a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would not be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two together to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, first, let's confirm the coefficient in the first part. As I did earlier, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). \n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n\\(-2m = -6\\)\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term occurs when \\(m = 3\\). The term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so the coefficient is 120? Let me just verify that.\n\nYes, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), any term from the second expansion that isn't a constant would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, only the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire product out, it would be \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a sum of terms involving powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the constant term that would pair with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without \\(c\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expressions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a sum, not a single term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part, if any.\n\nWait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, there is a constant term when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by 20, which is the constant term in the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nWait, but is that the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by other terms in the second polynomial, like \\(c^2\\) or \\(1/c^2\\), those would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second part. So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the coefficients. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider another approach. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The first expansion gives me terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second gives me terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), which gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again to make sure the constant term is indeed 20. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which equals 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem, that would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(a^{4 - 2} = a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms affect it. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the entire expression is a product, and when you expand it, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of the second part, each of those would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^3\\), then the term is \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^3\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so maybe we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part and then multiply by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But when considering the coefficient in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if each term in the product has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me verify this another way. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), the coefficient of a specific term in P that doesn't involve c, like \\(a^2b^2\\), would be the coefficient of that term in P times the entire Q(c), because Q(c) is a polynomial in c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in Q(c) gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But when you're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, you have to sum all the coefficients from Q(c) because each term in Q(c) contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)).\n\nAnd the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is Q(1), which is \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). When you multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P would be multiplied by each term in Q, which are coefficients times powers of c. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each of those coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of the coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of Q(c), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's power, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q(c), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another approach: maybe I should expand both parts and see. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the powers \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\) respectively.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, giving terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 c^6\\), \\(6 a^2b^2 c^4\\), \\(6 a^2b^2 c^2\\), \\(6 a^2b^2 c^0\\), etc. So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and a power of c.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nAs calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed when c = 1, so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I consider the entire product as a polynomial in a, b, c. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part doesn't involve a or b, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P and Q, where P is in variables a and b, and Q is in variable c. Then, the product P * Q will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product P * Q would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of the coefficients in Q, because each term in Q is a coefficient times a power of c, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times a power of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from P times the sum of the coefficients in Q.\n\nSince the sum of coefficients in Q is Q evaluated at c = 1, which is \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The terms with \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, this seems to work.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Let's check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying, the terms with \\(a^2\\) would be \\(a^2 c^2\\), \\(a^2 * 2\\), \\(a^2 * 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 4, which is correct. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would also be 4, and the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 4 = 8, but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo, this method seems to hold. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else, but I think the method is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but that's not quite right because the second part doesn't involve a or b. So, the coefficient in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, as each term in the second part adds to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write down the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So I think I also need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me write that down. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), I guess I need to find the product of these two expansions and look for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, I need to find the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the term.\n\nSo setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that contributes to the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So the term is \\(20c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply together. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 120. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second polynomial. So the only contribution comes from the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving 20. Therefore, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that in the product, only the constant term from the second polynomial affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Got that part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating things. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only considering the constant term? Or perhaps the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me clarify. The expression is a product of two independent expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would be a combination of a term from each expansion.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), but that's only possible if the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the constant term in the second part would result in a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we're looking for.\n\nSo, first, let's confirm that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand both, each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, so to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to multiply it by a term from the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. So, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, now I need to compute two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on the second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But no, that's not correct because the second part isn't just a constant; it's an expansion in terms of \\(c\\). So, only the constant term would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied together.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms in } c)\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to pick the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, when you have multiple variables, the way the terms combine can be tricky, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the cross terms wouldn't affect each other. So, the coefficient should just be the product of the two individual coefficients.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the binomial coefficients.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That's correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is found by solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
