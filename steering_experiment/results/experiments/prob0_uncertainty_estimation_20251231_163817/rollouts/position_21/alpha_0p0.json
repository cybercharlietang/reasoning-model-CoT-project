    "text": " But since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part?

But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, if I want to find the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that is, where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) for \\(m\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. Let me calculate that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is at \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1.

    "text": " But since we're looking for a specific term in the product, which is \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a separate factor. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have multiple terms. Wait, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum from the other part. But that doesn't make sense because the other part isn't a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because only that term will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. So, let me break this down: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), so that's the term we're interested in. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering each part separately. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't affect each other. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first polynomial. The second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and since the second part is being multiplied by the entire expression, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, let me confirm this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term of the expansion, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, which equals 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that we were considering all terms in the second polynomial, but actually, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but if we consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm confused now because I'm not sure whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). The problem states: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, it would specify that it's regardless of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. But let me double-check. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But I think the standard interpretation is that the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials refers to the coefficient when considering all variables, so in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to form a term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are specified. Therefore, the correct answer is 120. I think I'm overcomplicating it, but I believe 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering both parts of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, when you multiply these two, you're combining all terms from both expansions. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because coefficients are constants, not expressions with variables. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those will be separate terms, each with their own coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, is that correct? Because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. So, that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me try a different method. Maybe I should consider the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is formed by taking a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiplying them together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each of those terms has a coefficient, and when you multiply, the coefficients multiply. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. That seems to make sense. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, that sum is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's correct.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we just need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would give us a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a very large expression. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears is when it's multiplied by some term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, let's try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm confused now. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so that the answer is 120. Let me think. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's 384. But that seems a bit odd because when you have multiple variables, usually the coefficient is considered in the context of all variables. Wait, but in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe it's 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it another way. If I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as I found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we recognize that this coefficient must be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and we need to add them all up. Wait, but actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when you multiply a term with \\(c^k\\) by a term without \\(c\\), you just get a term with \\(c^k\\), but if you want the product to have no \\(c\\) terms, you need to multiply by the term where \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term. Wait, but actually, no. Let me think again. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms where each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not all constants. Let me clarify: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term contributes its own coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Wait, but that seems a bit off because the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by the coefficients. But actually, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the multiplication of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^k\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, the constant term is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's denote this as \\((a + b)^4 \\times D\\), where \\(D = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by \\(D\\), because when you multiply by \\(D\\), which is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it just scales the entire term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times D\\), where \\(D = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps we need to consider that \\(D\\) itself is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times D\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(D\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But wait, that can't be right because \\(D\\) is a function of \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but we're only interested in the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms that are products of the terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to suggest that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to 0, which is 1. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the power of \\(c\\) is 0.

So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. Let me double-check my reasoning. I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6. Then, I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as 20. Multiplying them gives 120.

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not expressions. Hmm, I think I made a mistake in my approach. Let me try again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to look at the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found before. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they all contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, as I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expression is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the entire expression as a single polynomial, and thus the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the second part is being multiplied, so it would affect the coefficient. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times 1, which is 6, but that doesn't seem right. I'm confused now. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand both parts separately and then see how the terms combine. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they all contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check: the second expansion has coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would be 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. But I think that's the case because when you multiply, the coefficient gets scaled by the sum of the coefficients from the other expansion. So, I think the answer is 384. But let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, to recap: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have some power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative. So, how does that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), that means we need the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). When you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other expansion has terms with \\(c\\), unless the term is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), it won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, only the constant term in the second expansion will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if there was a term with \\(c^1\\), would that somehow combine with another term to give a \\(c^0\\) when multiplied by something else? Hmm, no, because when you multiply two terms, the exponents add. So, if you have a term with \\(c^1\\) from the second expansion and a term with \\(c^{-1}\\) from another part, but in our case, the first expansion only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(c^0\\) is to take the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it's specifically \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), etc. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the constant term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the constant term in the second part will result in a term that has no \\(c\\) in it, thus keeping \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term. So, I think that's the key. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.

So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Let me check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables multiply to give the desired term. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only take the constant term from the second polynomial, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20, and multiply it by the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, when we multiply these expressions, the terms will combine as products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as before, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. I don't think I'm missing any other terms because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it can't come from any other combination of terms in the second expansion. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. Actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and I multiply it by \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents don't interfere. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no. That's not correct because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 64, which is 384. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if you have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply, you can get terms where the exponents cancel, like \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that I was multiplying by all coefficients, but actually, since we're looking for a specific term where \\(c\\) cancels, it's only 20, so 6*20=120. That makes more sense. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To get \\(c^0\\), set the exponent to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6, as we found, and then we need to find the term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again.

We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term, which is 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me just check if I considered all the terms properly. Since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), any term from the second expansion that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would not contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because it would introduce \\(c\\) factors, which aren't present in the term we're looking for. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I did this correctly.

So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in the other expansion, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest of the terms (those involving \\(c\\)) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think 384 is the correct coefficient. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be the product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms would be the product of the two coefficients. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but the other part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Okay, that makes more sense. So, I need to consider both expansions and find where the exponents add up to the desired term. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as before. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNext, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the general term in the product will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's set up the equations:\n\n1. For \\(a\\): \\(4 - k = 2\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 2\\).\n2. For \\(b\\): \\(k = 2\\).\n3. For \\(c\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(2m = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term we are interested in is when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\).\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients for these values:\n\n- From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n- From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of these two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(m = 3\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, the coefficients are 6 and 20, respectively, and their product is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. That would make sense because it's a specific term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part of the expression that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. So, to be thorough, let's consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we would have a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. So, that interpretation is probably incorrect.\n\nSecond interpretation: The problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense because it's a specific term in the product. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nLet me confirm this by considering the entire product. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we need to find the term in the second polynomial where \\(c^0\\) occurs, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), as I found before. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem to be the case because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see if there's a different term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part contributes the \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see what the constant term is. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). To find where the exponent is 0, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120 when considering the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression. Specifically, the coefficient is 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the constant term in \\(c\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, to find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through it again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's correct. I don't think I need to consider any other terms because other terms in the second expansion would involve powers of \\(c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I'm pretty confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because any term that includes \\(c\\) won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the other expansion, it will still have the \\(c\\) part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power.

So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and it's looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the other expansion, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but since the problem didn't specify, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because each term in the expansion will have different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Because then, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\). That seems plausible. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6.\n\nNext, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But since we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the constant term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is that the correct approach? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient is a single number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is likely asking for a numerical coefficient, so the first interpretation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct too. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
