    "text": " So, maybe I should consider that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect this coefficient because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times 1, but that doesn't seem right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion. Wait, maybe the way to approach this is to realize that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each term in the product is formed by taking a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only formed by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply by something, the coefficients don't just add up like that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) that cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, maybe I need to find the term where in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^0\\), you get a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need to find the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) is in the second, their product gives \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because if you take any term with a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) from the second part, then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's a constant, because if we take any term with a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we want. So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me just check my calculations again to be sure. \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would produce a sum of terms where each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term from the other expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we need to find the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because each term in that expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.

But wait, let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a term in \\(P(a, b)\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\), but that seems incorrect because \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate variable. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), but I'm not sure. Let me try to clarify. Suppose I have \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\), but since \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), each term is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) dependence. So, that implies that only the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product because any term with \\(c\\) would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, which we're not interested in. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), which is the constant term. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

When you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero, which wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, actually, I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\), so it doesn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other expansion. So, that's 6 (from earlier) multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Yeah, that makes sense because when you multiply, you're combining terms, and only the constant term from the \\(c\\) part will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) factors. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate part. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be the case if we were collecting all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to calculate the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems a bit off because the problem is about a single term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I can ignore the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the first part, and the second part would contribute a factor that is multiplied by it. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part isn't a single number, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would only happen if the second part contributes a term that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion, you get a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which would be the coefficient we're looking for. So, let me break it down into two parts: 1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). 2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product.\n\nStarting with part 1: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, part 2: The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from part 2 is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part) equals 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it gets multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Is that correct? Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). And as I said earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part? Or is it 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the \\(c\\) part? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all those products. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The \\(c\\) part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear unless multiplied by something else, but in this case, the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, no, actually, in this example, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the highest degree in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but in the product, each term would be like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2*(1/c)\\), \\(2ab*c\\), \\(2ab*(1/c)\\), etc. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear in this product. So, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Wait, so in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the \\(c\\) expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6*64=384. But in my small example, \\((a + b)^2*(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Wait, that seems contradictory. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like a huge number, 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the \\(c\\) expansion, but that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be in a single variable, but as it's written, it's in three variables: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product with coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but the problem didn't specify that. So, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, and then see how the product looks. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let's do that: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. Because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^{something}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^{something}\\). But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about another way. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms each with a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if I think of the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems too much. Wait, no, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all terms where the product includes \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, when multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, the coefficient becomes 6 times each coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion could have different coefficients, but since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second expansion, it would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, then I found the constant term in the second part, which is 20, and multiplied them together to get 120. That seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat the \\(c\\) part as a separate expansion and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is a single term, so when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part, because any term multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify: when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their exponents are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems possible. So, if I can find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by 6, which is the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, I would get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Let me check that logic. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Let me write out the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then when multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me confirm with another method. Let me think of the entire expansion as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and then it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. But that would mean that the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\).

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me check that. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that seems more plausible. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) since each term in the expansion has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me confirm this because I'm not entirely sure. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so we have to consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is irrelevant because \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of both terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I should treat the two parts separately and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Wait, so if I'm looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, as we did before. Now, let's consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion of this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion has a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term has a specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, making the exponent zero. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. For the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it's affected by the other part. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, I'm looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That is, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), what is the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not right because when you expand, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because each term has a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so we need to consider the entire coefficient, including the \\(c\\) parts. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not constants; they are coefficients multiplied by powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can have any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems like the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If that's the case, then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the entire expansion. So, let's approach it that way. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), we get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the problem might be asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), but if it's asking for the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\), then perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the answer is 120. Let me double-check that. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the relevant terms from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion.\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n   - The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term, and the other part can be any term from the second expansion, which might have different exponents for \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which would give me \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in that expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems possible, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply by all the terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficients would carry over. But wait, in the problem, are we considering terms with \\(c\\) as part of the term \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or is \\(a^2b^2\\) independent of \\(c\\)? Because in the original expression, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these would give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 15 = 90, and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the second part is multiplied by 1? But \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless one of the terms in the expansion is \\(c^0 = 1\\). Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\) as \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6. So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), that is, when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the only term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense because only the constant term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term to give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\). So, I think the correct coefficient is 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6. Then, I considered the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found that the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) is 20. Therefore, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

So, if I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, meaning the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because if the term in the second expansion is, say, \\(c^k\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero, meaning \\(k = 0\\). So, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try to find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So that's 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the entire expression is the product of these two, which means that each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term would be when we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find both coefficients. I've already found the first one: 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion, but I think I'm correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, considering all variables. Wait, no, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant here. Hmm, but let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, so when you multiply it by the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{terms involving } c\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. But that would mean considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem as stated is only \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect it. But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first expansion, and then it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number, it's an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and the second part is irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider that the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is a red herring. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But what's the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That would be the value when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. So, let's compute that. Let me set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if we're considering all possible terms, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is in the denominator, it's a bit tricky. Wait, but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Suppose instead of 6, the exponent on the second part was 1, so \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1 = c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\). Then, the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 2 = 12. Let me compute the product: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, multiplying by \\(c + 1/c\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by \\(c\\) and by \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would become \\(6a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6c + 6/c, which is 6(c + 1/c). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is even. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps this is the intended answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is separate. But no, because the entire expression is multiplied, so each term in the expansion would include both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the numerical coefficient when considering all variables. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).
