    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that's when \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). The coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient I just found. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will involve some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that results in \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will keep the term as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, but actually, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720/36, which is 20. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When I multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, then indeed, I just need to take the coefficient from the first part (6) and multiply it by the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients to make sure I didn't miscalculate. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), it's 6, which is correct because 4 choose 2 is 6. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), it's 20, which is correct because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the product is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term from this part is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). That simplifies to \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). \n\nLooking at that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, that part seems straightforward. Now, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. \n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would give me \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion will have a power of \\(c\\) that's \\(6 - 2k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. The coefficients here are the binomial coefficients: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 6\\) respectively.\n\nNow, the original problem is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has powers of \\(c\\). \n\nHowever, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion only involves powers of \\(c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the variables won't interfere with each other. \n\nThis means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the sums of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up appropriately. But in this case, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the second expansion is just a scalar multiple. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, \\(a^3b\\) will be multiplied by each term, and so on. \n\nBut the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that can't be, because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which are separate variables. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), then the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\). Because when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each of those terms. \n\nBut wait, no. Because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so the coefficient for \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\), regardless of the power of \\( c \\), it's actually the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right either. Because when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term in the second expansion, you're creating terms like \\( a^2b^2c^k \\) where \\( k \\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\), not considering the \\( c \\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term, you're getting different terms in the product. So, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term, you're scaling \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each of those terms. \n\nWait, but that's not exactly right because the second expansion isn't just a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\( c \\). So, when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term in the second expansion, you're creating terms like \\( a^2b^2c^k \\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\), regardless of the power of \\( c \\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a scalar multiple, so when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term, you're effectively adding up all those scalar multiples as coefficients for \\( a^2b^2 \\). \n\nWait, but no, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\( a^2b^2 \\), so the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a scalar, so when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each scalar, you're just scaling \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each scalar and adding them all up. \n\nSo, let me confirm: The coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFirst, we already found that the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThe sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\( c = 1 \\). So, if we substitute \\( c = 1 \\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire product is \\( 6 \\times 64 = 384 \\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are separate variables from \\( c \\), the exponents of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) don't interact with the exponents of \\( c \\). So, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a scalar (in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)). \n\nSo, effectively, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\( c \\), when we're considering the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) regardless of \\( c \\)'s power, we have to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\( a^2b^2 \\). \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated by substituting \\( c = 1 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is \\( 6 \\times 64 = 384 \\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. But since Q(c) is a polynomial in c, and P(a, b) is a polynomial in a and b, the variables are independent. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product, it's the same as the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because Q(c) is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, actually, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in P(a, b) multiplied by each term in Q(c), but since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of c's power, it's just the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in P(a, b) times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term in Q(c), you get terms like \\( a^2b^2c^k \\), but the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in P(a, b) times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times a power of c, and when multiplied by \\( a^2b^2 \\), it becomes \\( a^2b^2 \\) times that coefficient times c^k. So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) regardless of c, it's the same as the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in Q(c) is 64, as we calculated. Therefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think of a simpler example to verify. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^2 is 1 (since (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2). The sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c) is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c). The term a^2b^2 would come from a^2 * b^2 * (c + 1/c), but wait, no, because a^2 is multiplied by b^2 only if we have a^2 * b^2, but in reality, when you multiply (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) by (c + 1/c), the a^2 term is multiplied by c and 1/c, giving a^2c and a^2/c. Similarly, the b^2 term is multiplied by c and 1/c, giving b^2c and b^2/c. There's no a^2b^2 term in the product because the variables are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is zero, not 2. \n\nWait, so my previous reasoning was wrong. That means I made a mistake earlier. So, in this simpler case, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because there's no term where a^2 and b^2 are multiplied together in the product. Each term in the product is either a^2c, a^2/c, 2ab*c, 2ab/c, b^2c, or b^2/c. There's no term where a^2 is multiplied by b^2. So, the coefficient is zero. \n\nBut according to my earlier reasoning, I would have said the coefficient is 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, that means my initial approach was wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink this. \n\nSo, what's the correct approach? Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the two polynomials are in different variables, the exponents don't interfere. So, for the term \\( a^2b^2 \\), it can only come from multiplying the \\( a^2b^2 \\) term in the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., the term where c^0) in the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by any other term in the second polynomial, you'll get a term involving c, which won't be just \\( a^2b^2 \\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\), regardless of the power of c. So, actually, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) can be multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, but the variables c don't affect the a and b terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial? \n\nBut that can't be right because the second polynomial is a sum of terms with different powers of c. So, when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\( a^2b^2c^k \\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\), not considering the power of c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but in the simpler example I tried earlier, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSo, the variables are a, b, and c. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term where a and b are raised to the second power, but it doesn't specify anything about c. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of c, but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. \n\nWait, but that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you have to consider all possible ways that term can be formed. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in c, and the first is in a and b, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by any term in the second polynomial, because the variables are separate. \n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) will have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the c terms, it would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k. \n\nBut that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, that might make more sense. Because if you're just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether you're considering all powers of c or just the term where c is raised to zero. \n\nIn the simpler example I tried earlier, where I had \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\), if I follow the approach where I multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial, I get 1 * 1 = 1, but in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first polynomial only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), and you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from multiplying two terms unless you have a term in the first polynomial that has both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), which you do, but in the second polynomial, you have to multiply it by the constant term to get \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present at all. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero, because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two polynomials. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when you multiply it by the second polynomial, you can get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nBut in my earlier example, that approach gave the wrong answer, so I must be misunderstanding something. \n\nLet me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the two polynomials are in different variables, the exponents don't interfere. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by any term in the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nIn the simpler example, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient in the product is zero, which matches reality. \n\nIn the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in my earlier test case, I thought that approach was wrong, but now it seems correct. Let me clarify. \n\nIn the test case, \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is zero, so the coefficient in the product is zero, which is correct because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nIn another test case, suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(1 + c\\right)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is zero, so the coefficient in the product is zero. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(1 + 1\\right)^1\\), then the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2, but since the first polynomial doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), the product's coefficient is zero. \n\nBut if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(1 + c\\right)^1\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), then it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, the product would have terms \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is correct. \n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach was correct, and the confusion came from the test case where the first polynomial didn't have the term in question. \n\nSo, to summarize: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the sum of its coefficients by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\n3. Multiply these two results together: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this as \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I'm thinking that maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the other terms? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, actually, because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Wait, that makes sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms, each of which would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in a sum of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't sound right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But that can't be right because \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I think I might be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, in the final expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and we don't care about the exponents of \\(c\\). If that's the case, then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384, as I thought earlier. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me check again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems high, so maybe I'm making a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. So, in that case, we'd need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that gives \\(c^0\\), which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nSo, let me approach it that way. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem was probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 384, but that seems unlikely because the problem mentions both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in the expression, so it's more probable that they want the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, as I thought earlier, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers depending on how I interpret the problem. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the answer would be 384 because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would accumulate all those multiples. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively.\n\nSo, to find that, I first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's think about the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that gives us the term from \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, for each \\(m\\), we have a term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but since \\(m\\) can vary from 0 to 6, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\).\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. But given that the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, it's more likely that they want the coefficient where \\(c\\) is also at a specific power, probably zero, so the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients that are multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively.\n\nSo, to find that, as I did earlier, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a standard way to present coefficients. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check another way. Let's expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), which is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\).\n\nSo, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIf we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire sum, which is 6 * 64 = 384, but that's not a standard way to present coefficients because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm still a bit unsure. Let me see if there's another way to interpret this. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a standard coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem wants the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, regardless of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient isn't a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not how coefficients are usually presented; coefficients are numerical values, not expressions. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That simplifies to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together.\n\nI remember that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will depend on the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of whatever term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. Since \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. So, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that can't be right because then it would be 6 times something, but I think that's not the case. Wait, no, actually, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that's not quite right either. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). But in our case, we're not summing the coefficients; we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the second part involves \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponent of \\(c\\) doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is just a separate expansion that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply 6 times the entire second expansion, but that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all possible terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that's not quite right because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Usually, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you consider the term in the entire expression, including all variables. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that's not standard either. Typically, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible exponents of the other variables. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, the coefficient is specific to all variables. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\) or something else. But no, the problem is as given. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\), but that's not what's given. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, and the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nThe sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that seems high. Let me check. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it as a single expression. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAs I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is ambiguous. If it's considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. If it's considering the term where \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard; usually, the coefficient is specific to all variables. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That seems more likely. So, in that case, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\), but that's not the case. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a product of two separate expansions, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part contributes to the overall coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they're separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, the first expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms just add a factor that's multiplied by 1 in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't sound right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever comes from the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum up to \\(2^6\\).\n\nWait, let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in that expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to some extent. Because otherwise, if I just multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would be 6 times 64, but that would include terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so it's a product of two separate binomial expansions. When you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think differently. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but without any specific power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, you have to consider all possible combinations. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where \\(c^0\\). Let me check that. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's expecting me to consider the entire expansion, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm confused. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any condition on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these terms multiplied by 6. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because the problem is presented as if it's a single coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, leading to 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), which suggests that we're to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems too large. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to approach it methodically.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficients \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. That is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the second expansion, the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in typical problems like this, when only the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are specified, it's often implied that we're looking for the term independent of \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, leading to 384. However, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But I'm not 100% sure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But since it's just \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, often when multiple variables are present, the coefficient is considered with respect to all variables, meaning that the other variables are treated as coefficients. But in this case, \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still unsure. Let me try to compute both possibilities:\n\n1. If considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n2. If considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify, I think the correct answer is 120, as it's more likely that the problem is expecting the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I'll go with 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me calculate both:\n\n- Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 6 * 64 = 384.\n- Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven the problem's wording, I think it's more probable that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about how the problem is structured. It's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, it's a product of two separate binomial expansions. When you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term in the second, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be a sum over all those terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a single number, 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where \\(a^{2}\\) and \\(b^{2}\\). So, the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That should correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, maybe I need to consider how the terms from both expansions interact.\n\nWait, no, actually, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that's the only term that would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to keep it as \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by \\(c^k\\) from the second part, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the term where \\(k = 0\\), so that \\(c^0 = 1\\), and then \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, I need the exponent on \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the coefficient from the second part. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply with the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient will be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion? For example, if there were terms with \\(c\\) that could combine to give \\(c^0\\), but I think that's already accounted for by the \\(c^0\\) term. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product and consider all possible combinations, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 should be the coefficient.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent on \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by whatever comes from the second part.

But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire second expression, so unless \\(c\\) is involved, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible combinations from both expansions. But no, actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think differently. Suppose I don't consider the second part and just focus on the first part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. \n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Actually, in the product, each term is a product of terms from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because polynomials are being multiplied, not scalars.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a single term, say \\(K\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4 \\times K\\), which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(K\\). \n\nBut that's not correct because \\(K\\) is not a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(K\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(K\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(K\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(K\\), because each term in \\(K\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(K\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me verify this because I might be confusing the concepts. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the part of the expression involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part involving \\(c\\) doesn't influence the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. \n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients are combined when multiplying the polynomials.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), we're just looking for the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as calculated before by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this again because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect it because we're only looking at the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think differently: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that combine to form that term and the coefficients of terms in the second polynomial. \n\nIn this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times every term in the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSince the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). \n\nBut in reality, when you expand \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c\\), which is a variable, not a number. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's in the context of the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem might be asking for the coefficient as a scalar, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in the example I just did, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c\\), which is a term, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a polynomial in \\(c\\) as the coefficient. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)?\" So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but maybe the problem wants the coefficient as a scalar, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in the example I did, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a polynomial, but the way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient, which is usually a scalar. So, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. \n\nBut in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial, so perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for that polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a scalar, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all the terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is only interested in the scalar coefficient, meaning the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), so perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\), which would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). \n\nBut that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a scalar coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and thus the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting a polynomial as the coefficient. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a scalar, so I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense because then you would have a scalar coefficient. \n\nBut assuming the problem is correctly written, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that combine to form that term and the coefficients of terms in the second polynomial that combine to form the corresponding term. \n\nIn this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) was a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a polynomial as the coefficient, but since it's asking for \"the coefficient\", it's more likely a scalar. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). That means the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is multiplied by the second part, which is another binomial raised to the 6th power. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the second part? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. So, when I multiply them together, the terms from each expansion will combine.\n\nBut, hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't interact with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) when multiplying.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, any term from the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot (1/c)^k\\). But the original question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or anything else. So, actually, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way we don't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. Otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), or just the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)? \n\nI think it's the latter, because if it were the former, it would have specified something like the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a particular \\(k\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and in the second part, I can have any term because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot (1/c)^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that seems too broad. Let me clarify: The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term.\n\nWait, so the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when we set \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second polynomial, each term has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, each term in the second part will contribute to a term in the product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's as if we're summing over all possible coefficients from the second part, which is 64, and then multiplying by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand this:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is the sum of coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which are 1 and 1, so total 2. But according to my previous logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 2. So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. So, in this smaller example, it works.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient should be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two independent polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion for a smaller exponent to see.\n\nLet's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\).\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nMultiplying them:\n\n\\(a^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + 2ab(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + b^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\). Wait, but 1 * 4 = 4, but in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, but according to my logic, it should be 1 * (sum of coefficients in the second part) = 1 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 4. But in reality, it's 2. So, my earlier logic is flawed.\n\nHmm, so that means my approach is incorrect. I need to figure out where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, but according to the logic, it should be 1 * 4 = 4. So, that's not matching. Therefore, my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe I need to think differently. Let's see.\n\nIn the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2. Let's see how that comes about.\n\nLooking at the expansion, \\(a^2\\) comes from \\(a^2 \\times 1\\) in the second part, but actually, no, in the expansion, it's \\(a^2 \\times 2\\), because the second part has a term \\(2\\) which is \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from the first part) multiplied by 2 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part). So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches.\n\nTherefore, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nAh! That makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second part, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) is to multiply by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 2, which is correct because \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the constant term is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier conclusion of 384. So, now I'm confused because in the smaller example, this approach worked, but in my initial approach, I thought it was 384, but that was wrong because the smaller example showed that approach was incorrect. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this with the smaller example again to make sure.\n\nIn the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1 in the first part, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 2. So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches the expansion. Similarly, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\), it would be 2 in the first part, and 2 in the second part, so 2 * 2 = 4. But in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is correct.\n\nWait, in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2 (from the first part) times 2 (from the second part). So, that works.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. I initially made a mistake by thinking that the coefficient would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that's not the case. Instead, it's multiplied by the coefficient of the term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is the constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but those terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically would only come from the constant term in the second expansion because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) attached, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, that's the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). If I multiply by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), I'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms, so their coefficients don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me confirm that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, I need the constant term in the second expansion because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give me a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2k = 6\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so the coefficient is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), and that term's coefficient is 20. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two independent expansions, the coefficients multiply when you take the product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and the constant term comes from the second expansion with coefficient 20, so the combined coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

That means the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the problem also involves \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think this part doesn't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the specific terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) might just add a constant factor. \n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't change the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that would mean we're looking for the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so it doesn't affect the variables. \n\nSo, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and all other terms would involve some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want.\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nActually, \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(20c^0\\). Multiplying them together, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and realized that to get a term without \\(c\\), I needed the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, which happens when the exponent is 0. That occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nSo, applying that to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me see, so if the term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well? But how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nWait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is multiplied by it, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms might not affect it because they are separate variables. \n\nWait, but no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the variables are different. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate expansions, one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the two parts separately. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but none of these involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first expansion, we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^n = 2^n\\). So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the two expansions are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part, but since the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first expansion, the highest power of \\(b\\) is 2, but in the second expansion, you can only get up to \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so \\(b^2\\) would require a term with \\(b^2\\) and something else, but since the second expansion doesn't have \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. Wait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. \n\nWait, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the second expansion. But in my original problem, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, the only terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) are those where the second factor contributes a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the second factor contributes a term with \\(c^k\\), then the product term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so maybe I'm wrong earlier. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the product to have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) must be \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me double-check. \n\nIn the first approach, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that approach was incorrect because the second expansion doesn't contribute to the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Instead, the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because only the term where the second expansion contributes \\(c^0\\) will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me verify this with a smaller example to ensure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in the expansion, the highest power of \\(b\\) is 2, but the second expansion doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no way to get \\(b^2\\) from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient is zero because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so the product can't have \\(a^2b^2\\). But in my original problem, the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second expansion contributes a constant term. So, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, but in the smaller example, since the second expansion doesn't have a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. \n\nWait, let me calculate the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), so there is no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2(c + 1/c)^1\\) is zero. \n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, I think my second approach is correct, and the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check another example to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2c*(1/c) + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the constant term is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^1\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^1\\) is 1, and the constant term is 2, so the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nIf I expand the entire product, \\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), the term \\(a\\) would multiply each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a c^2 + 2a + a/c^2\\). Similarly, \\(b\\) would multiply each term, giving \\(b c^2 + 2b + b/c^2\\). So, the term \\(a\\) multiplied by the constant term 2 gives \\(2a\\), which is the only term with \\(a\\) and no \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which matches 1 * 2. \n\nSimilarly, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(ab\\), I would look for terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be zero. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. \n\nSo, after going through this reasoning and verifying with smaller examples, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. That would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, looking at the expansion, that term would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{4 - 2}b^2\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So plugging in the numbers, that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So when I multiply these two, I need to consider how the terms from each expansion will interact. \n\nHowever, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will multiply each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Instead, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, their coefficients remain the same. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the entire second part, which doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right either. Because the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. But when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, that might make sense. Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial doesn't interact with the second polynomial in a way that affects the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut wait, actually, the second expansion doesn't have a term that affects \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient that's multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first part). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the coefficient just gets multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion isn't being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\); rather, each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me verify that. Because if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Each of those terms has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we need a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will create a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from second expansion}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we're summing all those contributions. \n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be... Wait, actually, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(b^2a^0\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient would be zero. \n\nWait, but that's a different scenario because in the original problem, the first expansion does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has multiple terms, each of which would contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each factor. But since the second factor doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient in the second factor for \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, unless we consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 from the second factor. But that's not the case because the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the variables. The second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum the coefficients of all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAs I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check this with a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We can write this as \\(\\left[(a + b)^4\\right] \\times \\left[(c + 1/c)^6\\right]\\). \n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we calculated. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will create a term \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nWait, but that's not quite right because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, and we need to sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * (sum from k=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\)). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems consistent with my earlier reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a term in one variable doesn't affect the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient from the second part is effectively 1 for each term, but when you sum all the coefficients, it's 64. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. That makes sense because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nTherefore, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. \n\nJust to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients that sum up to 64 when \\(c = 1\\). \n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning, so I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Hmm, I'm wondering if I need to consider the expansion of this part as well. But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and since it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\), but those don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term would be multiplied by each term from the other expansion.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that can't be right because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, each term would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m\\) for some \\(m\\). But since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two separate expansions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the first expansion is multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), its coefficient in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in that polynomial is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example to see if this approach makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, I get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the second part only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) would give \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) would give \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product because the second part doesn't have a term with \\(c^0\\), except if \\(m = 3\\) in \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), but in the case of exponent 1, it's \\(\\dbinom{1}{0}c^1 + \\dbinom{1}{1}(1/c)^1\\), so no constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be zero because there's no term in the second part that would allow \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which does have a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Specifically, when \\(m = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3}(1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this. So, in the problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by the term \\(20c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would only come from the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(c^0\\), because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and thus the term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Then, multiplying by the 6 from the first part, we get 120.\n\nWait, so that makes more sense. So, the initial approach where I thought to multiply by the sum of all coefficients was incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3}(1/c)^3 = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20\\), you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, but that's only when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of coefficients, but in reality, we only need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20. So, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then I would need to consider all terms. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, i.e., their exponents must sum to zero. So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second part contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\). Therefore, only the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second part contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But that would be the case if the problem had asked for the sum of all coefficients in the entire product, but since it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which is only one term, with coefficient 20. So, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but the correct approach is to find the specific term in the second expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which is 20, and then multiply by 6 to get 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this with a different approach. Let's consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply it by a term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component. So, the only term in the second part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, applying the binomial theorem here, the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should look for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That would be the third term in the expansion, right? So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, so does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), then I need the part of the expression that doesn't change \\(c\\). So, in other words, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the term that will just be a constant, and when multiplied by 6, will give the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me focus on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). \n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides: \\(-2k = -6\\)\n\nDivide both sides by -2: \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. Let's compute that term's coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. That means when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving us a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The original problem is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we only need to consider the term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: binomial coefficients, finding the term with the required exponents, and then multiplying the coefficients together. Yep, that all checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term from this part is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the multiplication will distribute across all terms. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the coefficient from the first part and then see what happens when I multiply by the entire second expression.\n\nWait, no. That might not be correct. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and then when I multiply by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the first part is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\). However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, the \\(c\\) terms in the second part don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 multiplied by the entire second expression. But that can't be right because the second expression isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, I think I need to clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, up to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and none of the \\(c\\) terms affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a scalar. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, each term in the second part is multiplied by the corresponding term in the first part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when we multiply it by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a separate term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier, so 6 times 64 is 384. But let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose the first part is \\((a + b)^2\\) and the second part is \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the product is \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and when multiplied by the second part, which has coefficients 1 and 1, so the total coefficient would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), so multiplied by the second part, it would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) is 1, multiplied by 2, so 2. So, in this case, the coefficients are doubled because the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 2. So, in the original problem, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficients in the first part are multiplied by 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expression. But that's not quite right because the second expression is a polynomial, not a scalar. However, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's as if each term in the second expression is a scalar multiple, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of these coefficients is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when we multiply the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is straightforward; the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial expansion. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\).

Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the total coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part.

When you expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me think again. Each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (which is 64).

But actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, would indeed be the sum of all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be the same as in the first part, because the second part is being multiplied by it, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're looking for all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient, not the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply the first expansion by the second, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, it's 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, in this case, P is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term multiplied by anything to give \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, in this case, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), similarly for \\(b^2\\). But in the original problem, the exponent in the second part is 6, which is even, so maybe there's a middle term where \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so that term would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times c^{-3} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully.\n\nIn the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, no. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\).\n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. However, in my simpler example, when I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the first expansion that's being multiplied by a term in the second expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, in that case, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present at all, so the coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term. So, when I multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\), so the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my simpler example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the first expansion when multiplied by the second expansion. But in reality, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\), but there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because \\(a^2\\) is only multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not by \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero in that case.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term. So, when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64), giving 384.\n\nBut wait, in my simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because there was no \\(b^2\\) term in the first expansion. But in the original problem, the first expansion does have \\(a^2b^2\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because in the original problem, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, a^2b^2c^2, a^2b^2, a^2b^2/c^2, a^2b^2/c^4, a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which is correct? Let me clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does it mean regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or specifically when the powers of \\(c\\) are zero?\n\nIf it's regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 multiplied by 20, giving 120.\n\nBut the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, in my simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the first expansion when multiplied by the second expansion. But in the original problem, the first expansion does have \\(a^2b^2\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because sometimes in such problems, they might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the product works. The entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, each such product contributes \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), where \\(k\\) is the term from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in some cases, people might interpret the problem differently. Let me try to write out the expansion more explicitly.\n\nThe first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nThe second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, which gives \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. The problem could be interpreted as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match. So, in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and in the second part, the term where \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the answer would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The terms would be \\(ac, a/c, bc, b/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here because the first expansion is only to the first power. But if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the expansion would include terms like \\(a^2c^2, a^2c^0, a^2c^{-2}\\), and similarly for \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (which is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\) for \\(a^1b^1\\), but wait, no, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, \\(ab\\) is 2, and \\(b^2\\) is 1. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) from the first expansion with \\(b^2\\) from somewhere, but in the first expansion, there's no \\(b^2\\) term unless we're considering the product with the second expansion. Wait, no, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, \\(a^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, giving \\(a^2c^2, a^2c^0, a^2c^{-2}\\), and similarly for \\(b^2\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) would only occur if there's a term in the first expansion that has both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), which doesn't happen because each term in the first expansion has only one type of term, either \\(a^k\\) or \\(b^k\\). Therefore, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, so the coefficient would be zero.\n\nWait, that's different from the original problem because in the original problem, the first expansion is to the fourth power, which does have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after considering all these angles, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when considering all terms, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is equal to \\(a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly looking for a term in this part, but since the entire expression is a product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how the terms from each part multiply together. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the other part? \n\nHmm, maybe not. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), perhaps we can ignore the second part? That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing myself. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes both parts. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that can't be. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, when we multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expansion, so when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all the terms in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut let me think about that again. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{sum of terms} \\). When I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{each term in the second expansion}\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right either because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the question. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) should be 0 to get \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let's see. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nLet me double-check my reasoning. \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

    "text": " \n\nSo, applying that to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because it's being multiplied, not added or something else.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, since the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the expansion of the \\(c\\) part is. But that seems confusing because the \\(c\\) part would contribute to other terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in the \\(c\\) expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in the \\(c\\) expansion is just \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, and I'm only interested in the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient but a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so it must be a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let me approach it that way.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, to find the term where \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is formed by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part (coefficient 6) and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part (coefficient 20). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(something). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient has to be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, this term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6*64=384. But that contradicts the earlier result where I found 120 when considering \\(c^0\\).\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. The problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But in the context of such problems, usually, you're supposed to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when you multiply by the second factor, each term in the first factor gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first factor (6) multiplied by the entire second factor, because each term in the second factor is a separate term. But that can't be, because the product would have terms with different exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second factor, which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the only way the coefficient is a single number is if we're considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is 120, so \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That simplifies to \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I should expand both parts separately and then multiply them together? But that seems like a lot of work because each expansion has several terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, the coefficient I'm looking for is the product of the coefficients from each expansion that multiply together to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is independent of the \\(c\\) terms in the second part. \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since the \\(c\\) terms are in a separate binomial expansion, I think that when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute their coefficients as scalars when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) multiplied by \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but actually, that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then that would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because the problem is in multiple variables. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is only considering the part of the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expression from the second part, multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me think. If I expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nThen, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again. If I'm considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. That happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because the expression is in multiple variables, so perhaps the problem expects us to consider the coefficient in the context of all variables. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWhen the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's probably referring to the coefficient when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, each term is a product of a power of \\(a\\), a power of \\(b\\), and a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think I need to determine which interpretation is correct. The problem states: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the coefficient in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without specifying an exponent for \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that's not standard. Normally, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product of expressions, it's usually in the context of all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nLet me try both approaches and see which one makes sense. \n\nFirst approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSecond approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, we need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). As I found earlier, the coefficient from the second expansion for \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the more likely answer is 120, because if the problem had intended to include all powers of \\(c\\), it would have specified that it's considering the coefficient in the context of all variables, or perhaps it would have asked for the sum of coefficients. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so perhaps it's indeed 384. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, that can't be right. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think I need to check this with an example. Let's take a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get:\n\nFirst part: \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, if it had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), it would be 1, because the term \\(a^2c^0\\) is \\(a^2\\), which comes from \\(a^2 \\times 1\\), but in this case, the second part doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term, so the coefficient would be zero. Wait, no, because the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), so there's no \\(c^0\\) term. \n\nWait, so in this example, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), the answer would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if it had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), the answer would be zero because there's no such term. \n\nBut in our original problem, the second expansion is \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which does have a \\(c^0\\) term when \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps it's considering the coefficient when all variables are treated as separate, but only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are specified, leaving the \\(c\\) part to be summed over. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate and that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are in a separate expansion and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each \\(c\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of coefficients from the second expansion. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Since it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. When you have an expression like \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems to align with the first approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought that maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nI think I need to check the problem statement again. It says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Since it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), perhaps the intended answer is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate and that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of coefficients from the second expansion. So, applying that logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with another example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, we get:\n\nFirst part: \\(a + b\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together: \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 terms. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). \n\nSo, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the answer would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if considering \\(c^0\\). But given the problem statement, I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without specifying \\(c\\), so it's 384. \n\nWait, but I just realized something. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is a single term, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, which would include the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. \n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to clarify. The coefficient of a term in a polynomial is the numerical part, while the term itself includes the variables. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{2}b^{2}c^{k}\\), and the coefficient would be the scalar multiple in front of that term. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nIn that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but then in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\) would be zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion when the exponent is 1. But in our original problem, the second expansion is to the 6th power, so there is a \\(c^0\\) term. \n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think I need to decide based on the problem statement. It says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Since it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), I think it's expecting the coefficient when considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), it's 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but the problem is in multiple variables, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical value. So, if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's possible that it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1, but that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through this, and I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check once more. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"
