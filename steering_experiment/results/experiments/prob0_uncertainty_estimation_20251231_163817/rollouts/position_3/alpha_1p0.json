    "text": " Wait, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see: in the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), if \\(a\\) is squared, that means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean I have to consider both expansions multiplied together? Let me think. So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check if that has a constant term.\n\nYes, because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be constant, the exponent must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, is that all? Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part because any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or something, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, i.e., be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe I should apply that here.\n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that coefficient.\n\nThe binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2! \\cdot (4 - 2)!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I have two separate expressions multiplied together. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which I've expanded, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I notice that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part. That means when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nBut actually, hold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, when I multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at its expansion, but wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in other words, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the entire expression is a product, and we need to find the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which could have any power of \\(c\\) attached to it. But that seems complicated because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum over all the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that for each term in the expansion, we can have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and we need to sum all those coefficients. But that seems a bit more involved.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms of the form \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, right?\n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\times (1/c)^{6 - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). Therefore, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms of the form \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{2k - 6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is being multiplied by it. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense, as then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that interpretation.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the term where in \\((a + b)^4\\) we have \\(a^2b^2\\), which has coefficient 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when we multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be a different matter, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's referring to the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term.\n\nLet me double-check this approach. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{2k - 6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but only for the specific power of \\(c\\) that we're interested in.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). However, that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Suppose I didn't consider the \\(c\\) part. If I just had \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a constant, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant. But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a constant; it's a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{2k - 6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but it's possible that the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way the coefficient can be a single number is if we're considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach was correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just in the first part, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, but the coefficient would be the sum of all those products. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a Laurent polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but only considering the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a Laurent polynomial, which doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense, and the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). This is when \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's think about it differently. Suppose I have two separate polynomials multiplied together: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{2k - 6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is a sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120.\n\nWait, but that approach would be correct if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient is the sum of all those products. However, that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a Laurent polynomial, which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a Laurent polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with that interpretation.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is found by setting \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just check this with a different approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately and then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)\" for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a Laurent polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero):\n   \\[\n   2k - 6 = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

How does that factor into finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nHmm, I think since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part of the product, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the other part for the term that's multiplied by 1? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be multiplied by the constant term (if any) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let's think about that.\n\nWait, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and each of those coefficients gets multiplied by 6, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, how do we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I think about it that way, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the product would be any term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^k \\text{ in } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me confirm this with a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found, with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAnd the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're supposed to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\), or just the term where \\(c^0\\) is present?\n\nHmm, that's a bit ambiguous. In algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product of polynomials, it usually means the coefficient of the term where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have those exponents, regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But I'm not sure if that's the case because sometimes people might interpret the question as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering the term with all variables specified. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and thus the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But I'm not sure. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nWait, in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me double-check this with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nNow, multiplying them together: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it's the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which are both 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nBut according to our earlier method, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2 (since \\(c = 1\\) gives 2). So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first.\n\nSimilarly, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\), it's 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^2/c\\) is also 1, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is consistent.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, and then multiply by 6 to get 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we talk about the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, we usually consider the term with all the specified exponents. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\) would be different from the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But when the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. However, in the context of the problem, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me also compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) to see what it is, just in case the problem is intended that way.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct answer is 384, as that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now because in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 2, which was the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, by analogy, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all exponents of \\(c\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this one more time. Let me expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see what the product looks like.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). So, that would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6.\n\nWait, let me calculate that: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, since the problem asks for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\) to get \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nWait, so if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, I'm being asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire expression, there are variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, does that mean I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or is it just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's only concerned with the coefficient of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in other words, I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, maybe I just need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of the other part, but since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial multiplies each term in the other. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then it would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part, but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but that doesn't seem right because the question specifically says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should be a single number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) are in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum of terms each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part, but that would still be a sum of terms. Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) because that would be the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. Let me check that possibility.\n\nSo, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number.\n\nOkay, so let's assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nSo, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so if it's only concerned with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think my initial assumption that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is correct, and the answer is 120.\n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6. Then, I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering all variables, meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\), which would have a coefficient of 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers. So it's \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean I need to look at the expansion of both parts and find the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But wait, the other part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so when I multiply them, how does that affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms?\n\nLet me think. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative.\n\nBut when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm essentially taking every possible product of terms from each expansion. However, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I only need to consider the terms where the product contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, so each term in the final expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, a term might be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. The exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything because the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term.\n\nWait, but does that make sense? Because in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm supposed to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms that come with \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, no, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the terms where in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, it can be any term because we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have terms that are products of \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^m\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the term where \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, and then multiply it by all possible terms from the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually require that the \\(c\\) terms are also considered. Wait, no, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So perhaps I need to think differently. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo each term here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, a term could be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and then the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these out, each term in the product will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, specifically when \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, when you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So each of these terms is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from these terms. Wait, but each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient when considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient when considering all variables, but I think more likely, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me verify this. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, since \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would still be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\). That is, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. So let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require that in the first expansion, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), which has coefficient 6, and in the second expansion, we have the term where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So I'm confused now. Is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120?\n\nLet me look back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because we don't care about the \\(c\\) part. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So then the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not right because in this case, the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(k=2\\) in the expansion, but in \\((a + b)^2\\), the maximum \\(k\\) is 2, so \\(a^0b^2\\), \\(a^1b^1\\), and \\(a^2b^0\\). So there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because the expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(k=2\\) in a binomial of degree 2, which would actually be \\(a^0b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, which matches my initial thought.\n\nBut according to my earlier method, the coefficient would be zero times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is zero, so that works.\n\nWait, but let's try another example where the coefficient isn't zero. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is zero because the maximum degree is 3, and \\(a^2b^2\\) would require degree 4. So the coefficient is zero. But if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but in the problem, we're dealing with \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) is a valid term with coefficient 6, and then we multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has 7 terms. So when we multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) are those where the \\(c\\) terms are \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nIn that case, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\). So then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nHmm, now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers depending on how I interpret the problem. Let me try to clarify the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so it's ambiguous whether it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or just \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, you usually consider the term as a monomial, meaning all variables are specified. So if the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's likely referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But since it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", I think it's more likely that they want the sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial where the variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial, which has coefficient 6, and multiply it by every term from the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and think about how the coefficients combine.\n\nThe first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2.\n\nWhen you multiply these two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). The coefficient of each of these terms would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second polynomial.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component. Wait, no, that's not correct. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where the product results in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not a standard way to interpret it. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, you're referring to a specific monomial, which includes all variables. So if you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that you're supposed to consider \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term isn't a monomial but a combination with \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, making the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number. So perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense as a numerical coefficient. Let me go with that approach.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThat seems more reasonable, and it's a numerical coefficient. So perhaps I was overcomplicating it earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when \\(c = 1\\) would be 6 times 64 = 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\) and also look for \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply that the coefficient is 384, but that's when \\(c = 1\\), which might not be the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified that \\(c\\) is a variable and we're to consider terms where \\(c\\) is also present, then the coefficient would be 384. But if the problem is only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But I'm now more convinced that the intended answer is 120, considering that the problem might have meant \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But it's also possible that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is eliminated, which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually from a context where \\(c\\) is another variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered as part of the product, so the coefficient would be 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, it's 120.\n\nWait, let me consider the problem again. Since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's possible that the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me think about another approach. Let me expand both expressions and see what the coefficient looks like.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is \\(6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that's a concrete calculation. So according to this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, because each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) has a coefficient, and when you sum them all, you get 384. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But according to this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384 because it's the sum of all coefficients where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So I think that's the correct interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both expansions.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nEach term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWhen we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. We are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). \n\nWait, but I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which term would that be? Let me think. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is that the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of this part as well. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I need to find the coefficient of the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, so perhaps the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by another expression, unless there's some cancellation or combination, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is. Wait, but that might not be the case because the second part could have terms that could affect the coefficient.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in that expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is in the context of both expressions. So maybe I need to consider whether the second expression contributes any terms that would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when you set \\(c = 1\\), right? So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems high. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nWait, no, I think that's incorrect. Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial isn't just multiplied by the sum of all coefficients of the other polynomial. Instead, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and the coefficients are multiplied accordingly. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it could be affected is if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because then \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant term would still be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me work that out.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have a product of two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because any other term in the second part would introduce a power of \\(c\\) which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, 6 * 20 = 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found in the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from when the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2.

Let me think about how to approach that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, we can expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Calculating that, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since we're multiplying these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (with coefficient 6) by the constant term (with coefficient 20). There's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term in the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but I think that would complicate things more. The way I approached it seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSetting the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0, we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) to find \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, in this case, with \\(n = 4\\), the expansion would be something like \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term where \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are multiplied together. So, in the binomial expansion, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which would mean \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I think we need to consider how this term interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let me apply the binomial theorem to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we needed the constant term from the other expansion, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). If I had to pick, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both expansions, we get the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from k=0 to 4 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's see, in the expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I guess I need to consider this as well, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't matter? Or maybe the \\(c\\) terms are part of the same expression, so I have to consider the entire expansion. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, so maybe I need to multiply the coefficients from both expansions. But no, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, so their exponents don't interfere. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. But that seems a bit strange because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6, as I thought earlier. But that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from both expansions. But then, since the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), I'm confused. Maybe the answer is just 6, as I thought before.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see how they interact. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. It would be the sum from k=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for k from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in the first part. Now, when I multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I found by setting \\(c = 1\\), then 6 * 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, but that seems too simple. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, maybe that's what the problem is asking for. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's assuming that \\(c\\) is 1, or that we're considering the term where \\(c^0\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I interpret this as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the term where \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, let me try to clarify. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, say, \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P\\) would be multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(Q(c)\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's considering that \\(c\\) is 1, so \\(Q(1) = 64\\), making the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if \\(c\\) is not specified, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just 6, because \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would involve the other terms. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 384. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part is separate. But that doesn't seem right because the expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 0, because the terms are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be 0. But if I just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) as 1 and multiply by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), then the coefficient would be 2, which is not correct because in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) term. So, that suggests that my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not simply 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Instead, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 0, so the coefficient is 0, which is correct. So, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that doesn't make sense. So, maybe the intended answer is 120, considering the term where \\(c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant. But that seems too simple, and in the smaller example, that approach didn't work. So, perhaps the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Now, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is 120. So, that must be the answer.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the term where \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\). \n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\binom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the coefficients:\n- \\(\\binom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nOkay, so I see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, when I multiply these expressions together, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by every term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, actually, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term in the expansion that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a constant, but I don't think that's what we're being asked. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions together, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems more plausible.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\). But the problem statement doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute that.\n\nLet me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's simply 6, because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then all those terms would contribute, and so the total coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me consider the product of the two expansions:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\text{something}\\right) \\times \\left(\\text{something else}\\right)\n\\]\n\nEach term in the first expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), and each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when you multiply these together, each term in the product is \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\), and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). We need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that's only when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, from the second expansion, for each \\(m\\), we have \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) as the coefficient, and each term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would require that in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, we would need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second expansion when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm, I need to clarify this.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 384. But let me confirm this by considering the product.\n\nWait, but if I think about the product, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, each of these products would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), as I thought earlier. In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the rest involving \\(c\\), but without any constraints on \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when variables are multiplied, you have to consider their exponents, but in this case, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then multiply them. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, as I found. The second expansion, when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, that's 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{0}c^6 + \\binom{6}{1}c^4 + \\binom{6}{2}c^2 + \\binom{6}{3}c^0 + \\binom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\binom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\binom{6}{6}c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n1c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20c^0 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + 1c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is only for the specific term, but in this case, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any constraints on \\(c\\), it's 384. Alternatively, if it had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm once more. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the rest involving \\(c\\), but without any constraints on \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. That would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute it step by step again.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\nThen, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of all its coefficients, which is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\binom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me write that out.\n\nThe general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\), right? So if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So I think I also need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) in the second expansion won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So maybe the coefficient is indeed just 6.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check. Suppose I expand both expressions separately:\n\n1. \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n2. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean we need the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so it doesn't affect the variables.\n\nSo, in the second expansion, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let's find that. The exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\), so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nSo now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me go through it again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So the coefficient is 120. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. So multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.\n\nYeah, I think that's right. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, but the variables are different, so the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), then maybe I can just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a number, without the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but maybe it's actually considering the product as a single expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in the other, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the two polynomials are \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are different, so the only way to get a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of a term that only involves variables from the first polynomial would be that coefficient times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be [coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)] multiplied by [sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)].\n\nOkay, so first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the product of these two results, which is 6 multiplied by 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. Since the two polynomials are multiplied together, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), then every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, and its coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, since there's no overlap in variables. So, yes, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAnd the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which we already calculated as 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. The second expansion has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\), but when I set \\(c = 1\\), all those terms become 1, so the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts separately.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficients for each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\), up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\). \n\nWait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then see how they multiply together. However, since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Is that right?\n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) which has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when I multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will just get multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in other words, I'm only concerned with the part of the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from, and the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nHmm, maybe not exactly. Because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right either because the coefficients are scalars, so when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate, maybe the coefficient is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, is the coefficient just 6?\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not correct either because the coefficients don't add up like that; each term is multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify. The entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is a multiple of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we want the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all such terms?\n\nWait, no, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But I'm not entirely sure because when you multiply by another polynomial, each term's coefficient gets scaled by the entire other polynomial's terms. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems high.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the concept here. Let me try to approach it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, and thus the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. So, for example, terms like \\(a^2b^2c^3\\) would have a coefficient, and the problem is asking for the sum of all such coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit more involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). As I determined earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient when considering all variables, including \\(c\\). But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each such term is 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then maybe it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible \\(c^k\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check my reasoning. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c) would indeed be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c), but that's only if you're treating Q(c) as a scalar, which it's not. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{term}\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) equal to 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the part of the expression that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, including the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a single coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems too simplistic, and I might be missing something.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which gives terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. Each of these has a coefficient that is 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I think that's correct. Let me verify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6. But given the way the problem is phrased, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check another approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a product of two separate expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nWhen multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, perhaps I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is just a single term, and when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so perhaps each term in the product will have a term involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of the product are found by multiplying each term from the first expression by each term from the second expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and for each term in the second expansion, it will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and then when I multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second expansion will contribute a coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expressions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c^k\\) terms, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both expressions separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, let's look at the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means we're looking for all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But that's the same as \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's like considering the product where we only pick the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial where each term is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), so when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is 6 * binomial coefficient. But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of 6 * binomial(6, k). But since binomial coefficients sum up to 2^6 = 64, the total is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of a specific term in the product, not the product of coefficients. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it's just scaling the coefficient by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and we just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) it's multiplied by. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but to double-check, let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, that seems to support my earlier reasoning.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to approach this is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found, and then when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's like considering all possible \\(k\\) and summing up those coefficients. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should actually compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be the same as evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), so 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another approach where I consider the entire product and find the coefficient directly? Let me try.\n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We can write this as:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i}a^{4 - i}b^i \\right) \\times \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j} \\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two sums together, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{i}a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\\).\n\nWe are interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\). So, \\(4 - i = 2\\) implies \\(i = 2\\), and \\(b^i = b^2\\), so that's consistent. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(i = 2\\), and then it's multiplied by each term in the second sum, which has \\(c^{6 - 2j}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient for each term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2j}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}\\).\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(j\\) from 0 to 6, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}\\). That's 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAlright, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nNow, the next part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I should also expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me do that.\n\nEach term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the terms:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6 = c^6\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- When \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- When \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\), which is separate, I think the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. \n\nWait, let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the 6 from \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) in the product is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each term's coefficient adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, let me check that. Suppose I have \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\), where \\(P(a, b)\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), each term contributes its own coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that term's power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose \\(Q(c)\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. Each of these, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product isn't just 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take an example: Suppose \\(P(a, b) = a^2b^2 + 3a^3b\\) and \\(Q(c) = c + 2\\). Then, \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c) = (a^2b^2 + 3a^3b)(c + 2)\\). Expanding this gives \\(a^2b^2c + 2a^2b^2 + 3a^3bc + 6a^3b\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 2 (from \\(2a^2b^2\\)) plus any other terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in this case, the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(2a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 2. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(1 + 2 = 3\\). So, 1 times 3 is 3, but in reality, the coefficient is 2. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, my previous reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe I need a different approach. Let me think again. When I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can consider that each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that didn't hold. Let me check again. In the example, \\(P(a, b) = a^2b^2 + 3a^3b\\) and \\(Q(c) = c + 2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 3. But when I multiplied them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 2, not 3. So, that approach is incorrect. Therefore, my initial reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the example, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 3, and the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 1, so the product should have a coefficient of 3 for \\(a^2b^2\\). But in reality, when I multiplied out, I got a coefficient of 2. So, that suggests that my reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let me recast the example properly. Let me take \\(P(a, b) = a^2b^2 + 3a^3b\\) and \\(Q(c) = c + 2\\). Then, \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c) = (a^2b^2)(c) + (a^2b^2)(2) + (3a^3b)(c) + (3a^3b)(2)\\). So, that's \\(a^2b^2c + 2a^2b^2 + 3a^3bc + 6a^3b\\). Now, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I see two terms: \\(a^2b^2c\\) and \\(2a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is actually 2 + 1*c, but wait, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2c\\) has a coefficient of 1 and \\(2a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 2, but in the context of the problem, are we considering the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to consider only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any other variables? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering the entire expression, including all powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the example, that would be 1 (from \\(a^2b^2c\\)) plus 2 (from \\(2a^2b^2\\)), so the coefficient is 3, which is indeed 1 (from \\(P(a, b)\\)) times 3 (the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\)). So, my initial reasoning was correct, and perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the example.\n\nWait, in the example, when I expanded, I saw \\(a^2b^2c + 2a^2b^2\\), which are two terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 1 + 2 = 3, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) (which is 3). So, that seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the polynomial gives the sum of its coefficients. Let me compute that.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of that term in each polynomial, considering all possible ways to get that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient multiplied by 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? For example, could a term like \\(a^3b\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) result in \\(a^2b^2\\) somehow? But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by any power of \\(c\\), you can't reduce the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) would still be \\(a^3b c^k\\), which doesn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct: the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let me compute the product step by step. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient for each such product is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the coefficient of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as treating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as separate variables and \\(c\\) as another variable, and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute its coefficient multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the total is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is \\(P(1)\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we have \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then analyze the product.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nWait, in this problem, we have two parts multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied, the overall expression will be the product of the expansions of each part. So, perhaps I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only in terms of \\(c\\). So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied, not added. Wait, no, the second part is a separate expansion, so when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the two parts independently.\n\nLet me clarify: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient is a single number, not an expression. So I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expansion would contribute to different terms in the product. Wait, no, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and we don't care about the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which expands to terms like \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). So when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it will contribute \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient of term in second expansion)}\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's \\(c\\) part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, we need to sum all those contributions.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), would give a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient)} \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, let me proceed with that understanding. So first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the binomial coefficients.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term and just multiplied the entire second expansion by the coefficient from the first, I would have a coefficient that's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for the question. So, I think my approach is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Hmm, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since the product involves both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or do we need to consider \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, I think it's the former. The problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second.

So, when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're actually looking for the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when multiplied by all the terms in the second part, it would create multiple terms in the product, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a single term. So, perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in the first part, because the second part is multiplied by the entire expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of two expressions. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\cdot c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\cdot c^{-m}\\), depending on the term in the second expansion.\n\nBut when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, when we multiply this by each term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, so each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(6 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes \\(6 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we just sum all these coefficients.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all binomial coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, because when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which are all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion, which is a monomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, so it's a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient without considering other variables. So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as another variable and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, is that the answer? Wait, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two expressions multiplied together, \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is just the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the entire \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(P\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, but \\(c\\) is a variable, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. So, that would mean we need to consider the product of the two expansions and find the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the first polynomial is scaled by the entire second polynomial. So, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but if the problem is just asking for the coefficient without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, if we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, we get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would require finding the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \u00d7 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would be 384, but if it's specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) with \\(c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying any exponent for \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just 6, because the other part is multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're scaling the entire \\(a^2b^2\\) term by that expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 384. But if it's interested in the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also at a specific power, say \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be considered as two separate expansions. The first expansion has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second with \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering only the constant term, which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\), which suggests that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all these contributions, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then multiply by 6, giving 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are considered separately, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up how coefficients are defined in products of polynomials. The coefficient of a term in a product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by multiplying a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), and the first involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms from the second polynomial don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \u00d7 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. But earlier, I thought maybe it's 120, but that's when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Since the problem didn't specify, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me confirm. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider the expansion of both parts and see how they multiply together.\n\nWait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and the second part would contribute some terms involving \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't matter? Or perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second expression, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would get multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems too broad because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and multiply it by each term in the second expansion, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., when we have \\(c^0\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, so let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the combined coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion as the product of two separate expansions and find the specific term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term in the second part will just multiply it, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right because the second part isn't a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); it's in \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the second expansion is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you just get \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so you have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with coefficients and different powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then each term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times a term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 times 64, which is 384? But that contradicts my earlier answer of 120.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing two different concepts here. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we're actually looking for the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in reality, only the constant term in the second expansion (the term where \\(c^0\\)) would, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), result in a term that is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). The other terms in the second expansion involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c\\) or \\(6a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the correct coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion being 64, but that's only when \\(c = 1\\). However, in this case, we're not setting \\(c = 1\\); we're looking for the specific term where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, and multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nLet me confirm this with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1. The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the constant term is 0 because there's no term with \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 times 0, which is 0. Alternatively, if I compute the entire product: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), the terms would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no term with \\(a^2\\) alone, so the coefficient is indeed 0. So, that aligns with my earlier reasoning.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1. The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the constant term is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 times 2, which is 2. Let's check: \\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) = a c^2 + 2a + a/c^2 + b c^2 + 2b + b/c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is correct. So, in this case, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\) is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), giving 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Find the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the constant term from the second part (20):\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nWait, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So in \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. Let me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right?\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So I need to consider that as well. Hmm, how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nI think since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression, so maybe I need to include the sum of coefficients from the other part.\n\nWait, let me think differently. When you have two independent variables, the coefficients in one part don't affect the coefficients in the other. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms would just be part of the overall expression, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. Let me clarify: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Let me verify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, as when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. So the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm not sure if the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression or just the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", so it's in the product. Therefore, each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each with their coefficients. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times 1/c\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So when I multiply each term from the first expansion by each term from the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say P(a,b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a,b) multiplied by the sum of all terms in Q(c) would indeed be the coefficient from P(a,b) times the sum from Q(c). So in this case, since Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial.\n\nWait, but let me test with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\( (1 + 1)^1 = 2\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because the expansion would be \\(a^2(c + 1) + 2ab(c + 1) + b^2(c + 1)\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) is 1, and \\(a^2*1\\) is 1, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1*2. So yes, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all terms in the other polynomial. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo the expansion has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Each of these has a coefficient of 6, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all these terms would be the sum of these coefficients.\n\nBut wait, no. Actually, when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify: when I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each with their own coefficients. So the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1, for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6, for \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15, for \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 6 * 20, and so on. Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients from the second part are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term.\n\nWait, actually, no. The coefficients from the second part are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the sum over k of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6.\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."
