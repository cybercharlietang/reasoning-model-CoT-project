    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, let's focus on the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect it. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, regardless of the other part of the expression.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute terms involving \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will have a term involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not quite correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by, say, the constant term from the second part, which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, like \\(c^0\\). Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the middle term.\n\nWait, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the constant term in the second part will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. Let me check that.\n\nSo, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, if there were terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by terms in the first expansion, could result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, there's no way for the \\(c\\) terms to affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, my initial conclusion that the coefficient is 120 should be correct.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n2. Then, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20.\n3. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the reasoning about how the terms multiply is accurate. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term I want.\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficients from the two parts multiply together?\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the \\(a^2b^2\\) term interacts with the other expansion.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and multiplying by that doesn't change anything.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion where \\(c^k\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion. So, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), etc. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, the resulting terms will be \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, a^2b^2c^2, a^2b^2c^0, a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part for any term, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms, so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think differently. Since the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, as I thought earlier, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). In the first part, \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1. The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the sum of coefficients is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand the entire expression: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The terms involving \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1*(c + 1/c), which when considering coefficients, is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Expanding, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) gives \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when considering coefficients (i.e., treating \\(c\\) as a variable and looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\)), it's 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2 when considering the sum of coefficients by setting \\(c = 1\\).\n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts and see. But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, I think this approach is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in step 2. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64 because when \\(c = 1\\), it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\) because each of these terms is multiplied by 6. Let's compute that: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 +15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So, 6*64=384. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\).

So, that part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, this part has \\(c\\) terms, not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, does that mean I need to multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That suggests that the terms involving \\(c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

However, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion.

Wait, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(\\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). The term from the first expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). The term from the second expansion can be any term, say \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But that sum is 6 times the sum of binomial coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like the coefficient would be 384, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, actually, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that would be 6 * (sum of binomial coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of binomial coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which seems odd. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when the powers cancel out. Let's see: the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, so now I'm confused because I thought the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but if it's specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me look again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it might mean the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But that seems too large, and perhaps the problem expects just the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is paired with every term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm second-guessing myself because I'm not sure if the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me think about how such problems are usually phrased. Typically, if they're asking for the coefficient of a term with multiple variables, they might be considering the term where all those variables are present with specific exponents, but in this case, the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's indeed 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me double-check by actually expanding the expression. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right) + 15c^4\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + 20c^3\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + 15c^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + 6c\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Simplifying the second expansion: \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all those products. But that would mean adding up 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, each of these terms has a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then you need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second expansion, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut I'm still confused because the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\). Let me see if I can find any similar problems or recall any conventions. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, they might be referring to the coefficient of the term where all the variables in the term are present, regardless of the other variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what is intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, and not considering the second expansion at all. But that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as two separate expansions and how they combine. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number because it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\).\n\nBut that contradicts the problem statement, which is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach because the problem is likely expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the answer should be 120.\n\nTo confirm, let's break it down again:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n3. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, specifically the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense, and it's the most logical interpretation of the problem. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Using the binomial theorem, that would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms in this expansion will be:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, which is the product of two binomial expansions.\n\nNow, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire expression, we have variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms that involve \\(c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will contribute to terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we are only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because each term will multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because in the product, each term will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the sum of all coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not possible because the variables are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, so 384. But I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for each such term is 6 times the coefficient of the corresponding \\(c\\) term. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), making the coefficient the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6? Or is it only considering the constant term in \\(c\\)? I think in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term without mentioning other variables, it's usually considering the term regardless of the other variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would include all those possibilities. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), and I multiply them, then the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q(c), would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in Q. So, if we are to collect all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k, the total would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k, which is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), meaning that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which would require that the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of it differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 120 if considering only the constant term. But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), so if we set \\(c = 1\\), it's 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, times the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial, which is 1, giving 2. So, yes, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Got that part down.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think.\n\nActually, when you have a product of two expressions, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, and the second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), the multiplication by the second expression will just multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of the second expression. But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the only term that contributes is the constant term?\n\nWait, that might be it. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that will result in a term without \\(c\\) (since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms) is when the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nSo, let's tackle that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which implies \\(m = 3\\). So the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that contributes is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression. So yes, that makes sense. So the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). To find the coefficient for this term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Instead, we can just take the coefficient we found earlier and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, actually, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by the entire second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not another expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, so actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think we can treat them as separate.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\) for the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I must be misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that might make sense. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me verify. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then when multiplied by the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating all variables, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider specific terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider all possible terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor that, when considering the sum of all its coefficients (by setting \\(c = 1\\)), equals 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Hmm, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if multiplying by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, you have to consider all possible products, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would depend on the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum over all possible coefficients, which isn't the case. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the coefficients in the second expression are not being summed; instead, each term is multiplied by the corresponding term in the first expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and we sum their coefficients, treating \\(c\\) as any variable, but since \\(c\\) is present in the second part, each term in the product will have a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, that means we need to consider all possible terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a product of two separate polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check this reasoning because sometimes when variables are involved, especially with negative exponents, I might be missing something. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider expanding both expressions and see how the terms interact. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64. When I substitute \\(c = 1\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, the sum of all coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). To find the coefficient, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused about how this relates to finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does this second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or is it just multiplied by the entire expansion of the first part?\n\nLet me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by some term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent variables, so when you multiply the two expansions, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient might actually involve terms from the second expansion. Hmm, but no, because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables, so when you multiply, the variables don't mix. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, we're looking for the constant term in the second expansion multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would just be a number.\n\nLet me check that. If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider the part of the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is just the constant term. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me just verify this. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The first expansion gives me terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second gives me terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. And for the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means I need to find \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the term I'm looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does this mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to consider how this second part affects the coefficient?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to consider how the multiplication affects that term.\n\nLet me write this out more clearly. Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the entire expression is \\(P \\times Q\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(Q\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in \\(Q\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term in \\(Q\\), which involves \\(c\\), the resulting terms will have \\(c\\) in them. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero because there are no terms without \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering that \\(c\\) terms can be present as well. But no, the way the problem is phrased is \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically means the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of other variables. But in this case, \\(c\\) is another variable, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that has no \\(c\\) at all, which would mean that the coefficient is zero because every term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these are just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is zero because there's no term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd. Let me check again. Maybe I'm misapplying the binomial theorem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the entire product, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense! So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the key was realizing that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients, 6 and 20, giving 120.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n3. To find the constant term (c^0), solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means it's looking for the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

Let me clarify. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, up to \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be attached. So actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the coefficient from the second expansion is 1, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the expansion, but it would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not standard. Typically, when we talk about the coefficient of a term in a product, we consider the term in the entire expression, so if the term has \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, but I think I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So perhaps they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, collect all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. Wait, but that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiplying by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients. So let me check that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), that becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64, giving 384. So the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the term without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). Is that possible? Let me think. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require the term from the first part \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So I'm confused now. Does it mean they want the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384, or do they want the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), which is 120? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So in the product, each term is a product of terms from each factor. So \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first factor, and each term from the second factor is multiplied by it. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second factor, because each term in the second factor, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not standard. Normally, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered with all variables. So maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me think about it again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of a specific term in a product is the sum of the products of coefficients whose variables multiply to give that term. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that's not standard. Typically, the coefficient is considered in the context of all variables. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense.\n\nSo, to clarify, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, which would give 6 * 64 = 384 if we consider all coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient. So I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6, but that's a polynomial, not a coefficient. So that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm getting confused because the problem is phrased a bit ambiguously. Let me try to think of it differently. If I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, then each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms in \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms, so the coefficient would be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1*2=2, because \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1*2=2. So in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (2). So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, in my example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is indeed 2, because \\(a \\times c\\) and \\(a \\times 1/c\\) both contribute to terms with \\(a\\), so their coefficients add up. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1*1 + 1*1 = 2, which is the same as 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, applying that, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second part) = 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120. But in my example, if I had \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(ac^0\\) would be 1*1=1, because \\(a\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) which is 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(bc^0\\) would be 1*1=1. So in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 1, not 2. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because in my example, if I just asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's 2, which includes both \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\). So in that case, the coefficient is indeed 2, which is the sum of the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Therefore, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be present in all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). So each of those terms would have a coefficient, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo when we multiply these two, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6, because the problem isn't restricting the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean 6 times the sum of all binomial coefficients for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, which is 6*(2^6) = 6*64 = 384. So that aligns with my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. If I set \\(k=2\\) in the first part, then the coefficient is 6, and for each \\(m\\) in the second part, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6*64=384. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, so looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this part first. Let me write that out. The expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, that coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well.\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), because the \\(c\\) terms will contribute to other parts of the expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything because it's multiplied by that term.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the other part is in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire expression, we have terms that are products of terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^m\\) or \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{m - 1}\\) or something like that, depending on the exponents from the second part.\n\nBut since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. The exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything because the problem doesn't specify anything about them. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't the case because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I calculated before.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when asking for the coefficient of a term with specific variables, they might also specify the power of another variable if they want a constant coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then recognize that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think the first interpretation is more likely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a b\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a b\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) gives \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, multiplying these together, the term \\(2ab\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist here because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in the product, the terms are \\(a^2 c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), \\(2a^2/c^2\\), etc., so there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because it's only squared. So, perhaps my earlier approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all together, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first part as P = \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part as Q = \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product P * Q will have terms that are products of terms from P and Q. So, each term in P is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\), and each term in Q is of the form \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) = \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply P and Q, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in Q, which is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm my earlier thought.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient where \\(4 - k = 2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. However, given that the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that they want the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you have to specify all variables. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean I'm summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the most logical interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 384. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem differently. If I'm to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then it's the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(a^0b^1\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, if I follow the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given problem would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my interpretation. The correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, that must be the case. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial. Therefore, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to contradict the idea that the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's clear that \\(c\\) is part of the expression, but the term we're looking for is only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I will go with that.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, the only possible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't a numerical value. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). This occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's a red herring? Or perhaps I need to consider it in some way. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I only need to consider the part of the expression that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part can be treated as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps I can first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then just take the entire coefficient from that expansion, since it's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part.\n\nWait, but actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to expand the second part at all. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied by the entire first part, not just the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the entire coefficient from the second part will just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would actually be zero, because you can't have a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the way it's written is just \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply \\(c^0\\). Hmm, maybe I need to consider that. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient when you multiply the two expressions and collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that might not be the case because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become separate terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any \\(c\\) terms, would actually be zero because there's no term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) except when the exponents cancel out. Wait, no, the second expansion does have a constant term. Let me check that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times 6, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through it again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be when the second part contributes a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\) and thus the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically (i.e., the term without any \\(c\\)) is only from the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would involve other coefficients, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which is the constant term. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the constant term in the second expansion. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). Setting this equal to zero gives \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is when the second part contributes a constant term, as any other term would add a power of \\(c\\) and thus create a different term. Therefore, the only contribution is from the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, multiplied by 6 from the first part, giving 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem on each part separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't interact with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those will contribute to a different term in the final expansion, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would just be the product of the coefficients from each part, treating the second part as a single entity.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right either. Let me clarify: when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms in the expansion will be products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those will contribute to a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) alone (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from the constant term in the second polynomial, if it exists.\n\nWait, hold on, that's a different approach. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form (term from first part) \u00d7 (term from second part). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those will contribute to a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would require that the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, actually, the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other power of \\(c\\) would make it a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already did: it's 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the coefficients here are the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 4\\). \n\nWait, but I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in the expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). \n\nLet me compute that coefficient. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficients from the two parts are independent of each other. \n\nLet me think about that. When you multiply two expressions, the terms combine by multiplying each term from the first expression with each term from the second expression. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way the product will have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so any term from the second part will have some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\), which is \\(c^{-1}\\). But since the first part only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the multiplication will result in terms that have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to some power, and \\(c\\) raised to some power. \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that it's only interested in the part of the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. \n\nWait a second, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be part of a larger term that also includes \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, maybe we're considering the entire product and looking for terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. \n\nBut that doesn't seem right because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specifying a particular power. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the product as a whole and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but that might not make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Let me try to clarify. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the final product will be of the form \\( \\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)} \\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term and wants the coefficient of that term in the entire product, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that's not how polynomial terms work. Each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) would be a term, and \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^4\\) would be another, and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term without considering \\(c\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. \n\nWait, that might make sense. So, if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and then multiply it by each term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has its own coefficients, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified, so perhaps the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat \\(a^2b^2\\) as a single term and sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only combine with terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that can't be. The variables are separate, so when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in the first expansion because it's only up to \\(b^2\\), but if I were looking for \\(ab\\), then in the product, it would be \\(2ab \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4, because \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 2. \n\nWait, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 4, which is 2 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's expecting the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, hence 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the answer is indeed 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. \n\nSince the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that we're looking for all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm going to double-check this because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the way coefficients combine can be tricky. Let me think about how the product works. \n\nEach term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when you multiply these two, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that part is fixed. \n\nBut for the \\(c\\) part, \\(6 - 2m\\) can be any integer, depending on \\(m\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, that means we're summing over all possible \\(m\\) values. \n\nSo, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the expansion: \n\\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as: \n\\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. \n\nBut since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. This term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which are all the terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAs established earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I can use that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the second part? Hmm, maybe not. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is multiplied by that, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, perhaps the coefficient remains the same.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), then any term from the second part that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be a constant term, right? Because if there's a \\(c\\) term, then the entire expression would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we only want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part contributes a constant term 20, the overall coefficient is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 * 6 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion would involve terms from both binomials multiplied together. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only multiplied by the constant term of the second part, which is 20.\n\nSo, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can think of it as two separate expansions. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients for the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)), which is 20, then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more formally.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(k = 2\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. But we are only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), which means that the term from the second sum must be a constant term, because any term with \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^n\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^n\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, we only consider the constant term from the second sum, which is 20.\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't overlook anything, let me consider if there's any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed by multiplying terms from both expansions. For example, could a term from the first expansion with a lower power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) multiply a term from the second expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because the second expansion only has terms involving \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, any term from the second expansion is a multiple of a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply it by a term from the first expansion, it will only affect the powers of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, yes, 120 is correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where \\(k = 2\\), which is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe entire expression is the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can use that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that right? Actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that this term won't involve any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound quite right.\n\nWait, no, maybe I need to think differently. Because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and I'm looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\) terms, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), but none of these will involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) beyond what's in the first part. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense.\n\nLet me check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term must come from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term involving \\(c\\) would make the entire term have \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or similar, which wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving 120\\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that term as being multiplied by the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, let me check the expansion again. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nAnd for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by expanding both parts and looking for the coefficient. But that would be more work. Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is solid.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with 120 as the coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then, if necessary, account for any constants from the second part that might multiply it.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all the terms from both expansions. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part.\n\nSo, let me work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term.

So, I need to consider the entire expression multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the first part of the product, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the result will still have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too large.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), depending on the term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Now, when this term is multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some coefficient times \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\)). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I'm not entirely confident. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\)\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2abc + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\)\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, that's because in this case, the second expansion only has degree 1, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is degree 4 in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), there's no cross term. But in our original problem, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), but the coefficients are all present. So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but in my simple example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient remains as it is in the first expansion. But in the original problem, the second expansion is separate, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion's terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but in my simple example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. But in the original problem, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion adds a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but in my simple example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when multiplied, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is zero, which makes sense. But in the original problem, the second expansion is separate, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product term.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that's not the case. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the sum of those contributions is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Let's say the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), so sum of coefficients is 2. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 2 = 12. But let's compute the product manually:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\n\\]\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\[\n(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4)(c + 1/c)\n\\]\nWhich gives:\n\n\\[\na^4c + a^4/c + 4a^3bc + 4a^3b/c + 6a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2/c + 4ab^3c + 4ab^3/c + b^4c + b^4/c\n\\]\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is present in two terms: \\(6a^2b^2c\\) and \\(6a^2b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 + 6 = 12, which is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2). So, this seems to confirm that the method is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, where the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as I calculated earlier. And the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two independent expansions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of that term in each expansion, but in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so its coefficient in the product is just the coefficient in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're summing over all possible contributions, it's 6 * 64.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nI think I need to multiply each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we actually need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, right? Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't add any \\(c\\) terms, keeping it as \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant term from the other expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in that expansion.\n\nOkay, let's tackle \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, let's set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). Let's compute that term:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\cdot 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\cdot 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by this constant term 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion).\n\nCalculating that: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so is that the final answer? Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, we have:\n\n- The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n- The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n- Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, yes, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I can't stop here.\n\nI think I need to consider the entire product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to worry about the other terms in the second expansion because multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\) won't change the exponent of a and b. Wait, no, actually, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, the second part can contribute any term, but it won't affect the exponents of a and b. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have a's or b's, so when you multiply, the a's and b's only come from the first part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each of those terms is a power of c or 1/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients will be added together as they multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\). Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes its coefficient times 1, so the entire expression becomes the sum of the coefficients. Let me calculate that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is indeed the sum from k=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, each of those coefficients will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, regardless of the power of c. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since the second part doesn't have a's or b's, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), and since each of those has a coefficient, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part can be any term because it doesn't affect the a and b exponents. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I write out the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That gives \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have \\(m\\) ranging from 0 to 6, and each will contribute \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times the coefficient from the first part. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum from \\(m=0\\) to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it again.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: since the second part doesn't involve a or b, when you multiply, each term in the second part is just a scalar multiple, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
