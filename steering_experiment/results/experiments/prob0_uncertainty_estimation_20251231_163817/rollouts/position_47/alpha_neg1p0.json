Is there a possibility that I missed something? For example, could there be other terms in the expansion that also result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, no, because if you have a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the product would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) as well, so it wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, only the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant term would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think 120 is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1.

Is there a possibility that when multiplying the two polynomials, another combination could result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms? For example, maybe taking a term with \\(c\\) from the second polynomial and another term with \\(1/c\\) such that they cancel out. But no, because the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any term from the second polynomial would have to be \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but unless \\(k = 0\\), the term would involve \\(c\\). So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to take the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20, as calculated. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the second polynomial contributes a 1 (i.e., the constant term). So, that's 20. Thus, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient should indeed be 120. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of two polynomials. So, when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in the second polynomial that doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term. So, that's why we multiply 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) by 20 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part), giving 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, if I were to multiply out the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second polynomial, because any other term would involve \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. 3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just check the calculations again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6 because 4!/(2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6!/(3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, 6*20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem, resulting in 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, let me think again. Suppose I didn't consider the second part correctly. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only concerned with the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate.
