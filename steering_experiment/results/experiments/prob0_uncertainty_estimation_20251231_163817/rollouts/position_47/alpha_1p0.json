    "text": " Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both separately, then when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion will result in a term that doesn't have \\(c\\) in it. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero. So, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think my reasoning is correct. So, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me write that down: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, just to make sure, let me think about it another way.

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part, as any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term.

    "text": " Maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because any other term in the second expansion would have a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\), which would make the product have a term with \\(c\\) in it, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, yes, the only contribution is from the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Suppose I consider the entire expansion: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with their coefficients. Similarly, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\), each with their own coefficients. When you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we can only consider the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. Any other term in the second expansion would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would not be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think my initial reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. 2.

Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). 5. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). 6. Conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I don't see any errors in this reasoning.

Since these are two separate polynomials, when you multiply them, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.
