    "text": " Wait, wait, hold on. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (c^0) in the second expression. So, as I thought earlier, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with their coefficients. Similarly, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\), each with their coefficients. When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, a^2b^2c^2, a^2b^2 \\times 1, a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^2\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (c^0) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 120. But let me check once more to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and see if there's another way to approach it. Wait, but I think my initial approach is correct.

    "text": " Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that's correct, and the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, for the second part, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 120 is correct. I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I considered all possible contributions. Suppose I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that isn't \\(a^2b^2\\), but when multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that isn't \\(c^0\\), could that somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, any term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would not contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes. So, I think my reasoning holds. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial.

    "text": " Wait, actually, let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial. But only the term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\) will not add any \\(c\\) terms, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). If we take any other term from the second polynomial, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), then the product would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 120. But let me just check once more. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 120. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's just 120, not in terms of \\(c\\) or anything else. So, I think that's it. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we find \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
