When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

    "text": " \n\nWait, hold on, I just realized something. The original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, another thought: does the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part get multiplied by every term in the second part, or just the constant term? No, because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the entire expansion of the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, only the term where \\(k = 0\\) in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I was correct the first time. But let me think again: suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 1c^6 + 6c^5(1/c) + 15c^4(1/c)^2 + 20c^3(1/c)^3 + 15c^2(1/c)^4 + 6c(1/c)^5 + 1(1/c)^6\\). Simplifying the second expansion: \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that's correct.

But in the expansion, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).
