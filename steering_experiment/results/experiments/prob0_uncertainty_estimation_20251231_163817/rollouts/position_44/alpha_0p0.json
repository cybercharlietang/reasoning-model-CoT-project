I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap to make sure. We have two separate binomial expansions. The first one gives us a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion gives us a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term from the second expansion because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\).

The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. 2. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 3. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. 4. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. 5. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. The key was realizing that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), you only need the constant term from the second polynomial, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you'll have terms of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges such that the exponents in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be from -6 to +6 in steps of 2. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and every term in the second polynomial. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. If that's the case, then the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), because the \\(c^0\\) term is the only one that doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would actually be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering all variables. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, and that's why I thought earlier that we need to multiply the coefficients from each part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's a bit different. Because in that case, you would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and the problem probably isn't asking for that. It's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a product with terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. That would make sense, and that's what I initially thought. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think it's more likely the first interpretation. Let me see if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But in that case, it's a bit ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to clarify, when you multiply two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. However, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think the first interpretation is more likely correct because otherwise, the problem would have stated something like \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)\" or \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion\".
