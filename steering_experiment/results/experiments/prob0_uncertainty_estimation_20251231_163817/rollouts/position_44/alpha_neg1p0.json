Hmm, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with the \\(c^0\\) term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied together? For example, suppose I have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^1b^1\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's \\(c^0\\). But no, because \\(a^1b^1\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) would give \\(a^1b^1c^0\\), which is \\(ab\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, any other combination would involve either higher or lower exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, my initial conclusion seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). That's correct. So, the coefficient is 20. Then, the coefficient from the first part is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider the entire product and see if there's another way to compute it, just to confirm. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both separately and then multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I found before. Alternatively, if I consider the product as a single expression, but I don't think that would change anything. The terms are independent, so the coefficient calculation remains the same. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see if the middle term is indeed 20. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(m = 0\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\). When \\(m = 1\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\). When \\(m = 2\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\). When \\(m = 3\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Then, for \\(m = 4\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\), \\(m=5\\) is \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(m=6\\) is \\(c^{-6}\\). So, yeah, the constant term is indeed 20. So, that part is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. Hmm, but I think the approach I took is straightforward and correct. Using the binomial theorem on each part separately and then multiplying the coefficients for the respective terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.
