Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the \\(c\\) part as a separate factor. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would require multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second polynomial, which would give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we must have \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me see if I can think of another way to verify this. Alternatively, I can consider expanding both parts and looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.

Therefore, when we multiply these two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial, but only the constant term (20) will contribute to a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term we're looking for. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent.

    "text": " So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would only pair with the constant term in the second part to produce a term that's \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from each polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other term in the second polynomial that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if the second polynomial had terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when multiplied by the first polynomial, they could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, the second polynomial is only in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each polynomial if they are independent. But wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients don't just multiply directly unless the variables are completely separate. But in this case, the variables are separate: one polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, giving \\(a^4c^6 + 6a^4c^4 + 15a^4c^2 + 20a^4 + 15a^4/c^2 + 6a^4/c^4 + a^4/c^6\\). Similarly, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Now, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms, that would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), because the constant term in the second polynomial is 20. So, that gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6\\).\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20\\).\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficients multiply to give the final coefficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. In this case, since the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the only contribution comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

For example, if the first polynomial had a term with \\(a^2b^2c\\) and the second had a term with \\(1/c\\), then when multiplied, they would give \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), there are no \\(c\\) terms.

    "text": " So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake there. Let me just think again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\) (which is just 1) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
