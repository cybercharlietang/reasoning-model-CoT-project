    "text": " Maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion and see if that makes sense. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from choosing 2 a's and 2 b's from the four factors of \\((a + b)\\). The number of ways to do that is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, as I found. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when we choose 3 c's and 3 (1/c)'s, which gives c^{3} * (1/c)^3 = c^{0}. The number of ways to do that is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that specific term. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\), the exponents in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me also think about whether I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that product is a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges such that the exponent in \\(c\\) is from 6 down to -6, in steps of 2, because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have exponents that are even numbers from -6 to 6.\n\nBut we are specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product will be determined solely by that part. The exponents of \\(c\\) will be determined by the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which has coefficient 6, and multiply it by every term in the second part. However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have a \\(c\\) exponent, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) exponent. Therefore, only the constant term from the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term is 20, as we found earlier. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is the product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first binomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second binomial, but that's not exactly right. Wait, no, because the second binomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first binomial is multiplied by each term in the second binomial. But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second binomial that can contribute is the constant term, because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the product term have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've thought this through enough. The coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
