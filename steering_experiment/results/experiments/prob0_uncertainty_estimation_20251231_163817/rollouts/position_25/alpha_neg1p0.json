    "text": " So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and correctly found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and realized that to get a term without \\(c\\), I needed the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when the exponent is 0. I set up the equation correctly, found \\(m = 3\\), and calculated the binomial coefficient as 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which should be the correct coefficient. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, first, I've found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because we're looking for \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two coefficients are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)), and the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see if there's another way to think about this. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, but since we're only interested in terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that confirms that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by identifying the term where the exponent is zero.
