    "text": " Because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, without any \\(c\\) involved. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's it. But just to make sure, let me recap: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions. The first expansion gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion gives a constant term of 20. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Let me check that again. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times (c^k \\times \\text{something}) \\), the result would be a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require that the term from the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, so \\(k\\) must be zero. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second polynomial is 20. Now, going back to the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 6. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, and since they're multiplied together, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check by expanding both expressions a bit more to see if that makes sense. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. So, the middle term when m=3 is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial, but only the constant term \\(c^0\\) will result in a term without \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if the first polynomial has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second has a term \\(20c^0\\), then their product will have a term \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Let me confirm that there's no other term in the second polynomial that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by some term in the first polynomial. But since the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.

So, I think that's the answer.

In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the term from the first polynomial that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second polynomial that is \\(c^0\\), and then multiply their coefficients. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if I were to expand both expressions fully and then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), because any other term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k = 0\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients for 4 choose 2 is 6, and 6 choose 3 is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120.

So, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then multiply it by, say, \\(c^3\\) from the second part, that would give me a term \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which isn't what we want. But if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), then I get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so that's the term we want. So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap: The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct, but let me double-check. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product and see if the terms combine as I thought. Let me write out the expansions a bit more explicitly. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5*(1/c) + 15c^4*(1/c)^2 + 20c^3*(1/c)^3 + 15c^2*(1/c)^4 + 6c*(1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is indeed 20.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through each step again. First, \\((a + b)^4\\): we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct.

But wait, let me think again: when you multiply the two expressions, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. So, the product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion as a product, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other.

So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and see if I can find the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when you multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to take the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve any \\(c\\) terms, we only consider the term in the second polynomial that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as I found before. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because any other term in the second polynomial would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, that's why we only consider the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that seems correct.\n\nLet me just verify the binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: could there be any other terms in the expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if there were a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that was \\(c^0\\), which we have, but is there any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? I don't think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their exponents are independent. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that since the two polynomials are in different variables, their multiplication doesn't affect each other's exponents.

When you expand this, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion.

Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Suppose I don't separate the two parts.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply by the entire second part? No, that can't be right because then we'd have an expression involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion would multiply each term in the first. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in the first expansion is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in the second is a monomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are products of monomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times any term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not right because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficients 6 times the coefficients from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that seems different from what I thought earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, that's not right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in reality, only the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c^k\\) term, making the entire product term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that brings me back to my initial thought: the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion to see if that's different. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. But that's not the same as the constant term. The constant term is 20, as we calculated earlier. So, if I were to take 6 times 64, that would be 384, which is different from 120. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since it's specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that's only the constant term. So, I think my initial approach was correct: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion as a product and then collect like terms. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) with each term in the second expansion. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), giving 120a^2b^2? Yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), that would be different. Then, we would multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the term with \\(c^2\\), which has a coefficient of 15, giving 90 as the coefficient. But in our case, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so we only consider the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check my calculation of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, yes, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer should be 120, which in LaTeX is \\boxed{120}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe set the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of the constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think again. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, let's compute that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which happens at m=3, and the coefficient is indeed 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial. Because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product term have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me check that again. Because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second part. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) but no \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that from the second expansion, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that term would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product with coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

But that seems too large, and I think I might be making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\).

So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion comes from the 6 coefficient, as we found. Then, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) to some power, making it a different term. So, only when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) do we get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. As we found earlier, \\(k = 3\\) gives \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.

    "text": " Because when you multiply the two, the \\(c\\) terms would cancel out if it's the constant term. Let me think again: if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will only combine with the term that has \\(c^0\\) in the second part to give a term without \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? No, because any term from the second polynomial that's not the constant term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, so only the constant term would multiply with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " Let me verify that. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial, you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), which would have a \\(c\\) term unless \\(k = 0\\). So, only the constant term from the second polynomial will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\).

    "text": " Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in.

I think that's correct. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this, maybe by expanding both parts separately and then looking for the term. But that might be more complicated.
