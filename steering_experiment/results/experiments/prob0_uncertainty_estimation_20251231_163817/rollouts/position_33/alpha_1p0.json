So, I considered that when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. That makes sense because if I take any term from the second expansion that's not constant, it would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would affect the term we're looking for. So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product and see if there's another way to approach it. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). When you multiply these two, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, the exponent of \\(c\\) must be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} a^2b^2c^0 = 6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that confirms it. The coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's correct.

First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct.

We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) and 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the relevant coefficients from each part of the product and multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent is 0. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the two variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
