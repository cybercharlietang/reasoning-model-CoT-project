    "text": " We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my reasoning. So, the key idea is that when multiplying two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial. That makes sense because any other term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, but since we're only interested in the term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the entire expansion. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. However, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems solid. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that all? Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed 6. In the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, yeah, that should be the coefficient. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
