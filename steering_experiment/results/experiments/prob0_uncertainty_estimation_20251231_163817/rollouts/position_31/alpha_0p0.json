Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply if the variables' exponents don't interfere. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, yes, multiplying their coefficients gives the correct result. I think that's right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes when dealing with multiple variables, it's easy to overlook something. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part must contribute \\(c^0\\), the only term that matters is the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20, which is 120. So, I think my initial conclusion was correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first binomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second binomial. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed. But since each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a product of a power of \\(a\\) and a power of \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a power of \\(c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term. So, no other terms can contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing a \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

Therefore, I was correct to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for cross terms, but I think the method I used is solid. Alternatively, if I were to expand both expressions completely, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come only from multiplying the corresponding term in each expansion, specifically the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part.

    "text": " The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - We need the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. 2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of the constant term (c^0) as 20. 3. Multiplied these two coefficients together to get 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, I'm confident that 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).
