    "text": " Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient. But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, maybe I don't need to consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but rather, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their expansion will contribute terms that are multiplied by the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the terms \\(a^2b^2\\) and the terms from the second part won't interfere with each other in terms of exponents. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it? Hmm, maybe. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me try to clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, multiplied by whatever comes from the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as another variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms will be products of the terms from each expansion. So, for example, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and then I multiply it by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6? Because each term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6 a^2b^2\\). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient, not the term. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just the binomial coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in any polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is \\(P(1)\\), which in this case is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients of the second part). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nNow, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). That would correspond to when the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is multiplied by another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think I need to consider how this multiplication works. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients in the first part (\\((a + b)^4\\)) and the second part (\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) are independent of each other. \n\nLet me think about it. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me correct myself. Actually, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will remain as they are, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-examine the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, find the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, that seems possible. Let me think again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another binomial expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\). It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are just numbers. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't possible because coefficients are scalars. \n\nHmm, I must be missing something. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThe sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be because the coefficient should be a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by different variables. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and then multiply it by 6. \n\nSo, let's compute that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut I'm confused because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying \\(c\\), then it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when a term is specified without other variables, it's implied that we're considering the coefficient regardless of the other variables, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum over all those terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by different variables. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. \n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut wait, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the individual polynomials. However, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, so it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nSo, sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut then, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would make sense. So, perhaps the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear. Wait, that's a bad example. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The product is \\(a(c + 1) + b(c + 1) = ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times (c + 1), which is a polynomial, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's (c + 1). But coefficients are usually scalars, so perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products. \n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, for example, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product, it would be the sum over all m and n such that the exponents add up to the desired exponents. \n\nBut in this case, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k. That would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. \n\nBut the problem statement is ambiguous. However, in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term that includes some variables but not others, it's implying that the other variables can be anything, i.e., the coefficient is a polynomial in those variables. But in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's intended to be a scalar, meaning that we're considering the coefficient when the other variables are set to 1 or something. \n\nWait, no, that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by different variables. \n\nBut that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut I'm still unsure. Let me think of another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut that sum is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since the sum of binomial coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because if we're considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it's a bit non-standard. But given the problem statement, I think this is the correct approach. So, the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if considering \\(c^0\\). Let me confirm. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since it's not specified, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nBut to be safe, perhaps I should consider both interpretations. However, given that the problem includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)\", then it would have specified \\(k\\). Since it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through this. Based on the problem statement, I'll conclude that the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nYes, that makes more sense. Because if you're only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to compute the entire product and see. \n\nWait, that's not feasible because it's a lot of terms, but perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if considering only \\(c^0\\), it's 20, giving 120. \n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nBut to be precise, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try to think of it as a generating function. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\) from the first part and all terms from the second part. But since the first part only has \\(a^2b^2\\) once, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut wait, no. Wait, in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar, so perhaps it's only considering the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 6*20=120. \n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying any power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0th power in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see what value of \\(k\\) gives me that term. Since the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\( \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6 \\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nOkay, so now I know that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. \n\nWait, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply with every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything because multiplying by any term in the second expansion won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second polynomial. \n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're looking for the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion isn't just a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I think the problem is only focusing on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the answer is just 6. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. But when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me verify. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables. But that would require looking at each term and seeing if it's \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term, but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps the answer is indeed 384. \n\nWait, but let me approach this differently. Let's consider the entire expansion of both parts. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we're looking to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total contribution is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute the product of the coefficients from each part for that specific \\(k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion again. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Suppose I don't consider the second expansion's sum of coefficients, but instead, consider that each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we sum all these contributions, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). And since \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. That means I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms from each will multiply together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all variables, but that would require knowing the power of \\(c\\) as well, which isn't specified. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients of the second polynomial. So, if you have \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm treating the second polynomial as a single term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient, which is a numerical value, perhaps we're supposed to consider the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by expanding the second polynomial. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64, and therefore the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would result in a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6, and the second part would just multiply each term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems contradictory to my earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a numerical value, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Given that the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by calculating it another way. Let's say I expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As we saw earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the product, this term is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by each term's coefficient in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering the entire product, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but to double-check, let's compute the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- For \\(c^6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- For \\(c^4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- For \\(c^2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- For \\(c^0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- For \\(c^{-2}\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- For \\(c^{-4}\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- For \\(c^{-6}\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nAdding these coefficients: 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is 64, so the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts together. Let me think about how that affects the coefficient. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, I don't think the second part affects the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part only deals with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering any powers of \\(c\\), I think I might have misunderstood something. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes the product of both expansions. But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, you're combining terms, so maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just a constant coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that any term that includes \\(c\\) wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\), it would have an extra \\(c^k\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms is if the second part contributes a term where \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term. So, actually, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from the first part.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

So, in the expansion, when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of that as well. Let me think: since the expression is a product of two expansions, the total expansion will be the product of each term from the first expansion and each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because those are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of what happens in the second part? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part might affect the overall term when multiplied.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a separate polynomial, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second expansion, it's like multiplying each term by the entire second polynomial, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just have the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second expansion don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second part can be anything, but they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a separate variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is the product of two separate binomial expansions. The variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables. Therefore, when I expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives me the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(c + 1/c\\) raised to the 6th power, I need to consider how it affects the term. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are independent, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and it will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as I thought before, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient in the product, considering all possible terms, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't make sense because each part is a separate binomial expansion. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with coefficient 6, and a term from the second part with coefficient, say, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), then the combined coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible \\(m\\), which would give 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as before, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that's not possible because every term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is indeed 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. So, this seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding this, the term \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0}a^2b^0 \\times \\left(c^2 + 2c \\times 1/c + (1/c)^2\\right)\\), which is \\(1 \\times a^2 \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 4. So, indeed, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 4, which is 1 times 4. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), which is 2 times 4, giving 8. So, this approach seems to hold. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product will have the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, in effect, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients in this second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would mean I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) will give me \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nNo, actually, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the \\(c\\) terms would multiply the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would have to multiply to 1, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\)s, so the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me break this down. First, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion. Let me think differently. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the second expansion's terms must contribute a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is the \\(c^0\\) term, as I thought earlier. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let's expand both expressions separately and then multiply them, but I think that's going to be more complicated. Alternatively, I can think about the multinomial theorem, but I think the binomial approach is sufficient here.\n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20 from the second part, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me see, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this with \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. So, does that mean the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the entire term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try again. \n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should just be a number, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\), but the way it's phrased is just \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire expression, including the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum over all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make more sense. So, let me try that approach. \n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nOkay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other part is 20, so when we multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, leading to 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product directly. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, so which is it? \n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing two different concepts. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. So, it would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, leading to 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But since it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression, including all powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me confirm this by expanding both parts. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). The constant term here is 20. \n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), I'm confused. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't possible because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check online or with a friend to see if I'm overcomplicating this. Oh, wait, I can't do that right now. Let me think again. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, another way: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part. But since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense, so I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me check my calculations again. \n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n2. Constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so it's not a single coefficient. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product.

That means, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the part of the expression that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest can be multiplied by any terms from the second part, but since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficients from the second part will just be multiplied by 6. Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the result will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. Wait, but actually, when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will produce a term like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). So, if the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The question is asking specifically for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that term will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, that means I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by this constant term, I get 6 times that constant term times \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the original question just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that they are considering \\(c^0\\) implicitly, so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The original problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, as I thought earlier, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which again doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check my steps again. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply them together to get 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I don't think this part affects the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), because it's only dealing with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. No, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the expanded form, there will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of each such term would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, but in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that combine to form that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying a particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the sum of all coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me check that possibility. If that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the problem is asking for the constant term in \\(c\\) or the sum over all \\(c\\) terms. The problem statement says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term regardless of \\(c\\)'s power. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Wait, but let me check again. If I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Let me think about how the problem is phrased: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Now, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The term \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so maybe their coefficients don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think about that. When you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial.

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can consider the sum over all terms in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part would contribute to different terms in the product. Actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first polynomial and the second polynomial is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second polynomial and how they affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{2k - 6}\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check if I'm understanding the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second polynomial, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we're effectively summing over all possible terms in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes to a term in the product that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Is that the case? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other polynomial involves \\(c\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to consider all possible \\(c^k\\) terms, which means summing over all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term not involving the variables of the second polynomial is the product of the coefficient from the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial.

When you have two separate products, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, that would only be the coefficient if we're specifically looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), it just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me check again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering the entire expansion. But in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume that it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). If I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the product, the highest power of \\(a\\) is 2, and the highest power of \\(b\\) is 2, but in reality, each term would be \\(a^kb^{2 - k}c^m + a^kb^{2 - k}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 0\\), which is 2ab * something, but wait, no, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(b^2a^0\\). Wait, maybe my example isn't the best.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, it becomes 6\\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTo find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit uncertain because I thought maybe the problem was asking for the coefficient when considering specific powers of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think the correct approach is to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), making the coefficient 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering the entire sum over all \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6, but that seems incorrect because the other part does contribute to the coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so that would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when \\(c\\) is raised to any power, doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate polynomial.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied by the first part, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6, but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 times 2. So, applying that logic, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is correct because \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c\\) is 1 * 1 = 1, and similarly for other terms, but if we're just considering the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), which is \\(a(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient is 1 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of coefficients, which is 2. Therefore, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, the result is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, for each term, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the coefficients in the first part don't directly affect the coefficients in the second part. That is, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and any term from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the coefficient of any term in the second part, but wait, that's not quite right. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two separate expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in each expansion are independent of each other. So, when I multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is a separate term involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the answer is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product of the two expansions, the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared will be multiplied by terms from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and multiply them by the coefficient from the first part, but that would give us a sum of coefficients, not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so we have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has multiple terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but that would still require considering all possible terms, which seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. However, that's not correct because the second expansion is a separate polynomial, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of all terms in this expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and each term in the second expansion is multiplied by this 6. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this approach. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by each of these coefficients, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing all these coefficients together. So, 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to be careful about how they interact, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables, the coefficients multiply as I thought. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me compute the second expansion separately. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), and then it mirrors: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this the correct interpretation? Because sometimes, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's more like the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient for each such term is 6 times the coefficient from the second expression. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean summing all those coefficients, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes in such problems, the variables are treated as separate, and the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients, but in this case, since we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), it's more like the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and then multiplying it by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the arithmetic: 6 + 36 is 42, plus 90 is 132, plus 120 is 252, plus 90 is 342, plus 36 is 378, plus 6 is 384. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, since each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That's consistent.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it through multiple methods: calculating the sum term by term, using the sum of coefficients by substituting \\(c = 1\\), and multiplying by the coefficient from the first part. All approaches lead to 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in this second expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a numerical factor, and the other part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms that are products of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the expansion, and it would be multiplied by some combination of powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the sum of all the coefficients from the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(c^k\\) for \\(k\\) from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. \n\nBut wait, no, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 3k}\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no. The general term in the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for each \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). So, the exponents go from \\(6\\) (when \\(k=0\\)) down to \\(-6\\) (when \\(k=6\\)), in steps of 2. So, the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. \n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in other words, we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Because the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which would be when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nWe already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n2. Expand \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. \n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the right answer. Let me just double-check the calculations. \n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct because 4 choose 2 is 6. \n\nSecond, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Yes, because 6 choose 3 is 20. \n\nMultiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the part of the expression involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and that the coefficient is then multiplied by the constant term from the other part, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. But since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve the other variables, we only need the constant term from the second polynomial. \n\nSo, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, from this, I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, I think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is going to be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that any term from the second expansion will just multiply the entire first part, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just get multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the entire expression would have that 6 multiplied by the expansion of the second part. But then, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, no, because the coefficients in the second expansion are for different terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will multiply the 6, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion is 6 times the coefficient of that term. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient in the second expansion for \\(c^k\\) and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we sum all coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first polynomial, and we're multiplying by all terms from the second polynomial, which involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAnother way to see it: Let\u2019s denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) will have terms formed by multiplying each term in \\(A\\) by each term in \\(B\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When we multiply this by each term in \\(B\\), which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), the coefficient for each such term would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, so the total coefficient is 6 * \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since this term is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But that doesn't seem right because then it would be a product, not a combination. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two binomials. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the expansion, and we need its coefficient. However, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

But that can't be right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again.

But actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, perhaps the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) is if it's multiplied by the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be present in the product if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1.

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in the second expansion, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. So, it's just 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nI think I might have confused myself initially by thinking that maybe the \\(c\\) terms could affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but since they are separate variables, their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient remains the product of the individual coefficients from each expansion. So, yeah, I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each binomial expansion. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which would mean \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's independent of them. That means when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I just need to multiply the coefficient I found in the first part by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms from the second expansion that involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, it's like taking each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, since we're looking for a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's just adding more terms, but actually, when you multiply by the second expansion, you're creating terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the 6 I found earlier? Wait, no. Because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But actually, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two separate products, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part contributes a factor of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and realized that since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the entire expansion of the second part is just a scalar multiple. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's separate. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that might not be quite right. Let me clarify. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion is a multiple of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will just carry over the coefficient. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to collect all the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, we need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) => \\(2k = 6\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the only term in the second expansion that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Now, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). That's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is 20. So, when we multiply these two, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that makes sense. So, I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. The key was realizing that in the second expansion, only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because all other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the final coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct, the only term in the product that will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. However, since the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we are considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to exist in the product, it must come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the second part is just a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first and a term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc., but the coefficient for each of these will be the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because in the product, each term has specific exponents for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the term; the full term would include some power of \\(c\\) as well. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, which would effectively mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum of terms, not a single term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all in the term we're looking for, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is actually the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, first, let's find the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's fixed. Then, the coefficient for each such term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, each contributing \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient. So, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so indeed, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the term would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. In that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), since to get \\(c^0\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let's consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients, which would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a term involving \\(c\\), not a constant. Alternatively, if we set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, but that's not the same as the coefficient in the original expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with a constant coefficient, which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it would be 384, but that seems less likely because usually, when asking for a coefficient in such a product, they specify the variables involved.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended meaning is that we're considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part is a sum, the total coefficient would be the sum of the products.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a constant.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it creates terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering all such terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't possible because coefficients are constants.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem just says \"coefficient\", which usually refers to a constant. Therefore, perhaps the intended meaning is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that would result in 384, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me try to think of another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then multiply them.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found before.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That is, 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems to contradict the earlier thought where I considered \\(c^0\\). So, which is correct? I think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the answer is 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, but multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a single coefficient, which suggests that perhaps we're supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are typically constants.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we're summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by their respective coefficients from the second expansion. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from the wording of the problem. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, given that the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, it's more likely that the intended answer is 120, as that would correspond to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), making it a constant term.\n\nWait, but let's see what happens if I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient becomes 384, which suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing over all coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider the multinomial theorem. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us the terms for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us terms for \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply these two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"
