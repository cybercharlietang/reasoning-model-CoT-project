    "text": " Let me compute each term. When k=0: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\). When k=1: \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\). When k=2: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). When k=3: \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\). When k=4: \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\). So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Okay, so I see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. So, the entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one in a and b, and another in c and 1/c. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider how this term interacts with the other expansion. But wait, hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of c and 1/c. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means we need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part is in terms of c and 1/c, which are different variables, those terms won't affect the a and b exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a separate polynomial. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be present in the product as \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that might not be correct because the second expansion is in terms of c and 1/c, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that seems too much. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second expansion doesn't affect the a and b terms, the coefficient remains 6, and the rest is about c terms which are separate. But that doesn't seem right either because the entire expression is a product, so the a^2b^2 term is multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. So, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, I can substitute c = 1. So, substituting c = 1, we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When we multiply this by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^k, where k varies. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each contributing a different power of c. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe that's correct. Let me check my reasoning again. The first expansion gives me \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2(1/c^6)\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I found earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in c, not a scalar. So, perhaps the correct way is to realize that when you multiply by the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1.

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, that would be when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(n = 4\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. Let's do that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, I'm essentially multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the terms involving c, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve c. So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the ways that when I multiply a term from the first expansion with a term from the second expansion, the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, I think I can consider the coefficient as the product of the coefficients from each expansion, because the terms involving c will just contribute a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but the point is, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about c, maybe it just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating c as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial gives the coefficient for that term in the product. So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Is that correct? Let me check. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting c = 1. So, substituting c = 1, we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that accurate? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of that term in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in a and b, and the second is in c and 1/c. So, the terms don't interfere with each other. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, it's actually the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of c, then I would have to find the corresponding coefficient in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, the answer is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you distribute, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. And the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, which gives 2^6 = 64, as I did earlier. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, if I were to think of it as combining the two expansions, but since they're separate variables, the coefficients multiply when considering the same term.

    "text": " Wait, so the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 4. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let me set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this mean I need to consider the entire expression? Or is the question only about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means I need to consider the expansion of both parts and see how \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the other part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's sufficient to consider just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire product, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^n\\) where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then, since the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, perhaps the question is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which again, is not a constant. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because to get \\(c^0\\), you need to choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems too simplistic. Let me try to approach it more carefully. Let's denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The product is \\(P \\times Q\\). When you expand \\(P\\), you get terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Similarly, when you expand \\(Q\\), you get terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} (1/c)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). Now, when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in \\(P\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from \\(P\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, when we multiply this term by each term in \\(Q\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\) will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, that's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is \\(6 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\), then multiply them together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because to get \\(c^0\\), you need to choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms, so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But to be sure, let me check. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(Q\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a specific number, not a large one. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives me terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives me terms involving \\(c\\). When I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I think I need to clarify what the problem is asking. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and not worrying about \\(c\\), so the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but not specifying any power for \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a term, not a coefficient. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that's not a number. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to look for another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(k = 2m - 6\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms my earlier thought. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because I might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, if the problem is only about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is just 6, but that seems too simple, and the presence of \\(c\\) in the expression suggests that it's part of the problem. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384. But wait, let me check again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to make sense. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, in the entire expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem was to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a number. So, in that case, the coefficient is not a number but a polynomial. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Therefore, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. So, let's try that approach. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the number of ways to choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, maybe the problem is asking for that. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify. If the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure. However, in standard problems like this, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term involving some variables but not others, it's usually considering the term with those variables and the other variables raised to zero. So, in this case, it's likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of another approach. Let's consider the multinomial expansion. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part can be multiplied by it. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's safer to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 384. However, I'm still a bit confused because in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 384. Alternatively, if it's considering \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384. But I'm not entirely certain. To resolve this, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\) will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of another way. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then, the product becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute \\(1^2 \\times 1^2 = 1\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, when I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the total value is 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. The value contributed by \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is the coefficient we're looking for. Therefore, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). So, which one is correct? I think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut to confirm, let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a number. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, it must be considering a specific term, such as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, it's 6 times the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is presented as asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\), which is a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nBut to make sure, let me check with another approach. Let's compute the product step by step. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, depending on the interpretation, the answer could be either 384 (if considering all coefficients) or 120 (if considering only the constant term). Since the problem didn't specify, but in standard problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term involving some variables, it's usually considering the term with those variables and the others set to zero. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, in the expansion I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial, which includes all the terms multiplied by 6. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 384 when considering the sum of all coefficients. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Therefore, I think the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nBut to make sure, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, in the expansion, the coefficient is a polynomial, so it's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Given that, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we also need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(n = 4\\), so yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\); it's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, because when you multiply by the other part, it's just a constant factor? Wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, actually, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will have multiple terms, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by whatever term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is a product of terms involving \\(c\\), the overall term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term in the second expansion)}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the term in the second expansion must be a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if it's not zero, then the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and thus the entire term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply those together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me just double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does the second part affect that? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is another binomial expansion, and it would contribute terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when you multiply them together, 6*20=120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(n - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the second part contributes a constant factor? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we need to consider the entire coefficient from the second part as well. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\text{sum of all terms in the second expansion}\\). But that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a single term. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying by all possible terms from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term from the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me see. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, so which is it? 384 or 120? I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, each term in the product is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and to get a term without any \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply, any term from the first expansion that doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\) won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in one term of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like a lot. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the other part is 1, meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, you get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term, right? Because when you have even exponents, the middle term is the constant term.\n\nSo, let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, which equals 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only when their variables don't interfere. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is \\(c^0\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me just verify this with another approach. Alternatively, I can consider the entire expansion of both parts and then multiply them, but that would be tedious. Alternatively, I can think of the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because when k is 2, the exponent on b is 2, and the exponent on a would be 4 - 2 = 2. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression I have is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider how the terms from the second expression affect the exponents of a and b. Because when I multiply, the exponents of a and b will only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the exponents of c and 1/c will come from the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and when you multiply by the entire second part, each term from the second part would add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for a specific term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when c = 1, which would make each term just the binomial coefficient. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is equal to \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when multiplied by the entire second expression, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me try a different way. Maybe I should consider that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will still be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), but multiplied by some power of c. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in other words, all the terms in the expansion where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of what the exponents of c are. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, as I thought earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this because I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first factor, and the second factor doesn't affect the exponents of a and b, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, actually, that's not the case. The coefficients multiply only when you're considering specific terms that combine to give a specific product. But in this case, since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression, which would make it 6 * (sum of coefficients of the second expression). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is indeed 64, as calculated before. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expression, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the c terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific c term, like \\(c^0\\) or something, then it would be different. Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any c terms. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the exponents of c. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6, and the second part doesn't affect it, but that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second expansion, but when collecting like terms for \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, I think the correct answer is 384. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by c^0, which would be the constant term in the second expansion. If that's the case, then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponents of c cancel out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of c to be 0, so 6 - 2k = 0, which gives k = 3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not specifying any c terms, so I'm not sure. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. If it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any c terms, so perhaps it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any c term, but I think the standard interpretation would be that the coefficient is for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so 384. But let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the same as the coefficient in the original polynomial, because the other polynomial's terms are multiplied by it. Wait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the original polynomials. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some c term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. Since the problem doesn't specify the c term, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so the answer would be 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the specific term where the exponents are exactly as given, without considering other variables. But in this case, since the variables a, b, c are all separate, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, leading to 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But let me just verify the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when c = 1, so it's (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, so the expansion would be \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6, right? Because it's the middle term when expanded. So, that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a scalar multiple, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (if any) from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is also a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it might have a constant term. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes more sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\) on \\(c\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because of the binomial coefficients: 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So that's correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is as I did before, and the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way this could be approached. Another approach might be to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided the variables match appropriately. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's exactly what I did. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, that's why we needed to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, that's why we multiply 6 by 20 to get 120. So, that's consistent with what I thought before.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I were to write this out as a product, it's like \\( [ \\text{something with } a \\text{ and } b ] \\times [ \\text{something with } c ] \\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, that's exactly what I did, so I think that's correct.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients, let me verify:\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That's correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider another angle. Suppose I didn't separate the two parts and tried to multiply them together. Would that give me the same result? Well, it's a bit more complicated, but let's see. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to expand both parts fully, the product would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are such that \\(m + n = 6\\) in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore all terms that don't have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would only be the term where \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, giving \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, the term where \\(c^m (1/c)^n\\) is a constant, which as we saw is when \\(m = n = 3\\), giving \\(c^3 \\times c^{-3} = c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from the constant term), which is 120. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the product in another way. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the product step by step. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) is as we've expanded, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is also expanded. So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way it can contribute to a term without \\(c\\) (i.e., a constant term) is if it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, that's why we only need the constant term from the second part, which is 20, and then multiply by 6, giving 120. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think in terms of generating functions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each factor, but only if the other factor contributes a constant term. Otherwise, it's more complicated. But in this case, since the second factor contributes a constant term, that's the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, another way to check: Let me compute the entire expression for a specific value of \\(c\\), say \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that's not correct because when \\(c = 1\\), the second part is 64, but in reality, the constant term is 20, so the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, this suggests that my previous approach is correct because when \\(c = 1\\), the second part is 64, but that's not the constant term. So, that approach might not be the best way to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider specific values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to test. Let me pick \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^4 \\times 2^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). On the other hand, if I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(1^2 \\times 1^2\\) plus other terms, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, since when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the value is 1024, which should also be equal to the sum of all coefficients in the expansion. But that might not directly help me with the specific coefficient I'm looking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and look for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that's a bit tedious, so maybe I can think of it as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) with each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20. All other terms would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me see if I can compute it another way. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two generating functions. The first generating function is for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is for \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but only if the second part is a generating function that includes all terms. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not a generating function that sums over all powers of \\(c\\). Instead, it's a finite polynomial. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can be present in the product without any \\(c\\) terms is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part with the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I've checked it enough ways, and all approaches lead to the same answer: 120. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n   \\]\n   Simplifying each term:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. Does that mean the second part doesn't affect it? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\).

Then, I need to compute the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? I think you can find it by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64.

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, so when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6, but each term is multiplied by a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term.

That makes sense because any other term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), we get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) a coefficient of 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the constant term as 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, so for each term, the exponents of a and b add up to 4. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That would correspond to when \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so in the expansion, that's when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, n is 4, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies k = 2. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, since the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves c and 1/c, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, I think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, that would mean that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something that has c terms, then the resulting term would have c terms as well, but I just want \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the c terms must cancel out, meaning their exponents must be zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponent of c is zero, because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? For example, suppose in \\((a + b)^4\\) I have a term like \\(a^3b\\), and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) I have a term with c^0, but that would still result in \\(a^3b\\) times 1, which doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Similarly, other terms would result in different combinations of a and b, so I don't think any other terms would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my calculation is correct.

Hmm, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to expand the second part because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only looking for terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a factor that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part might just contribute a constant factor. Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part)? So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the other part could have terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the terms with \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and I should just take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me think again. Let me write out the product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\\). Simplifying the second sum: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the second sum is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply these two sums together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first sum, \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\), as before, with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, when I multiply this by the second sum, which has terms involving \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) term, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6 because the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest is multiplied by other terms, but that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Wait, but looking back, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, as calculated before. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, but perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only if the terms involving c and 1/c don't affect the a and b terms.

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expansion for the term that doesn't involve a or b. Wait, no, because the second part is in terms of c, so maybe the a and b terms are independent of c. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because then it would just be 6 times something. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with c, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the a and b terms. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c or 1/c, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving c. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when you have a product of two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiplying it by every term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that any term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving c, the resulting terms would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the constant term in a binomial expansion? I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of c is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k: \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so k=3, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, that corresponds to k=2 in the first part, giving us 6a^2b^2. Then, in the second part, we need the term where the exponent of c is zero, which is when m=3, giving us 20. So, when multiplied together, it's 6 * 20 = 120a^2b^2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).

    "text": " Wait, but I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would be when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(n = 4\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts? Hmm, I think so. Because the entire expression is the product of these two binomials raised to powers, so when you multiply them out, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part, because when you multiply, any term from the second expansion will just tag along with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first. Wait, but actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating all variables as separate. So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check again: the problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that when you multiply out the entire expression, you get terms that are products of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part would contribute a factor that multiplies it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Wait, but no, that's not correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is separate. So, actually, the entire expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\), but since \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^m = c^{k - m}\\), which is a separate term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, maybe the problem is considering the product of the two expressions and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. So, that would involve two parts: first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, if I consider the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m(1/c)^n\\), but we're only interested in the term where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely, as the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a single number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since \\(n = 4\\) here. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

So, I need to consider both parts. Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms from each will multiply each other. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it's only affected by the part from \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply the two expressions, every term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that can happen is if I take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so that term would just be 1, and multiplying by it wouldn't change anything. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and in the second expansion, the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is 20. So, when you multiply those two terms together, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nIs there any other way this could go wrong? Maybe if I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. Let me check \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4 choose 2 is indeed 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is correct.

Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times each of those coefficients. But actually, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply by, say, \\(k c^m\\) from the second part, then the term would be \\(6k a^2b^2 c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6, and when you collect all the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), their coefficients are 6 times each coefficient from the second expression. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I don't need to consider the entire expansion. Let me think: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of those coefficients, each attached to a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but is that the correct approach? Let me consider a simpler example to verify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because in the second expression, when \\(c = 1\\), it's 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 (coefficient from first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients from second part). Similarly, for \\(ab\\), it's 2 times 2 = 4, and for \\(b^2\\), it's 1 times 2 = 2. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient of each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), you end up with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, i.e., the constant term. That would make sense if the problem is looking for a specific term, not just any term involving \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, it's the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me make sure. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be different. But as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) again. When \\(c = 1\\), it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when I multiply, each term in the second part is multiplied by 6, and the result is 6 times the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial, but as a coefficient, that would mean 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1, coefficient of \\(a \\times 1/c\\) is 1, similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because when you set \\(c = 1\\), the sum is 2. So, that aligns with the idea that the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in that case, the sum is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to zero. That would mean I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating by considering all coefficients, but maybe the problem is only interested in the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so \\(c^0\\). Let me check that approach.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, but now I'm thinking maybe it's asking for the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. So, which is it?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, giving 384. But maybe the problem is expecting the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the context where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are variables, and the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified \\(c^0\\), it would be 120. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^2\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) in the second polynomial. But since it's not specified, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial again. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a specific example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a c^2\\) is 1, \\(a \\times 2\\) is 2, and \\(a \\times 1/c^2\\) is 1. Similarly for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 4, which is 1 times 4. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a c^2\\) is 1, the coefficient of \\(a\\) times constant is 2, and so on.\n\nSo, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm now confused because earlier I thought it might be 120, but that was when looking for the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. But given that it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. So, maybe I should consider both interpretations.\n\nWait, to clarify, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But since it's just \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the sum over all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by 6, giving 384. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term is 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second polynomial. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually a polynomial, but I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only make sense if it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting interpretations here. Let me try to see if I can find a definitive approach.\n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, when they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they're referring to the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, they're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if they were asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since they didn't specify \\(c\\), it's more likely 384.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the variables are separate, so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to resolve this, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually phrased. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables without specifying others, it's often considering the term with those variables and any possible exponents for the others. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, leading to an infinite number of terms, which isn't practical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, making it a constant term. Therefore, I'll go with 120 as the answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me recompute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second polynomial. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\), where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in that case, the problem should have specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since it didn't, perhaps the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the variables are separate, so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term is 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute both possibilities.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify, but typically, when asking for a coefficient in a product involving multiple variables, it's often looking for the term where the other variables cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps I can consider the entire expansion as a product and see how the terms interact.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWhen you multiply these two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients, which would give a coefficient that's a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, after considering both interpretations, I think the intended answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). Hmm, so maybe I was too quick to stop there. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, I'll have to multiply each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\). Let me see. \n\nWait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, regardless of the other part. But that seems too straightforward. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right either. Let me think more carefully.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of each term in the product are obtained by multiplying the coefficients of corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve different variables, so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion will just multiply it by a constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that seems more accurate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get the sum of all coefficients. Let me compute that.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the overall coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Since the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (which is the sum of all coefficients) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the constant term is different from the sum of all coefficients. Wait, no, when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, which includes the constant term and other terms. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second polynomial's coefficients. But since the second polynomial is multiplied by the first, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, which doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as I calculated before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand both expressions and look for the specific term. Let me try that approach. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before: \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms would be:\n\n- \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as before. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each multiplication will give me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is correct. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) would give \\(120a^2b^2\\), and similarly, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\) would give \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the coefficients that come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), then it would have been different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) gives \\(120a^2b^2\\), which contributes 120 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\) gives \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), which contributes 90 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), but not to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the term where the second factor is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because if you have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), that's a different term from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, now I'm confused. Earlier, I thought it was 6 * 64 = 384, but now I'm thinking it's 6 * 20 = 120. Which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all the products of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient in the second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier thought that only the constant term contributes. So, which is it? \n\nWait, let's take a simpler example to test this. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But actually, expanding it, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) (i.e., \\(a^1b^0\\)) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps my earlier approach is wrong. \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a constant but depends on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, how would you express that? Because in the expansion, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, how do we represent that? Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in two variables, so in the product, it would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nGiven that, then the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. I need to resolve this confusion. Let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. So, for each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the earlier simple example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), if we take the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a constant. \n\nGiven that, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify, but given the way it's written, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check this again. Let's think about the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n\\) ranges up to 6. Wait, no, actually, in the second expansion, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which is \\(6a^2b^2\\)) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a sum of all those terms, each multiplied by 6, which gives a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term without \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven the problem statement, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both interpretations:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 384\n2. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 120\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but it's part of the expression, I think the correct interpretation is the second one, where we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion\", without mentioning \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But given that \\(c\\) is part of the expression, perhaps the problem expects the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the way it's phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient, which would be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number, which seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute both possibilities:\n\n- Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120\n- Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 6 * 64 = 384\n\nSo, which one is correct? Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(c\\) is present in the expression, but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous. However, in problems like this, unless specified, it's usually the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the other polynomial. So, I think the answer is 120. \n\nBut to be absolutely certain, let me check with the binomial expansions again. \n\nFrom \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, right? So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times whatever the expansion is, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables. But no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might make sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be a separate term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term, so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't seem right because coefficients are usually numerical factors. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's just 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense, because then you have a specific term. So, perhaps I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more plausible. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's do that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but since the expression also involves \\(c\\), it's possible that the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely. I think the more reasonable interpretation is that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, so 120 is the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculations. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
