    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) appear. So, in the expansion, that would correspond to the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, which doesn't affect the variables. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, so that's correct. Multiplying them gives 120.

    "text": " I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). It only affects the powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. \n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms will just get multiplied as well. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would result in a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because the expression is a product of two independent binomials, so each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because it's possible that when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, maybe that's the term they're asking about. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is presented in a way that suggests a numerical answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean adding up all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would involve summing over the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Let me think. \n\nSo, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Each of these terms is then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps they are considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term where \\(c^0\\), so that the coefficient is just a number. So, perhaps I need to compute \\(6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the steps. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so the coefficient is just the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we use the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, because the second part is multiplied by the first, but since I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since I'm just looking for the coefficient, not the variable part, I think it's just 6 times 1, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be any term, but since I'm only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest of the terms in the product involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, it's just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is. Wait, no, that's not right either. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that would be if I were considering the entire product, but actually, no, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute a coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part is multiplied by the first part, and I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by 1, the entire coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not exactly right because the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients. So, when you multiply by 6, each term's coefficient is multiplied by 6, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6, and then the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for any \\(k\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, I think 384 is correct. Let me verify by computing the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. The sum of these coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\quad \\text{has coefficients summed when} \\quad c = 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply it by 6, it will give me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression? Let me think. If I have \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, that means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because multiplying by \\(c^0\\) won't change the power of \\(c\\), so the term will just be a constant. Therefore, the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that calculation again. Actually, \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.

That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by that. So, actually, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from both parts. But wait, in the first part, we have \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes solely from the first part, the second part's expansion doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems off because the second part's terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, actually, since we're only looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when we multiply it by the entire second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the terms from the second part. So, actually, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check this again. Let me think about the entire expression. The first part gives 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since the second part is a separate expansion, the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the sum of coefficients in the second part by expanding it. Let me try that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is multiplied in, so the coefficient should account for all the terms. Wait, but actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by all possible terms from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, as I thought. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem was to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part and multiply by 6. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's just 384. Let me confirm with a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times (c + 1/c), which would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is (1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part). The sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 times 2. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another binomial expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I need to find all the terms in the product where the variables a and b are squared, and then c and 1/c can be anything? Wait, but in the problem, it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about c. So, maybe I'm supposed to treat c as a separate variable and just consider the coefficients in the a and b parts. Let me think. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the second expansion is also a binomial, so let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- When m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- When m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- When m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- When m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- When m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- When m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- When m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, going back to the original expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion (like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), etc.) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion (like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc.). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and see how it interacts with the second expansion. Because when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the resulting terms will be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of a is 2 and the exponent of b is 2, regardless of what happens with c. But in the product, each term will have some power of c. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. That would make sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have various powers of c multiplied to it, but if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we might need to consider all possible terms where a and b are squared, but c can be anything. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just considering the a and b parts, and the c terms are separate. Hmm, but that might not make sense because the expression is a product of two separate polynomials. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all the terms from the c expansion. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the c expansion, so the coefficient would actually be the sum of the coefficients from the c expansion. Wait, let me think again. Let me parse the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating c as another variable. So, in the entire expansion, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) where k, m, n are exponents. But the problem is only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the exponent on c. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the c expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Wait, but in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when we multiply by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where a and b are squared, regardless of c. But wait, that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term has a specific combination of a, b, and c. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, but since the problem didn't specify c, maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in a, b, and c, and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the c expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems a bit odd because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, so let me calculate that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when c=1, which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where c is to the zero power, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, i.e., the term where the exponents of c cancel out. That would make more sense because then it's a single term. So, let me check that approach. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where c is to the zero power is when the exponents cancel out, which happens when the exponent from c and 1/c are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So, looking back at the expansion, the term where c^0 is 20. So, that term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 120. Wait, that makes sense because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, and the only term that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is when multiplied by the c^0 term, which is 20. So, 6*20=120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me verify that again. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with c^0 is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, then it would be 6 times the coefficient of c^k in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's referring to the term where c^0, so the coefficient is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   Since we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (c^0), we multiply the coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, when we multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But actually, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term interacts with the second part. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something in the second part, it's going to be \\(a^2b^2\\) times terms involving \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the variables won't interfere. However, I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression includes \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Now, when we expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, right? Because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the variables would be multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Okay, so let's tackle the second part. I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set up the equation: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this term interacts with the other part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But wait, no, actually, because the two parts involve different variables, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the terms from each expansion won't affect each other in terms of the variables, but they will multiply together in terms of coefficients. \n\nWait, but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that in the entire expression, we're looking for terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination from the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\)? Or does it mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\), and we just need the coefficient of the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? \n\nWait, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms as well. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because when you multiply two polynomials, each term combines the variables from both. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, so it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). That would mean that in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply out the two expressions, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product will be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nThat makes more sense. So, let me proceed with that understanding. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning. I assumed that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If that's the case, then my answer is correct. But if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term, it's referring to a single term, implying that the other variables have specific exponents as well. So, in this case, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum of all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective coefficients from the second expansion. But that would result in a polynomial, not a single number, which doesn't make sense in the context of the question. Therefore, I think my initial interpretation is correct, and the answer is 120. \n\nWait, let me also check if I made any calculation errors. The binomial coefficient for \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and for \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) it's 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120, which seems correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but wait, do I need to consider this part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, right? So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part, which involves \\(c\\), doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe I can consider the coefficients separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider the entire expansion. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, each of those will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part has a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms}\\). When I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if there's a \\(c\\) term, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. So, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply those two terms together, you get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to compute two things: 1) the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found earlier as 6, and 2) the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, I multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.

Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.

    "text": " \n\nNow, I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find that term. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). If I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider that part. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the product of the coefficients from each part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that involves \\(c\\) won't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term will have some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\). So, unless I'm considering the term where the exponents cancel out, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, maybe I don't need to worry about \\(c\\) at all. Let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar (6), and the second part is being multiplied as a whole, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because then when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't affect the variables, just the coefficient. \n\nLet me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the term that won't affect the variables when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we only consider the term where the second factor contributes a \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that doesn't add any variables. So, that term is 20, and when multiplied by 6, gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that any term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\) will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I had before. So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 20 for the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is present only in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), except by scaling the entire expression, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem logical, and I double-checked the binomial coefficients. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because this term will not affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe set the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe term where \\(m = 3\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found, 6, is going to be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. Does that mean I don't need to consider the second part? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), that would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, making it something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term. Multiplying them together gives 120. That makes sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients multiply. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I took a term from the second expansion that's not constant, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), then when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), I would get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I think I've got it right. The coefficient is 120. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me go through it again. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but actually, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in this term. Because when you multiply two expressions, the variables from each part multiply together, but since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables from the second part can be anything\u2014they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but hold on a second. Is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by this, and it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the terms (from the second part) just add more variables. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied, so actually, the coefficient should be multiplied by the entire expansion's coefficients. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that term's coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second part. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I need to reconsider. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined solely by the first part, and the second part just multiplies that coefficient by the entire expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me approach this differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that again suggests that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical value. So, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is the sum of all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second expansion, which again is a polynomial. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply together to form that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the coefficient as a number, implying that we should set \\(c\\) to a specific value or consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, let's assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That makes sense because when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, and only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) term. So, let's proceed with that understanding. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did: it's 6. Next, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would have been 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because it would be a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and the rest is just extra, but that seems unlikely because the expression is a product. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the answer should be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a numerical value. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's a bit ambiguous, but I think the intended answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering both parts of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** and find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)):\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   Set the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients** from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that would be the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two separate expansions. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part contributes a constant term, which is 20, then yes, 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term:**\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately. That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, but each of those terms is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the factors. But in this case, the second factor doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first factor will be multiplied by every term in the second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly right either because the second part isn't just a sum of constants; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient, and when you combine like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponents. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems like it would be a very large number, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that would be the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, as I thought before. But let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). And since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), then 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply that by 6.\n\nHmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit odd because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, and that would require me to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and then multiply by 6.\n\nSo, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384 if we consider all coefficients, but now I'm thinking that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's in the entire expression, considering all variables. So, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers between 0 and 4 and 0 and 6 respectively. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with their own power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, that would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut wait, that seems contradictory to the other approach where I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which is correct? Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's the former, 384. However, I'm not entirely sure because sometimes in problems, they might implicitly assume that you're looking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let's consider the product of two polynomials: \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, you get \\(P(a, b) * Q(c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). When you multiply this by \\(Q(c)\\), you get 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nWait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get terms like 6\\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\), the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the term is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. So, which one is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients of all such terms, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 120. But now, after expanding, I see that it's actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me think about it differently. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), and I multiply them, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) and the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute both ways. First, compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I would compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then multiply by 6, giving 120.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 for each term, but since \\(c\\) is involved, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would actually be 2, because it's multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\). Wait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) is also 1, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 2. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Now, wait a minute, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, or is there more to it? Let me think. Since the entire expression is a product of two binomials, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand them, each term in the expansion of the first will multiply each term in the expansion of the second.

So, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't interfere with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Wait, but I should double-check that. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

However, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second expansion can be any term, but they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean I need to consider all possible terms from the second expansion? Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from the first part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the first part, and the second part contributes to the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression, but only looking at the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

So, in that case, the coefficient is 6. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all of them, but the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, it would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems different from my initial thought. Let me clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's the former: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 64, so 384. But wait, let me make sure. Let me think about how the expansion works. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(k=2\\). Now, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular exponent for \\(c\\), we're supposed to sum over all possible \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from the second expansion, and we need to sum all of them. Now, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we sum all coefficients from the second part by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are present. So, in the expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no. Because the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is one of them. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire coefficient, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would give a different term in the product. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will be a separate term in the product. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, the overall coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120. Let me confirm that. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, giving a coefficient of 6. But this term is then multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum over all m of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I think it's more likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion for that specific term. Wait, but in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. Let me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then 120 would be the answer for \\(k = 0\\). But since it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm assuming it's looking for the coefficient when the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can find that term specifically. The term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears is when \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has a second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I think I need to consider how these two parts interact. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other. That means when I multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part. Wait, no, actually, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the coefficient of that term in the product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients from each multiplication. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that separately to see if it's a constant or not. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by 6a^2b^2. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by 6a^2b^2. But actually, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Let me find that. Using the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating it as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would give me 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem asks for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, I think the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).

Wait, no, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) in each term are \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nNow, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), that will give me a term without \\(c\\), which is what I need. So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) for \\(m\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). Now, let's compute the coefficient for that term. It's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nSo, now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part has a coefficient of 20. Since these terms are multiplied together in the product, their coefficients multiply as well. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives me a constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) with a coefficient of 20. When I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and used the binomial theorem again to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Since these two coefficients are from separate parts of the product, their product gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer. \n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are the only terms that contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product (because any other term in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which we don't want), their product is indeed the coefficient we're looking for. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). The exponents for \\(c\\) in the second part were calculated correctly as \\(6 - 2m\\), leading to \\(m = 3\\) for the constant term. So, everything checks out. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these coefficients gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me see, in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) will give me \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right either because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms involving \\(c\\) will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's tackle that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the \\(c^0\\) term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will give me \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20 because 6 choose 3 is 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of these two coefficients, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But we only want the terms where the product is \\(a^2b^2\\), which means the second term must be a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are independent variables, the product of the two expressions will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients found in the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
