    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply them by all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will get multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), does that mean I just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expression? Or is there more to it? \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so it's not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expression in \\(c\\), which is not a single coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the expression as a polynomial in multiple variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include all possible terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in a single variable. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product as a single expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then you'd have a numerical coefficient. Let me check that possibility. \n\nSo, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That sounds more plausible. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nLet me proceed under that assumption. So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me verify each step. \n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), I correctly identified the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. \n\nThen, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I used the binomial theorem correctly. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To get \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by assuming \\(c^0\\). Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient is usually a constant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 (c + d)^6\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. \n\nGiven that, I think the most plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that. \n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is a bit odd. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. \n\nGiven that, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll proceed with that answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Next, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is 120, so the final answer is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can separate the two parts because the variables are different. That is, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the variables from the second part don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds another coefficient to the product. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Now, to find the sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term just its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then it decreases: 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yep, that's correct. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might need to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I don't think that's necessary. The terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so their coefficients just multiply together. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it as the product of two polynomials, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the other part. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion can be found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, actually, I don't need the entire expansion, just the part that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and on \\(b\\) is 2. Using the binomial coefficient, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has another part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the second part doesn't affect that term because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. That means I can treat the second expansion separately and just consider the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which would change the term we're looking for. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. The first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part contributes 20 as the constant term, so when I multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.

So, when I multiply this term by the entire expansion of the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two separate polynomials. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c\\). But since the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that implies that we need to find the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because only then will the term be a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the second expansion, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second expansion because that's the only term that will result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's go back to the expansion:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero.

Let me compute it again step by step.\n\nFirst, \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider whether other terms from the first expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the second expansion. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expansion as a single term, so when you multiply it by the second expansion, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion. Any other term in the first expansion would have a different power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so they wouldn't result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by any term in the second expansion. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, let me just check my calculations again to be thorough.\n\nFirst, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). Correct.\n\nThen, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term with \\(c^0\\) when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That's the coefficient we're looking for in the first part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that means I need to consider the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so I think that when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all the terms. Let me think about that. \n\nWait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\) and not in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will have different powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient for each term in the product will be \\(6\\) times the respective coefficient from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, no, actually, wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't interfere with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficients are being multiplied by each term. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut let me think again: is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) just 6 times the entire expansion, or is it 6 times each term? Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, so when you collect like terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, I think that is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this another way. Let's compute the product step by step. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion of the second part is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in this expansion. So, for the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in the second expansion). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which we already calculated as 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again: when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have coefficients 6 times the respective coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6 = 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient is the sum of all these contributions. \n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the product of the two expansions and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. \n\nSo, the first expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe second expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, that confirms it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding: 6 + 36 is 42, 42 + 90 is 132, 132 + 120 is 252, 252 + 90 is 342, 342 + 36 is 378, 378 + 6 is 384. Yep, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each term in the second expansion has a coefficient that's part of the binomial coefficients, and since the first part contributes 6, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part and multiplying the relevant coefficients. The coefficient is 384.\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, but I don't need to expand the entire thing, just the part that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), because \\(n = 4\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b^2\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by whatever comes from the second part. But hold on, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since they are multiplied together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times whatever the entire second part evaluates to? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which is a product of two expressions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, the terms from the first part (involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) will be multiplied by the terms from the second part (involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. But wait, that can't be right because the second part has its own variables, and we might be looking for a specific term in the entire product. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6; it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, each contributing their coefficient. So, the total coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for a specific term involving both \\(a^2b^2\\) and a specific power of \\(c\\), like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to compute the coefficient differently, considering the specific term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Let me just confirm that approach. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c) would be the coefficient of that term in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c), because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, in this case, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second part by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Wait, maybe I don't need to expand the entire thing. I just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from when \\(k = 2\\) because the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

So, I think I need to consider both parts of the product. Hmm, but the term I'm interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables independent of \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficients from each part multiply as well. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, you're combining all terms. But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's possible that in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). However, if the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables, then perhaps we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have its own terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all of them, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in the second expansion depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant? But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to re-examine the problem. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the expansion regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the right approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Therefore, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the entire expression by that polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient equal to 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a product of two expressions, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me confirm this approach. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, but maybe I don't need to expand the entire thing. Since I only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can just find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), so if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of the term that's just a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. Wait, that's not possible unless the second expansion has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me check that logic again. \n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is the constant term really 20? Let me recalculate \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). 6 choose 3 is 20, yes, because 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 120 / 6 = 20. So that's correct. And in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. So, multiplying them gives 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean I need to consider that when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or is \\(a^2b^2\\) independent of the c terms? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, then in the second part, any term will multiply it. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the variables are separate. So, when you multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that something is an expression in c, not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Oh, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression as a polynomial in variables a, b, c, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, that would mean that in the expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems complicated. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of a and b. Wait, that makes more sense. Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem might be asking for the coefficient as a polynomial in c. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the numerical coefficient, treating c as a variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the sense of the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c. But that would require more steps. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you can only get it by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1, so that gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the sense of the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then yes, it's 384. Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term in that expansion will multiply the 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when c = 1, so that's 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by substituting \\(c = 1\\), yielding 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, in other words, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), perhaps we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then realize that when multiplied by the second expansion, the coefficient remains 6 times whatever. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and when you multiply by the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is a term in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, actually, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I must be misunderstanding something here. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is from the first part, and then multiplied by any term from the second part.

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering \\(c\\), would just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic. Wait, let me think again. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each of these coefficients. But wait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering \\(c\\), is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the entire second expansion. But since the coefficient is a scalar, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think I must be misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the product is a combination of terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering \\(c\\), would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems to make sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the entire expression:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n   When multiplying two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n3. **Determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product:**\n   Since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we need to consider the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. This is equivalent to evaluating the second expansion at \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire thing. Instead, I can just find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That should be when \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), so if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers, that would be \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider that. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part? Or is it more complicated than that?\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't sound right because the second expression is raised to the 6th power, so it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression evaluated at the appropriate power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expression is multiplied in, but we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the 6 from the first part. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the expansion would be a product of a term from the first binomial and a term from the second binomial. \n\nWait, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so plugging \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expression doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expression evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expression's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression is being multiplied by the first, so each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since the second doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expression, each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second expression is multiplied by the first, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, and since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent, we sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nSo, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the coefficient is just 6, because the second expression is being multiplied, but since it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second expression, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient would be scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. \n\nWait, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this expression is c + 1/c, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it would be (c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be 6 times the entire second expression, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in my simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is (c + 1/c), which is the same as the second expression. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the second expression itself. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expression. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the math again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the answer is simply 6, because the second expression doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second expression, you're scaling the entire first expression by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, making the total coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions: \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * Q(c). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expression. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expression. So, let's recast the problem: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression. \n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we calculated earlier. \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense because the problem is likely asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, the answer should be 120. \n\nLet me recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\n3. To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\n4. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\n5. Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. I initially thought the answer was 384, but that was because I was considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, 120 is the correct answer. \n\nLet me double-check by expanding the expressions. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, yes, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the terms from the second expression won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term will be of the form (term from first expansion) multiplied by (term from second expansion). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term from the first expansion, and when we multiply it by each term from the second expansion, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, which has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) since it only involves \\(c\\). So, is the coefficient just 6?\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each time you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by that coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let me calculate that. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the sum of the coefficients with the individual coefficients. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term from the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would make the coefficient \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, simplifying the second part, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the resulting term is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated earlier, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOh! That's different. I think I made a mistake earlier. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nLet me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense because earlier I thought it was 384, but that was because I was incorrectly considering the sum of all coefficients, which would be if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but in reality, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the only term that contributes is when the second factor contributes a \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20c^0\\), we get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Now, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression. Hmm, but wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't just a single number; it's actually a polynomial in terms of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the product as a whole and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem seems to be asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is expecting me to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve considering the product with the other terms. But since the other terms are in \\(c\\), which are separate variables, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific coefficient, so when multiplied by 6, each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. That might make sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the constant term of the second expansion. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming they mean the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so probably the constant term part. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so when \\(k = 2\\), we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the coefficient here is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (if any) in the second part. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something else, it would change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part must contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the second part is separate, so when I multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient and the power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get 6\\dbinom{6}{k} \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check this with a different approach. Suppose I consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that again gives 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of its coefficients is. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients here are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which matches what I had before. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check this another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion. Let me denote the first part as \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and the second as \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you distribute, each term in the second part adds a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because if that's the case, then I need to find the term where in the first part, it's \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, it's the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, let's see. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically when \\(c\\) is at a certain exponent? I think it's the former, because if it were the latter, it would probably specify \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something similar. So, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the product, all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you distribute, each term in the second part adds a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's the former. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2(c + 1/c)\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But in our case, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me see. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, 6 * sum of coefficients in second expansion = 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's the former. But I'm not 100% sure. Wait, let me think about the wording. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In algebra, when you're given an expression with multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would typically be considered as the coefficient regardless of other variables, unless specified otherwise. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm wrong, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me assume that for now. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, multiplying them gives 120. That seems more reasonable. Therefore, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but I'm still not sure. Let me try to compute the entire product up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and see. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6*6a^2b^2c^4 + 6*15a^2b^2c^2 + 6*20a^2b^2 + 6*15a^2b^2/c^2 + 6*6a^2b^2/c^4 + 6*1a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) is 36, and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) is 6. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's calculate that. 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, that's 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I'm now more confident that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because usually, when variables are present, you specify all the exponents. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 384. Hmm. Let me think again. The problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's a single term \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But earlier, I thought it might be 120. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. In algebra, when you have an expression like \\( (a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6 \\), and you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're essentially being asked for the sum of all coefficients that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expanded form, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since it didn't specify, I think it's 384. Wait, but let me think about how coefficients work. The coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product of two expressions is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the problem is ambiguous. However, in most contexts, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, it's implied that you're considering the term with those variables and any power of the other variables. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is in the denominator, it's a bit tricky. Wait, but in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those products. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion up to \\(a^2b^2\\) and see. As I did earlier, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But wait, in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when you multiply these, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term in the second, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " Wait, actually, I don't need to expand the entire expression, just the part that will give me \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That should correspond to the term where \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of the second part as well? Hmm, I think so. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients, right? Because the variables in the second part are \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's multiplied by it. But wait, actually, no, because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider what happens when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to find the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the two parts are multiplied together, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents on \\(c\\), that becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and then \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the exponent on \\(c\\) to be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so that contradicts my earlier answer. Hmm, where did I go wrong before? I think the mistake was assuming that we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But actually, we need to find the specific term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\), you need the term in the second expansion that also has no \\(c\\) to get a term that's just a constant (no variables). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the correct answer should be 120. I think my initial approach was wrong because I considered multiplying by all coefficients, but actually, only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.

So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that means I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\), as long as I'm only considering the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's a constant (since we don't want any \\(c\\) terms attached to it). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier, and then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the relevant terms from each binomial expansion. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Okay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), right? So, the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so maybe I need to multiply the two expansions together. But that might get complicated because each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. \n\nWait, no. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we just need the coefficient where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, up to \\(a^4c^{-6}\\). Similarly, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expanded expression, how many terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\)? Each of these terms will have a coefficient of \\(6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they contribute to different terms in the product. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that's how you sum the coefficients. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum their coefficients. \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). \n\nBut the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I found before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of it another way. Let's consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), right? Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) will be of the form \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But that sum is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). And the sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), as I found before. So, that seems consistent. \n\nAlternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead look at the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the same as considering that for each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes \\(6 \\times\\) coefficient of that term in the second expansion to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed only by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nLet me confirm this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand this. The first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get:\n\n- \\(a^2 \\times c = a^2c\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 1/c = a^2/c\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times c = 2ab c\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 1/c = 2ab/c\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times c = b^2c\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 1/c = b^2/c\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because none of these terms have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). Wait, that's not helpful because in this case, the product doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I should pick a different example where the product does have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, perhaps if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^0\\), which is just \\((a + b)^2 \\times 1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1, but in this case, the second polynomial is 1, so the sum of coefficients is 1, and the coefficient from the first polynomial is 1 (from \\(a^2b^0\\)) and 2 (from \\(a^1b^1\\)), but wait, no, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present here because the first polynomial is only squared. So, maybe my initial approach is correct, but I'm getting confused with the examples. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each term's coefficient. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, in this problem, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing something here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, each such term's coefficient is 6 times the coefficient from the second polynomial, and since the second polynomial's coefficients sum up to 64, the total contribution is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), they would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient of 6 times the corresponding binomial coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion more carefully. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nBut just to make absolutely sure, let me try expanding the second part a bit more. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nCalculating that sum: \n\n\\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the sum of coefficients, and instead thought that each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to different terms in the product, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then each of those contributions adds up to 384. \n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\) because the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2. So, using the binomial coefficient, that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the exponent on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which includes both parts. So, I think the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the expansion would have different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expansion? That doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient when combining both parts, considering all possible terms, but only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that still doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a single numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would still be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because if you consider the product, you might have terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, that might make sense. Let me check that possibility. So, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible because then the entire term would be \\(6 \\times\\) (constant term) times \\(a^2b^2\\), giving a numerical coefficient. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically when the power of \\(c\\) is zero? Because if it's regardless, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but that doesn't seem right. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's asking for the coefficient when considering all terms, so actually, it's 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. However, maybe the problem is intended to consider the coefficient when combining all terms, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient is a single number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or just the term where \\(c\\) is zero? Because if it's considering all powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, but that's not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, without considering the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied in. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. However, since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's likely that they want the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me try to see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. Wait, no, the problem is straightforward with binomial coefficients. So, I think my initial approach is correct: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero: 6 - 2k = 0 => k = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, actually, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression because I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I can just find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nSo, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), because \\(n = 4\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for the term \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think about that. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just get multiplied by the entire second expression, but since the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion is a constant (in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are convolutions of the coefficients of the original polynomials. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the same as the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that suggests that I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nSo, first, let me confirm that. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Wait, actually, no, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, to get the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms from each expansion multiply together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either, because otherwise, the product would have terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means I need the constant term in the second expansion, which is indeed when \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. But in this case, since the variables are separate, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term from the second polynomial. Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which would make the term have \\(c\\) powers, which we don't want. So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply these two together, you get 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me just confirm that I calculated the constant term correctly in the second part. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0}\\), which is 20. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is even, from -6 to +6 in steps of 2. So, the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), as we found. So, that's 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think about the entire expansion. If I were to expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms are:\n\n- \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(b^4\\)\n\nAnd the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n- \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(20\\) (the constant term)\n- \\(15/c^2\\)\n- \\(6/c^4\\)\n- \\(1/c^6\\)\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first expansion, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
