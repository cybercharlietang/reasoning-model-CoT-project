    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. Hmm, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, right? It's only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the part of the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and it's being multiplied by the entire second expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but none of these \\(c\\) terms will affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. \n\nWait, actually, no, because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I'm only looking for the constant term in the second expansion, because only the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved? \n\nWait, no, because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^k\\), that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the combined expression. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first polynomial only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut that seems off because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Let's check: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But if I look at the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part, it's 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because in the expansion, \\(a^2\\) appears as \\(a^2c + a^2\\), so the coefficient is 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, for \\(ab\\), the coefficient in the first part is 2, so in the product, it's 2 * 2 = 4, which is correct because \\(ab\\) appears as \\(2ab c + 2ab\\), so coefficients sum to 4. So, applying this logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, the total coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first part). But wait, that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has 7 terms (from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\)), each with coefficients summing up to 64. So, when you multiply 6 by each of those 64, you get 384. But wait, that seems to make sense because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the problem statement, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't account for the second part. Alternatively, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. \n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables don't interact. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but that seems to be the case. For example, if I have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be the product of coefficients from each part. So, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the entire expansion and see. But that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the sum of coefficients in the second part. Since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the variables are separate, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the multiplication. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each term in that sum will multiply 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^k and 6a^2b^2/c^k. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as calculated earlier, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product is A * B. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in A is 6. When I multiply A by B, each term in A is multiplied by each term in B. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in A will be multiplied by each term in B, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in B, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I might be missing something. Let me check with a smaller exponent. Suppose instead of 4 and 6, I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that's not straightforward. Wait, but in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in the case where the first part is \\((a + b)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because in the expansion, \\(a\\) appears as \\(a c + a / c\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant, but if we're considering coefficients as polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. Hmm, maybe my earlier approach isn't correct. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. \n\nWait, but in the example I just did, with \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient isn't simply 1 * 2 = 2. Instead, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come only from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by any term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by each term in the second part. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a constant but a term involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, which would require considering only the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\), then we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), the result would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, but rather 6 times the constant term in the second part. Because only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first part. \n\nSo, let's recast this. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term in this expansion is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), which equals 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me check this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I expand both parts and multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think this makes sense now. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when \\(k = 2\\), and its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set the exponent equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. \n\nHmm, so I think I need to consider the entire expansion and find the term where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared. But since the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I don't think they will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the variables will multiply as well. \n\nWait, but actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, any term in the first expansion will multiply by any term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, I think that when we multiply by the second expansion, which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just get multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be multiplied by something, but in the problem, we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps we are to consider the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables and find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that might not make sense because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. So, unless we are to consider only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) powers, then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient 6 from the first expansion. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times 6. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would give the sum of coefficients. Let me check that.\n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the powers of \\(c\\) should cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials, each term will have powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they might mean the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut another interpretation is that they might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, I'm not sure which one is intended. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible they mean the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But maybe they mean the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which would be 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I can look at an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then expanding, it would be (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be c + 1/c, which is 2 if c=1. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of c, it's just 1 (from a) times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient would be (c + 1/c). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), then it's 0 because there's no c^0 term in that expansion. Wait, no, in that case, the term \\(ac\\) has c^1, \\(a/c\\) has c^{-1}, etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be zero. \n\nBut in the original problem, we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning c. So, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient regardless of c, which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should confirm.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible combinations with other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if they wanted the coefficient where the exponents of c cancel out, they would have specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something similar. So, I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, so the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of that term in the first polynomial and all terms in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me go through it again step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives:\n\n- \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion (6) and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nI think I should consider the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions: one for \\((a + b)^4\\) and another for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each will multiply term by term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see how this term interacts with the other expansion. \n\nWait, hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and when we multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But when we consider the entire product, the terms involving \\(c\\) will affect the overall expression, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term of the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the overall coefficient. But actually, no, that's not quite right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but since the second expansion is multiplied by the first, and we're only interested in the term where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are squared, the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^5\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let's compute that. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and each contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the entire expression, but the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so yes, it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nLet me double-check. The first expansion gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion, when considering all its terms, has a total coefficient sum of 64. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all those contributions, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term (if any) in the second polynomial. But no, that's not correct because the second polynomial isn't a constant; it's a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term adds a coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = P(a, b)\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = Q(c)\\). Then, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is indeed 64, as calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Let me clarify. When I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. \n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, all those coefficients will add up to 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms from both expansions. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6. \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we're essentially summing over all \\(k\\) the coefficients from the second expansion. That is, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). \n\nAnd the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire product and see if there's a term that combines \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that seems more complicated. Because the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, unless we're looking for a specific power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will include all the terms from the second expansion, hence the sum of all coefficients. \n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach is correct. The coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me just confirm by actually expanding both parts. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first will multiply each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from these terms. That is, 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, that confirms it. The coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using generating functions or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is solid. \n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire product. \n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does that mean the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion? That doesn't sound right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of c, and I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of a and b, and the other in terms of c and 1/c. Since these variables are different (a, b, c), they don't interact when multiplying the terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression and any term from the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be when c = 1, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I get 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384. \n\nBut let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by plugging c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the c terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems a bit odd. But actually, no, because the expansion is in terms of c and 1/c, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and any term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me confirm by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this case, each coefficient in the first expansion is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients don't just add up like that. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial is in a different variable, c, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure by another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term in the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But when you multiply by the entire expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by another term: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the whole thing is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But, since \\(c\\) is involved in the other part, I have to think about how that affects things. \n\nWait a second, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. Or is that the case? Let me think. \n\nNo, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the multiplication by terms involving \\(c\\) will result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but these are different terms because they include \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or anything else. So, does that mean that only the term where the second part contributes a coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\), the result would have \\(c\\) in it, which is a different term. So, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term that's a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me make sure. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, the only way to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, let me first calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that calculation again. \n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients can combine in different ways. But in this case, since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, so that the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\), then yes, it's just the product of the two coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) would indeed give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, another way to check: perhaps I can consider the entire product and see what terms would result in \\(a^2b^2\\). Since in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term would have some power of \\(c\\), so it wouldn't be exactly \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. What if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Because when you multiply by the second expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term where the \\(c\\) part is 1, so the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about it differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, each term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be a different calculation, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way that can happen is if the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), because each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only make sense if it's considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in the expanded form, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Each of these has a coefficient, which is the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, but that's only for the term where \\(c^0\\). The other terms have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only referring to the term where \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be a different number, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 120. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first polynomial, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose product gives that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term that is \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

    "text": " \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating each term, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients of the terms combine. However, in this case, the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but hold on, that doesn't seem quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that coefficient won't change when multiplied by the second expression. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\) will result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)? Because when you multiply by the other expression, you're adding terms that have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but none of them will have just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something here. Maybe I should think of it as distributing the multiplication. So, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). \n\nEach term in \\(A\\) is of the form \\(C \\cdot a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(C\\) is the binomial coefficient, and each term in \\(B\\) is of the form \\(D \\cdot c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = D \\cdot c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply a term from \\(A\\) and a term from \\(B\\), we get terms like \\(C \\cdot D \\cdot a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the term from \\(A\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in the term from \\(B\\) are zero. But wait, the term from \\(B\\) can't have \\(c^0\\) because \\(c^{6 - 2m} = 1\\) implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term from \\(B\\) when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). \n\nWe already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might just be 6, but now I'm getting 120. So, which is it? Let me double-check. \n\nWhen I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the term from \\(B\\) is \\(c^0\\). So, the term from \\(B\\) that is \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by 20 from \\(B\\), resulting in a term \\(20 \\times a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 20 times the original coefficient from \\(A\\), which was 6. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. When I expand \\(A \\times B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. The only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\(B\\) is 1, right? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, I get \\(a^2b^2\\). But in \\(B\\), the term that is 1 is when \\(c^{6 - 2m} = 1\\), which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the term in \\(B\\) that is 1 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\), which is 6. So, 20 times 6 is 120. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and since \\(B\\) is a separate expression, when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if \\(A\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(B\\) has a term \\(20\\), then multiplying them gives \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include all the terms with \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We can think of this as a product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when multiplied, doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), 1, \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the only term that would be just \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWe know that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we calculated earlier. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nPutting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it was just 6, but now I'm confident it's 120. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the \\(c\\) terms cancel out to 1. So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, giving 120. \n\nSo, I think the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then, the original expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). Now, if I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, that's 120. So, in the expanded expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 120, and when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), that term contributes 120 to the total. The total expression is 1024, which is much larger, so that makes sense because there are many other terms. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the value of the expression is 1024, and the value of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, which is a part of that total. So, that seems to check out. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We can write this as a product of two binomial expansions. \n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we saw, with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in this expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But hold on, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when finding the coefficient. \n\nHmm, so I think I need to expand both parts separately and then multiply them together. But actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because those won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Or do I? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. \n\nBut wait, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will vary depending on \\(m\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, I think we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second expansion, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\), and if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we're looking for. \n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, maybe not.

The other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) separately and then multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by every term in the second expansion, each of those products will have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for all terms in the product where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of what the powers of \\(c\\) are.

Because each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, effectively scaling its coefficient by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for \\(k\\) from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by each term in the second part, so the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and in the second part, the sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Let's check by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is indeed \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which when considering coefficients, it's 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, that seems to check out. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be \\(2 \\times (1 + 1) = 4\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). \n\nSo, applying that logic back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have variables involved, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, I think this approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k = 2\\) and all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, again, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that again. The term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply, you get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nSince \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). That should correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). \n\nLet me calculate the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expanded expressions together, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms directly, right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant; it's another polynomial. \n\nWait, actually, let me think again. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the term where, in the first part, I have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, I have any term, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms affect this. \n\nWait, no, maybe not. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will have different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-6 + m})\\), but I'm only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents add. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it comes only from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and the coefficient is just the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that's not possible because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part. \n\nLet me check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, no, the general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). \n\nIf I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, that's from the first part, and then I need to multiply it by the term in the second part where \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire product as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match. Since in the second part, we're looking for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, so that's 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which is 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a specific number, not multiplied by a series. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be correct because the question might be expecting a term that's only \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term in the second expansion, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find that sum? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without specifying any terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion's coefficients. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's see. The general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, now I'm confused. So, which is it? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120? The problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But that seems a bit strange because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. I'm not sure, but perhaps the problem expects the answer 120 because it's more specific. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any specific power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the entire second expansion's coefficients. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me see. If I were to look for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then yes, it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut now I'm second-guessing because sometimes in such problems, they might be looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I should confirm both possibilities. \n\nFirst, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. \n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But to be thorough, let me check the expansion again. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, each term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients from 1 to 64. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) involved. In that case, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I calculated earlier, that's when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, perhaps I can look at an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by anything to give \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in this example, \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2(1/c)\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2a(1/c)b\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2(1/c)\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't get both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term from the first expansion without multiplying by something from the second expansion, which only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because you can't have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term without involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first expansion has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would be zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved. But that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. \n\nWait, no, in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean adding up all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. \n\nGiven that, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120. But I'm still a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion's coefficients, which is 384. \n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut then, if I think about the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's a specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut wait, another way: in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges over the exponents from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for various \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for all \\(m\\). But that's equivalent to the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. \n\nSo, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Maybe I should check that. \n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6*20=120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, perhaps I can see what the problem is expecting by looking at similar problems. Usually, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expansions, it's either a specific term or without any condition. If it's without any condition, it's the coefficient times the sum of the other expansion's coefficients. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because in the first expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present; the highest is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) separately. Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), there's still no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero. \n\nWait, that's a different situation because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\). Maybe I should stick with 120 as the answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, maybe I can look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, I think it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nI think I've thought through this enough, and I'm going to conclude that the coefficient is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the entire product**:\n   The expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involves multiplying the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n3. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the total coefficient**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder if I need to expand this as well. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. Because when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine by adding exponents, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, their exponents won't be affected by the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times whatever the second part is. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion. So, maybe I need to find the entire expansion of the second part and then multiply it by the first part's coefficient. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too big, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\), and then I multiply each of these by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's looking for the coefficient when you multiply these two expressions together, focusing on the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems unlikely because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient regardless of other variables. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate terms, but that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then I would need to compute 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, I can compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm assuming too much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually constants, not polynomials. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since the second part is multiplied by that, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come only from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms come only from the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. But that would require considering all possible combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) terms. But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would mean I need to compute 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, as I calculated earlier, is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of those \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting me to compute the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, so 120. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by 6, the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, but that's not a number. Therefore, I think the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, perhaps it's expecting me to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But then, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think. Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I don't need to worry about the c terms because they won't affect the a and b exponents. Wait, is that right? \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them out, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will multiply each term from the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.

So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of c, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. So, when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\), and so on, up to \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually include all these terms, right? Because each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion because if I'm looking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any c terms, then only the constant term would contribute. But that contradicts my earlier thought. \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, which includes all powers of c. So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where m varies. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me think again: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and it's being multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would be \\(6 \\times\\) each coefficient in the second expansion. But actually, when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) is 6 * 1, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(6c^4\\) is 6 * 6, and so on. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of c would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nBut wait, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2 c^m\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions. The first is \\((a + b)^4\\), which as I found earlier, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, each time \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, it creates a new term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where k is the exponent from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each of those coefficients is multiplied by 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)) to contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). \n\nWait, but if I'm looking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any c terms, then only the term where \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second expansion would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, it would only be present when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. \n\nLet me confirm: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I consider the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where m can be any integer from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present when m = 0, because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any c terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of c, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a combination of a's, b's, and c's. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of it differently. The entire product is a sum of terms, each of which is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product is of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m)\\), where k ranges from 0 to 4 and m ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present when k = 2, and m = 0, because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is the middle term. Let me calculate that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of c is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives m = 3. \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that seems more accurate. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Instead, I should only consider the constant term in the second expansion because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) and no c terms. \n\nLet me double-check that. If I expand both parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, and c^{-6}. So, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of these terms becomes \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the entire product, the only term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is the one multiplied by the constant term 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that would be if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's only the term where c^0. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm by another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire product and see how the terms combine. \n\nSo, the first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nWhen you multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the coefficients from the second part, each multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. So, which is correct? \n\nWait, no, because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of c, then each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all c terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any c terms. So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then only the term where c^0 contributes, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, I'm confused now. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of c, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384. \n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and it's being multiplied by different powers of c, so each of those would be separate terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case when c is at the 0 power. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible c terms. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of c, so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product is a combination of a's, b's, and c's. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of c. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut now I'm really confused because I have two different answers depending on interpretation. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 (from ac) + 1 (from a/c) = 2. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) regardless of c, it's 2. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1c^0\\), it's 0 because there's no such term. \n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is 2, considering all c terms. So, maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in my earlier approach, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the term where c^0 is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so which is correct? Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the c terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some c power. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the example I did, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times (1 + 1) from the second part. So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1c^0\\), it's zero because there's no such term. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 384. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of c. So, perhaps it's intended to consider all possible c terms, meaning that the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut now I'm really confused because different interpretations lead to different answers. Let me try to find a definitive approach. \n\nI think the key is to understand whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the c terms, or whether it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c. \n\nIf it's the former, then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. If it's the latter, meaning just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, then it's 120. \n\nWait, let me think of another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the terms are \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)) = 2. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2 (from \\(2abc\\)) + 2 (from \\(2ab/c\\)) = 4. The coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) is 1 (from \\(b^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(b^2/c\\)) = 2. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times (1 + 1) from the second expansion. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times (1 + 1) = 4. \n\nSo, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^k b^{2 - k}\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 64), giving 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but in my earlier thought process, I thought it was 120, but now with this example, it seems to be 384. So, I think I was wrong earlier when I considered only the constant term. \n\nWait, let me confirm with the example again. In \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 times 2 = 2. \n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm now confused because in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the earlier approach where I considered only the constant term, I got 120. So, which is correct? \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. \n\nGiven that the problem states \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying c, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, which would be 384. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's intended to consider all possible c terms, meaning that the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Let me calculate the sum of coefficients in the second expansion: \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because in my initial approach, I thought it was 120, but after considering the example, I think 384 is correct. \n\nWait, let me try to calculate it another way. Let's compute the entire product and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. \n\nThe first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply these, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears only once, multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which is correct? \n\nWait, no, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when multiplied by the constant term 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but then why did the example with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) give a coefficient of 2 for \\(a^2\\), which is 1 * 2? Because in that case, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. \n\nSo, in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the specific multiplication, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by 20 to give \\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by other terms, it gives \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any c term, then it's 384. \n\nBut the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of c, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, which would be 384. \n\nWait, but in the specific multiplication, the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(120a^2b^2\\), because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c, so they wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible c terms. So, the only term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when multiplied by the constant term 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but that contradicts the example I did earlier. Let me check that example again. \n\nIn the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the expansion is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2\\) appears in \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 + 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion. So, that would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, for \\(ab\\), it's 2 * (1 + 1) = 4. \n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the specific multiplication, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c is when multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, so which is correct? I'm getting conflicting answers based on different interpretations. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of c, which would mean that all terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384. \n\nBut in reality, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c only comes from multiplying by the constant term, which is 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify c^0. It just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the context of the entire product, which includes terms with c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 120, because that's the only term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 2, which included both \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). So, perhaps in that example, the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of c, which is 2. \n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c would be 120, because that's the only term where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the c term. \n\nWait, but in the example, the term \\(a^2\\) was present in two terms: \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would have been 2, considering both terms. \n\nBut in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in one term: \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, I think I was confused earlier because I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all c terms, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, multiplied by the constant term. \n\nSo, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I'm only interested in the term where the ex"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the binomial coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts. However, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Instead, I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant factor when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), any term in the first expression multiplied by any term in the second expression will just scale the term by some constant. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, no, because the second part is a separate expansion, so the overall expression would be the product of two expansions. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me break it down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. \n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is a single term, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not correct because the second expansion isn't being multiplied by just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's being multiplied by the entire first expansion. \n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, as the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is just scaled by the entire expansion of the second part. But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might be it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHow do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that substituting 1 for all variables gives the sum of the coefficients. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion might contribute some terms that affect the coefficient? But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the multiplication won't create any new terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) first. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. \n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is expecting the coefficient considering all possible terms, but I think no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the product, and the coefficient would include all the constants from the other expansion. So, yes, 384 should be the correct answer. \n\nI think I've considered it from multiple angles, and each time I arrive at 384. So, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, I think I need to consider both expansions together. \n\nLet me write down both parts:\n1. \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\)\n2. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) needs to be expanded as well.\n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) unless they affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied together. Wait, but actually, when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will multiply every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, right? It's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will remain the same as in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is separate. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\( (P(a, b)) \\times (Q(c)) \\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), but since \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate term, and when you multiply \\(P(a, b)\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the first expansion's terms. Wait, no, actually, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, its coefficient will be multiplied by every term in the second part, effectively summing all the coefficients of the second part and multiplying by 6.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me think: if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when I multiply it by each term in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so we have to sum all the coefficients of the second expansion to get the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the first, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P and Q, where P is in variables a and b, and Q is in variable c. Then, the product P * Q will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P, when multiplied by Q, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(each term in Q)}\\). Since Q is in terms of c, each term in Q is a coefficient times some power of c. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients from Q multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from P. Because each term in Q contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) for some k. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we have to sum all the coefficients from Q and multiply by the coefficient from P.\n\nTherefore, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, I can expand both expressions separately and then multiply them, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products where the exponents of a and b add up to 2 each. But since the second polynomial doesn't involve a or b, the only contribution comes from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second polynomial is raised to the 6th power, so it's likely contributing a factor.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since the second polynomial has only c terms, and the first has a and b terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the a and b exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, as calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. To find the sum of coefficients, set c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), and the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). The sum of these coefficients is when c = 1, so indeed, it's 2^6 = 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 c^{6}\\), \\(6a^2b^2 c^{4}\\), ..., down to \\(6a^2b^2 c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient of 6 multiplied by the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of c is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, the coefficient is the sum over all possible c terms, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm making a mistake here. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum over all terms in P that are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all terms in Q, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Since Q is a polynomial in c, the sum of its coefficients is when c = 1, which is 64, as calculated before. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, to put it another way, if I think of the entire expression as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\text{something}\\right) \\times \\left(\\text{something else}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThen, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, all the terms from the second part contribute their coefficients to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me recalculate the coefficients:\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients are:\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nAnd the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: sometimes, when you have expressions like \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion can have negative exponents, but since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a separate variable, the exponents on c don't affect the exponents on a and b. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum from the second expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, it will remain as \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, and that will be part of the overall expansion. \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. \n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\Rightarrow k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as calculated earlier. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps are straightforward: expand each part separately, find the relevant coefficients, and then multiply them together since the two parts are multiplied in the original expression. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\). Because when I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term in the first part and then just multiply it by the entire second part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, the second part can be anything because it's multiplied by 1 in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. \n\nNo, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a numerical factor, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't possible because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me correct that. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, the second part can be any term, but we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by the sum of the coefficients. \n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct either. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply by each term in the second part, you're adding up all the contributions. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the coefficients from the second polynomial are just constants. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, maybe I need to clarify the problem. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that includes all the terms from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. \n\nThat sounds more accurate. So, let's proceed with that approach. \n\nFirst, as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense unless we're considering a specific term. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But earlier, I thought the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But that contradicts the previous result of 120. So, which one is correct? \n\nWait, no, I think I confused two different concepts here. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. But in this case, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's not the sum of all coefficients, but rather the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not the case here. The problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which I think implies that it's considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nTo confirm, let's think about the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) times 6, but that's not quite right because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) where \\(6 - 2k = m\\). But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying the power of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. \n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit unclear. However, in the context of such problems, it's usually implied that we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a product with another expression, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), it would have been 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial, but that's not the case here. So, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as before: \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is: \n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 \\times 6 a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6 \\times 15 a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, which gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume they want the coefficient where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as calculated by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponent. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial, and we want the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which comes from the second polynomial, the coefficient is just the product of the two coefficients, 6 and 20, giving 120. \n\nSo, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Okay, that part seems straightforward. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient we just found. Let me think about how to approach this. Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider how the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), unless those interactions somehow affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the part of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that contributes to the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, let me clarify that. When I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term's coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\). \n\nBut the original question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. Wait, no, actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), its coefficient in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a polynomial where each term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), for different exponents \\(k\\). \n\nHowever, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because otherwise, if we're considering all terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and it would have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or \\(a^k b^m c^{-n}\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have \\(k=2\\), \\(m=2\\), and \\(n=0\\). So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, to find this coefficient, we can separate the problem into two parts: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did and it's 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so let's proceed step by step. First, as established, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just verify that. So, when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. In this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when considering \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we only consider the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of the constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both expansions and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but in the product, each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other part can be considered as a constant in this context? Wait, no, that might not be right because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. Wait, no, because each term in the product is a combination, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each product term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that the entire second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. Wait, that might not make sense because the second part is a series in terms of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is a term from the first expansion) by each term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each of those terms would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), depending on the term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), that would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k\\) must be zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in other words, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let me compute each part. First, as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as per the binomial expansion. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, which is correct because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply these two coefficients together, we get 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion, when looking for the constant term, has coefficient 20. Multiplying them gives 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply by 20 from the second part. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that.

I don't think so because any other term in the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20).
