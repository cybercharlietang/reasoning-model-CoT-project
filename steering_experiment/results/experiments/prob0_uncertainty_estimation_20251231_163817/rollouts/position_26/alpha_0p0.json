Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're effectively treating the \\(c\\) part as a constant, but actually, we're only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. So, that part checks out. I think I did everything correctly. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
