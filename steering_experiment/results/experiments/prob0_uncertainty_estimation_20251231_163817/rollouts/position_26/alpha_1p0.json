The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only term that will contribute to this is the term where the second factor is \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we're not interested in. So, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

Let me work on that second part. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), again using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply if the terms are in the same \"position\" in their respective expansions. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first polynomial, and we need the term from the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficients multiply, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I were to think about expanding both polynomials and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would indeed come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and \\(c^0\\) from the second, with coefficients 6 and 20 respectively. So, 6 * 20 is 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found, right? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, and since they are being multiplied together, their coefficients multiply as well. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from the constant term) is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check each step. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is correct, and the term where the exponent is 0 occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), you only consider the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then multiply it by the term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 \u00d7 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.
