    "text": " Wait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. But wait, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part when it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when we multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's going to be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\((\\text{term from first expansion}) \\times (\\text{term from second expansion})\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, it just gets multiplied by the coefficients from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, is it just 6? But that seems too simple. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it will still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of the term, but with some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me verify this another way. Let me expand both parts separately and see. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as we saw, has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 c^{6}\\), \\(6 a^2b^2 c^{4}\\), \\(6 a^2b^2 c^{2}\\), \\(6 a^2b^2 c^{0}\\), and so on, down to \\(6 a^2b^2 c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6}\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{4}\\) is 6, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of what the exponent of \\(c\\) is. So, in effect, it's the sum of all coefficients of terms \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total contribution is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, summed together, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me check another way. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're only concerned with \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, so 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? Because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, essentially, I'm looking for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, yes, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions. The first expansion only affects the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the second expansion only affects the \\(c\\) terms.

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe I do. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the variables from each expression are multiplied together. So, if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then any term from the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or does it mean the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and no other variables? Hmm, I think it's the latter. Because in the entire expression, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be multiplied by the sum of all terms from the second expression. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're only interested in the part of the expression that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of a specific term in a product is the product of the coefficients of the terms being multiplied. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think carefully. If I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms where each term of \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire sum of terms in \\(Q\\). But that doesn't seem right because the sum of terms in \\(Q\\) is just a number, so the coefficient would be that number times 6 (from earlier). Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Oh! I think that's it. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that means I need to find two things: 1) The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. 2) The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply by 1 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second part, the coefficient would just be the product). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, no. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that. First, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, and when you multiply them, you get 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, yes, it's 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through it again. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible products where the exponents add up to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part, but only the term that doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, yes, that term is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's solid.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4 factorial is 24, 2 factorial is 2, so 24/(2*2) = 6. Correct. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6*5*4/(3*2*1) = 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will get multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think again. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms from \\(c\\) as well. But that seems complicated because then the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, looking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is a sum involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, that suggests that perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems odd because the second part is part of the product. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Let me check if that's the case. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I can proceed as follows: First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply 6 by that coefficient, it will give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. So, let's compute that. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.

I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to expand the entire second part. Let me think. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't have any relation to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficients from the second expansion will just multiply the coefficients from the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Wait, so maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) as variables, and I'm supposed to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but in the context of the entire expression, which is a product of two expansions. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and when you multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, no. Let me think differently. Since the two expressions are multiplied together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term from the second expansion, but I don't see how that would work. Wait, maybe I need to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems like a possible approach. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem might be expecting a different interpretation. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try that approach. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I suppose that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no. Wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum all the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) multiplied by 6? Wait, no, that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not how it works. The product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of the coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the other expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the other part is multiplied by any term, but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because then it's not a single coefficient but a polynomial. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, which gives 120. So, that must be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the coefficient we found, 6, is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term is already extracted from the first part, I think the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts, so maybe I need to consider how the coefficients combine. Wait, but actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), right? Or maybe it's asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, considering all terms. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so actually, when you expand the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a huge number, which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only affected by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the entire second part is multiplied by that. But wait, no, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a product. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's unclear. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would indeed be the case. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a sum of terms each of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they all contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I thought earlier, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Hmm, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the term that's \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expression involves \\(c\\) terms. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\) or something like that. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second expansion, you'd end up with a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes there. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it's just a term in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), perhaps we just need the coefficient from the first part, and the second part can be considered as a separate expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so when you expand both parts, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term only comes from the first part, so the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it will still be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), but multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is part of a product, so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(c\\), but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that might not be correct because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're supposed to consider the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That makes sense. So, let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, from the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I got 120. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut earlier, I thought that maybe the problem was only considering the constant term in the second expansion, which gave me 120. So, which is it? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each such term is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's effectively asking for the sum of all coefficients that come with \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, in my first approach, I thought that the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me clarify the problem statement: It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the expanded form, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it differently. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the entire second expansion, so 1 times (c + 1/c). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 1 times (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial, but the coefficient would be 1 times 2, which is 2, if we're considering the sum of coefficients. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would vary with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in the second expansion, you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, I think I was confused earlier, but now I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is multiplied together, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because we're looking for the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and the \\(c\\) terms would just be multiplied by 1, I think. Wait, no, actually, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, then the rest of the terms would come from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we need those terms that don't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expression, so when we multiply by the second expression, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that perhaps we're only considering the constant term in the second part, because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), which would change the overall expression. Wait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the entire expression would have terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it as well. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, resulting in a term \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is what we're interested in. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just the part from \\((a + b)^4\\), because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, that would be 6. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expanded expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms as well. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that seems a bit odd because the second expansion would add more terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, perhaps the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as I found earlier, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found before. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would give me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might just be 6, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just 6, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, leading to an infinite number of terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and ignoring \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, since each term in the first part is multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and treating the entire second expansion as a scalar. But that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is another variable. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that seems right. Let me just double-check. In the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, but that's not right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what it's multiplied by in the other part. Wait, no, no. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the term from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{something}\\). But actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the terms would be combined. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and it's then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 times 64? That would be 384. But that seems too large. Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, but let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is a term without \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Wait, no, that's not right. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient multiplied by all possible terms from the second polynomial. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not polynomial expressions. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second polynomial. But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and that's it. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (20), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 120. But earlier, I thought that maybe the coefficient would be 6 times the entire sum, but that was incorrect. Instead, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, but only the constant term from the second polynomial will contribute to the term where the variables are just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second polynomial would introduce \\(c\\) terms, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean I don't need to consider the second part? Or is it part of the entire expression, so I need to multiply the coefficients? Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and it's multiplied by some term in the second part. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean we're looking for all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever comes from the second part. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's do that. Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) => \\(2m = 6\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a constant term 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I missed anything. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and we're looking for the same variables, the second part contributes a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's just a constant multiplier. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Hmm, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the \\(c\\) part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes both parts. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just be coefficients for that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) just \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. Because when you multiply by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is one part, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be considered as coefficients. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But if I actually expand \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the terms are \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, because it's \\(ac + a/c\\), so the coefficient is 1 for each term, but when considering the coefficient as a number, it's actually 2. Wait, but in this case, if I were to collect like terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different, they don't combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the same as 1 (from \\(a + b\\)) times 2 (from \\(c + 1/c\\)). So, yes, that seems to work. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, it becomes 6 times that coefficient times a^2b^2 times the corresponding power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't have \\(c\\) in it, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the product, so it's the product of the coefficients from each part. Let me try to clarify.\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found before. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which is 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term combines the variables from both. So, actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term would have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to result in a coefficient that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't give a numerical coefficient; it gives a polynomial. So, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would just be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem to make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as a term without \\(c\\). So, let me think about that. If I take the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider all terms, but I think that's not the case because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that's not typical. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's considering the entire expansion and the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all these terms, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible because then the coefficient is a constant, and the term would be \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nLet me recap to make sure. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficients from the second part won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part doesn't depend on \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by the second part, which is a series in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that any term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) would affect the coefficient. Wait, but actually, the second expansion only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, every term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\) because of the binomial expansion on the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term where \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how the second part affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem isn't asking about any specific power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because when you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), which doesn't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute its own coefficient to the product's coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the entire expression, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by some term from the second part, but since the problem doesn't specify any powers of \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering the coefficient irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second part is independent, so the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate polynomial. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. The other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6 \\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second part, we get 6 \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. As we calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the entire expression, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, that's a different interpretation. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), then it would be different. But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check this again because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the entire expression, and the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient might involve more steps. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, I think the approach is correct. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply, but the variables add their exponents. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But each of those terms has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly correct either because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the other terms (involving \\(c\\)) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by 6. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has its own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by all the terms in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is being multiplied, so the coefficients should combine. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\), which simplifies to \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all m of \\( \\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} \\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6. Then, for each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and when multiplied by 6, gives 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible m. So, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum over m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.

But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then since the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not right either because the sum of coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm not thinking correctly. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and to get \\(c^0\\), we need the term in the second part where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the term where \\(c^0\\) as well) is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is just multiplied in, so the coefficient would just be 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the entire expression is expanded, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the \\(c\\) terms would be part of each term in the expansion. Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misreading it. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product of these two expressions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, but it will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then considering that it's multiplied by the entire second part. But that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense, and as I calculated earlier, that's 120. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
