    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider the expansion of this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me think: when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's sufficient to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then consider how it's multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that might not be the case. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, like \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part and \\(c\\) in another, the coefficients of terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second part has a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the second part is in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the expression also has \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem might be asking for the coefficient as a number, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second part. Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two separate binomials, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part. Because any other term in the second part would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, as I found earlier, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial.

But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by 1 (i.e., the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and 20 from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Hmm, maybe I need to check the problem again. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is... well, perhaps any power, but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\). Hmm, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as variables and \\(c\\) as a constant, but that's not the case because \\(c\\) is also a variable.

Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) is a variable. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, regardless of \\(c\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression when multiplied out, but without considering \\(c\\), which might not make sense either. Hmm, perhaps I need to look for a term where both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\) appear together, but the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is a separate term, but that doesn't seem right. \n\nWait, no, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe that's not the case. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check that possibility. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can consider the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) add up to the desired exponents. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because I want the total exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. Let me find that coefficient. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nNow, since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. \n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent from \\(c\\) is canceled out by the exponent from \\(1/c\\). So, as I did earlier, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying these together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're also considering the \\(c^0\\) term) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and we're considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is in the second part, we multiply the two coefficients together. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, but I'm not sure how the second part affects it. Wait, maybe the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part will contribute a factor that's just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check that. So, if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) will be zero when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which happens when \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me go through it again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) is 20. When you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second expansion that contributes is the constant term, because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would change the term we're looking for. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms from each will multiply term by term. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and multiplying by 1 doesn't change the term. Alternatively, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term in that expansion will have some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\), which is \\(c^{-1}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product, the second part must contribute a term that's \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations.

So, does that mean that when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it would get multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

But actually, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their exponents are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would remain the same regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, times the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some polynomial in } c\\), then when I multiply these together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product with coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't sound right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) in it. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by it, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But if we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're supposed to treat the entire second expansion as a single term, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would involve terms from the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed as if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's a constant, not another polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables as separate, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the terms are just part of the expression but don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, given that the problem includes the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve the product of the two binomials. So, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check my reasoning again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Yeah, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which sums to 64 when \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in the product will be of the form \\((\\text{terms in } a \\text{ and } b) \\times (\\text{terms in } c)\\).

But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), specifically the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I should sum all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\)? Or is the question asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, perhaps that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of what \\(c\\) is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the other part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). When this is multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no. Actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when we multiply them together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and since the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part that don't involve \\(c\\), but that seems confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Wait, but that's not possible because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be zero because there are no terms in the second expansion that are just constants. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) does have a constant term when expanded. Let me check that. So, using the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) will be zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which happens when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by this constant term 20 from the second expansion, we get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but I thought earlier that the second expansion didn't contribute any constant terms, but now I see that it does. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found that the constant term (which is the term without \\(c\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, including the constant term 20, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect this coefficient, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but actually, no, that's not right either. Wait, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will combine with the terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that term will be multiplied by all the possible terms from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me check. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm supposed to consider each term's contribution. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just another polynomial that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part in the product. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the variables in one part are independent of the other. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then any term in the expansion will be of the form (term from first expansion) * (term from second expansion). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is just a constant factor. Wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product. Wait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire product is a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

But that seems incorrect because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, leading to 384. Therefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a single expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will have coefficients. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the sum of all the products of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion with each term from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have terms in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum over \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm my earlier thought. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning that \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I should consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, including all possible \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. So, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's the first case, so 384. Let me check with another approach. Let me compute the product of the two expansions. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it? Hmm, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression. Let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed when multiplying the two expansions. But since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a term that includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, I'm confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), would produce terms that include both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would give me a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. That would make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make the total coefficient the product of those two coefficients. Let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will combine with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed, which would be when the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120 by considering only the constant term. I'm getting conflicting answers here. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me try to see which makes more sense. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's just 6 times 64, which seems straightforward, but maybe the problem expects that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Let me see. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: The problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In this case, every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond possibility: The problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In this case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer would be 120. But to be sure, let me see if the problem specifies anything about \\(c\\). It doesn't; it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in that case, the coefficient would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so it would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's only concerned with the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which is in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of it as a generating function, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because earlier I thought it might be 120, but now I'm convinced it's 384. Let me try to see if that makes sense. Let's take a simpler example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\n3. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Set \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but let me make sure. The expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would involve \\(c\\) terms, which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, the only way that could happen is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is there a constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me check. The constant term would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent to be zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term 20 from the second part, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but hold on a second. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would only come from the term where the second part is 1 (the constant term), because any other term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6a^2b^2. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 when c^0. So, multiplying those, 6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, identifying the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate from the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\).

But that seems like it would be an expression involving \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is considering the entire expression, but only the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the coefficients are multiplied together. Let me think again. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these together, you get terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is fixed. Then, for each \\(m\\) in the second expansion, we'll have a term with \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be. Because if we consider the entire product, each term is a product of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all these coefficients. Wait, but that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the entire product and just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the answer is 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. To check, let's consider the expansion. Each term in the product is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). For each \\(m\\), this term is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), the sum becomes \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. However, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when problems mention multiple variables, they might be looking for a specific term. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Yeah, I think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**: Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**: The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the other. But in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but maybe the problem wants the coefficient when considering all variables. Wait, no, I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by 6, and when you collect all the terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the other expansion. Wait, but that seems complicated. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by 6, and then you'd have terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{something}\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all the terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would involve two steps: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That sounds more plausible. So, let's proceed with that approach. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can again use the binomial theorem. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, that would be the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would be the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's proceed with that understanding.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the constant term.\n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) times \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering \\(c\\) as another variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being treated as a separate term, but in reality, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient is a number, 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1)^6\\), but that's just a guess. But assuming the problem is correct, then I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a constant.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire product and looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, the only sensible interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). When I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me calculate the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and confirm that the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the constant term is 20, and multiplying by 6 gives 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just write it out clearly.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nFinally, multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so I don't think they affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) directly. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider the coefficient separately because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but in this case, the variables are different, so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is from the first part, and the second part would contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by 1 (the constant term) from the second expression. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want this exponent to be zero for the constant term. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), so 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the term from the first expansion that is \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, and then it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can contribute to a term without \\(c\\) (i.e., a term that's just a number) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the entire coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't correct. Wait, no, because each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the term where the second part is the constant term. So, I think my initial thought was correct: the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\) for some \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6, as before. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, as I found earlier, has a constant term of 20. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (with coefficient 6) by the constant term 20, we get 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from the first expansion? For example, if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^1\\) and the first expansion had a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), would that contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^1\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), those terms wouldn't contribute to the coefficient we're looking for. Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific term, not the entire expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is an expansion in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression with \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and we need to collect all those coefficients. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is not a number but a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is likely expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term in the second expansion, but that's not indicated. Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. That makes more sense. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I considered that this term would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. But that would give 6 * 64 = 384, which seems high. Alternatively, if they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think about the problem again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, but that seems too large. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in typical problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), they usually mean the coefficient when considering all possible powers of the other variables. So, in this case, it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if there's another way to interpret it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make it 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Given that, I think 120 is the more reasonable answer because otherwise, the coefficient would be a huge number, and it's more likely that they want the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.

Let me check: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\).

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is simply 6, but that seems too simple. Wait, let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term from the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as 1, but that would make the coefficient 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I thought earlier, so 6 times 64 is 384. But let me verify that. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\): \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them gives \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's not a single number but a polynomial. However, in the original problem, the answer is expected to be a single number, so perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which equals 120. That seems more reasonable. So, the answer should be 120. Let me double-check this approach. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But if we're only interested in the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. However, given that the problem is asking for a single coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
