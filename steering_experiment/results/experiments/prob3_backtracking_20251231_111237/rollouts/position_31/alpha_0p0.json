Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, that's right. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, yes.

    "text": " Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the final step would be: Final result: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 29524 * 3. Let's do 29,000 * 3 = 87,000. Then, 524 * 3 = 1,572. Adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3:\n29,524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, writing it out: 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each additional 1+3( is another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, my earlier calculation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, I think my calculation is accurate. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let's compute that. 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 + 1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 + 1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 + 2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and double-checking my arithmetic, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression should be 88,572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can check one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's pick Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 was 364. So 3*364=1,092. Then 1 + 1,092=1,093. Wait, I think I wrote it as 1093 earlier, but in the initial calculation, I wrote it as 1093, which is correct. Wait, 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. So that's correct. Similarly, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3*1093=3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279=3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,000=9,000; 3*280=840. So, 3*3,280=9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840=9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,000=27,000; 3*841=2,523. So, 3*9,841=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Yes, that seems accurate.

By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer's value is determined by the formula 1 + 3*(previous layer's value).

Let me do that multiplication: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check my calculations because that number seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct.

Maybe it's correct after all. But let me think again\u2014does each layer really just add another multiplication by 3 and adding 1? It seems like each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series or something similar? Wait, maybe I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again\u2014does the problem have nine layers or eight? Let me recount the number of parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 occurs:\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...)), then another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. The first inner is (1+3(...))\n3. Then another (1+3(...))\n4. Continuing until the last (1+3).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 1+3 expressions. Each time we have 1+3(...), which is a layer. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nEach step adds another layer. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3: Layer 1\n- Then the next is 1+3*(Layer1): Layer2\n- Then 1+3*(Layer2): Layer3\n- Continuing until Layer9.\n\nWait, but the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, the total layers are 9, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, a_9 =29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting after the first 3(:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, each one adds a layer. So, yes, there are 9 layers, meaning a_9 is the innermost, and then we have 8 more layers wrapping around it, but since we started counting from the innermost as Layer1, the outermost would be Layer9. So, yes, 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, the computation seems correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step again, just in case I made an error in multiplication earlier.\n\nCompute a_9 =29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27 + carryover 2: Wait, no, actually, let me do it properly.\n\nWait, let's write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Write down7, carryover2.\n\nNow, the next digit is 2 (from 29524, which is 2 9 5 2 4). Wait, no, 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 \u00d73=12: write 2, carryover1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7: write7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15: write5, carryover1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28: write8, carryover2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8: write8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d73=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, the sequence is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The closed-form formula we derived earlier was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that gives us a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is the same as before. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, let's compute that: Total = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me verify with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73. 29000\u00d73 = 87000. 524\u00d73 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me recheck each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I started, I thought there were nine layers, but let me count the number of times \"1+3(...)\" appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each adding another layer. So, my initial approach was correct, computing from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, then multiplying by 3.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about this is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous layer. So, each layer can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, that's the same approach as before, which gives us 88,572.\n\nBut wait, is there a formula for such a recursive sequence? Let me think. The recursion here is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the recurrence relation. Because sometimes it's easy to miscount the exponent or miscalculate the constants.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, my earlier step-by-step computation was correct, and the final result is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations or the reasoning. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost layer outward and using a recursive formula, we find the value of each layer until the outermost one, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*A - 1/2 => 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I still get the same result. That gives me even more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer. I think I've double-checked it thoroughly, so I'm pretty sure that's right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 24 * 3 = 72, write down 2, carry over 7. 524 * 3 is 1572, plus the carried 7 is 1579. So, 1579, but wait, that's just part of it. Wait, actually, I think I made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me do it properly. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. So, putting it all together, the entire expression equals 88,572. Wait a second, that seems a bit high. Let me verify my steps again because sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, especially with so many layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, plus 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute this carefully. 9000*3=27,000. 800*3=2,400. 40*3=120. 1*3=3. Now, adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400=29,400. 29,400 + 120=29,520. 29,520 + 3=29,523. So, 3*9841=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let's compute that again. 29,524*3: 20,000*3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000=87,000. 87,000 + 1,500=88,500. 88,500 + 60=88,560. 88,560 + 12=88,572. So, 3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check once more because I want to be absolutely sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, especially with such large numbers. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve the recurrence relation. Let's write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. That's consistent with what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I think this method is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors when manually computing each layer. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation can simplify the problem. I should remember this approach for similar nested expressions in the future. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, I found that the innermost layer results in 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I confirmed that the value of the innermost expression after nine layers is 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach led me to the same answer. So, I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, we find that each layer's value builds on the previous one. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine that the innermost expression after nine layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1:4\n\nLayer 2:13\n\nLayer 3:40\n\nLayer 4:121\n\nLayer 5:364\n\nLayer 6:1093\n\nLayer 7:3280\n\nLayer 8:9841\n\nLayer 9:29524\n\n3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut let's see, the initial condition is a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, which would have saved time, but since I was doing it step by step, the manual computation worked too.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, recomputed the layers, and even used a different method (recurrence relation) to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. So, Layer 7:1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. So, Layer 8:1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400=29,400 +120=29,520 +3=29,523. Then Layer 9:1 +29,523=29,524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct.

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a second, let me double-check that multiplication. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with multiple layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This looks like a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. If I consider each step as a term in a sequence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, starting from 1. Wait, but the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the layer number starting from 1. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added constant each step. But the recurrence relation approach seems to have worked well, giving me confidence in the answer. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer using the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Solving this recurrence, we find that each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer, \\( n = 9 \\), giving \\( a_9 = 29,524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72.

Let me compute 29,524 * 3 digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, it's 88,572. Wait, but earlier when I broke it down, I had 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24, which is 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, I started from the innermost, which was 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer added another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then multiply by 3 to get 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check each step again to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, this recurrence relation can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's look at the next term: a_2 = 13. Using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Alternatively, using the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting back into 3A + B = 4: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, that confirms the result.

Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3=88572. That seems correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Hmm, 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, the result should be 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems to be correct. Each time, I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could be used to compute this without going through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see. The recursive formula is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) with L(1) = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^10)/2 - 1/2. Because n=9, so 3^(9+1)=3^10. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches my earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result I got earlier. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. Each step seems to follow logically, and the closed-form formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3. Let's do this step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe a formula or a pattern that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step, which was a bit time-consuming. I remember that expressions like these, which have a repetitive structure, can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4, as we computed earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n. Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 1 more than three times the previous term. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3*C = 1\n-2*C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nWow, that works perfectly! So, the general formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10} to check:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n=9.\n\nSo, substituting n=9, we get 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is to recognize the pattern, find the general formula, and then plug in n=9. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step, but since I was able to do it both ways, it's reassuring that I got the same answer.\n\nI think I've got it. The value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, the total value is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Each time, I'm adding a layer, so starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, 9 layers. So, when I compute Layer 9, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1 + 3*4=13\n\na_3=1 + 3*13=40\n\na_4=1 + 3*40=121\n\na_5=1 + 3*121=364\n\na_6=1 + 3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 + 3*9841=29,524\n\nThen, the total is 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and it can be solved as follows.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSo, a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check that for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nOriginal expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nIf I denote the innermost expression as x, then each layer is 1 + 3*x. But since it's nested, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, but in the formula above, we found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29,524.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, that's similar to 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the ninth layer, which we've already computed as 29,524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just check once more to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. It's easy to miscount the layers or miscalculate a multiplication.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the method of solving the recurrence relation also led to the same result, so that reinforces that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. This leads us to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a second. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, the outermost expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built using the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. Since the expression has nine layers, that would correspond to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since our problem goes up to a_9, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. Just to be thorough, I can compute 3^10 directly: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Then, (59049 - 1)/2 is 59048/2, which is 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Let me see if that perspective helps. Starting from the innermost term, each time we have 1 + 3*(something). If we expand all the terms, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If we consider the number of layers, each layer adds another power of 3. So, after expanding, the entire expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but then multiplied by 3. Wait, let me think. Actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so when we expand, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which becomes 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Let me try to see how many terms there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one term. Then each layer adds another term. Since there are nine layers, perhaps the expansion would result in a sum from 3^0 up to 3^8, and then multiplied by 3. Let me check: 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). The sum inside the parentheses is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^8. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, n=9 terms (from 0 to 8). So, the sum is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, that's not matching my previous result. Hmm, so there must be something wrong here. Let me see. Wait, in this approach, I considered the expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). But in reality, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which when expanded gives a sum that goes up to 3^8, but the total expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). However, when I computed the layers step by step, I ended up with 3*(a_9) where a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. But according to the geometric series approach, the sum inside is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, and 3*9841 = 29523, which is different. There's a discrepancy here. Let me figure out why. Wait, perhaps the number of terms is different. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me see: Starting with the innermost 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's see: The expression is 3*(...), and inside, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is layer 2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), layer 3, and so on until layer 9. So, when expanding, each layer adds a term with 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=8, because there are 9 layers. Wait, but when I computed the sum as (3^9 - 1)/2, that would be from k=0 to k=8, which is 9 terms. Then, 3*(sum) = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = (3^{10} - 3)/2 = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523. But earlier, when computing step by step, I got 88572, which is 3*29524. Wait, so why the difference? It must be because the number of layers is actually 9, but the exponents go up to 3^9? Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step computation, the innermost layer was 1+3=4=3^1 +1. Then, each layer was 1 + 3*previous. So, the first layer is 3^1 +1=4, the next is 3*(4)+1=13=3^2 + 3 +1, the next is 3*(13)+1=40=3^3 + 3^2 + 3 +1, and so on. So, each layer adds another power of 3. Therefore, layer n would be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is layer 1: 1+3=4=3^1 +1? Wait, no, 1+3=4=3 +1=3^1 +1. Then, layer 2: 1 +3*(4)=13=3^2 +3 +1. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1. So, each layer n corresponds to the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Therefore, layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k. Which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Ah, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. So, earlier, I thought the sum was up to 3^8, but actually, it's up to 3^9, because layer 9 corresponds to the sum up to 3^9. Therefore, the sum is (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{11} -3)/2=88572. That makes sense now. So, the confusion was about the number of terms in the geometric series. The key is that each layer adds another term, so with nine layers, we have a sum from 3^0 up to 3^9, which is ten terms. Therefore, the sum is (3^{10} -1)/2, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2=88572. So, both methods now agree, and I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or follows some recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear function. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, the original expression has 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, we compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer (n-1). This is a recursive relationship, which might be modeled by a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to find a general formula for Layer n. Since each layer depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, this is a linear recurrence relation. The standard form for such a recurrence is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, where k=3 and c=1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The general solution is a_n = A*k^n + (c/(k-1))*(k^n - 1), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let me check that. For our case, k=3, c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = A*3^n + (1/(3-1))*(3^n - 1) = A*3^n + (1/2)*(3^n - 1). Now, let's apply the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, plugging into the formula: 4 = A*3^1 + (1/2)*(3^1 - 1) = 3A + (1/2)*(3 - 1) = 3A + (1/2)*2 = 3A + 1. So, 4 = 3A + 1 => 3A = 3 => A = 1. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = 3^n + (1/2)*(3^n - 1) = (3^n)*(1 + 1/2) - (1/2) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Wait, let me compute that correctly. Alternatively, combining the terms: a_n = 3^n + (1/2)(3^n - 1) = 3^n + (3^n)/2 - 1/2 = (3^n)(1 + 1/2) - 1/2 = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me compute it again. a_n = 3^n + (1/2)(3^n - 1) = 3^n + (3^n)/2 - 1/2 = (3^n + (3^n)/2) - 1/2 = ( (2*3^n + 3^n) ) / 2 - 1/2 = (3*3^n)/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2, that's 29524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the general formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is a geometric series with ratio 3, but it's finite, so maybe we can express it as a sum. Let me try that. The expression for Layer 9 is 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1. Wait, because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so after 9 layers, the expansion would be 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1. That's a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and 9 terms. The sum of a geometric series is (r^n -1)/(r -1), so here it's (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's Layer 8, right? Because if Layer 1 is 1+3, then Layer 2 is 1+3*(1+3), which would be 1 + 3 + 9, which is 13. Wait, but according to the formula, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 1 is (3^2 -1)/2 = 4, Layer 2 is (3^3 -1)/2 =13, and so on. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, which is correct. So, the sum approach gives me Layer 9 as 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572. So, that's consistent. I think I've verified it enough ways. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let me find D first. Assuming a steady-state solution, where a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9: a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572, which matches my earlier computation. So, that's another way to arrive at the same answer, using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without doing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, so each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis looks like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1.\n\nI can solve this using standard techniques for linear recurrences.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to nine layers, right? Because each time I see a (1+3(...)), it's a new layer.

So, the final step is: Final Answer: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step. 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\nThen, 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7.\nNext, 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\nThen, 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carried) = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\nFinally, 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carried) = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572.

Okay, that seems correct. Let me just verify the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive formula where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is L_n = (L_1 - b/(1 - a)) * a^{n} + b/(1 - a).\n\nWait, let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the general solution is L_n = a^{n-1}*(L_1) + b*(a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nWait, let me check that. Alternatively, the closed-form solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, in our case, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, if we consider L_1 as the first term, then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9.\n\nBut maybe it's better to index it starting from L_0. Let me try that. Let\u2019s define L_0 = 1. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_0 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found as follows.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 0, L_0 = 1.\n\nSo, 1 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=0: L_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, giving L_1=4.\n\nWait, but in the problem, we have 9 layers. Let me clarify: The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer8, and so on, down to Layer1=1+3.\n\nSo, in terms of the formula, Layer1 corresponds to n=1: L_1=(3^2 -1)/2=4.\n\nSimilarly, Layer2 corresponds to n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=13.\n\nContinuing up to Layer9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, correct. So, 3^{10}=59,049. Then, (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nOkay, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, the expression can be thought of as a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nBut since we've already solved it using the recursive approach and verified with the closed-form formula, I think we can be confident that the result is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost. The recurrence relation for each layer is:\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\]\nwith the initial condition \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\nUsing the recurrence relation, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\). Therefore, we compute:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Hmm, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

Wait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...\" is a layer. So starting from the first 3, each subsequent 1+3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is \"1+3\", then each layer adds another \"1+3(\", so how many layers are there? Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the first one adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nI can see that there are 9 layers of \"1+3(...\", each nested inside the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). So, my initial approach was correct, computing each layer from 1 to 9, and then multiplying the result by 3. So, the final result is 88572.

Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down: 29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I added correctly when computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, each step is correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3*(something). So, if the innermost is Layer1, then each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one, and finally, we multiply the outermost result by 3. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can express this recursively or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence relation into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSubstitute a_{n} = A*3^{n} + B:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To double-check, let me compute a few layers using the closed-form formula to see if it aligns with my previous calculations.\n\nFor example, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches.\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, which matches.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using a recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Define Layers**: Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost:\n   - \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Each subsequent layer is \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\)\n\n3. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation is \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\n4. **Closed-Form Solution**: Solving the recurrence, we find:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   For \\(n = 9\\):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Computation**: Multiply the outermost 3 with \\(a_9\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} + D = 3C + D. I need another equation to find both C and D. Let's compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = C*3^{2} + D = 9C + D. So now I have two equations: 1) 3C + D = 4 2) 9C + D = 13 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9C + D) - (3C + D) = 13 - 4 => 6C = 9 => C = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug C back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + D = 4 => 9/2 + D = 4 => D = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, actually, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). From my calculation, Layer 9 is 29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572, so adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me double-check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, that should give me the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let's define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did before. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B.\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nEquate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract B from both sides:\n\n0 = 1 + 2B.\n\nSo, 2B = -1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, A = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let me try to find B. If I assume that a_n approaches a limit as n approaches infinity, then in the limit, a_n = a_{n-1} = L. So, L = 1 + 3*L. Solving for L: L = 1 + 3L => 0 = 1 + 2L => L = -1/2. Hmm, but our layers are positive numbers, so maybe this approach isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and starting from a_1 = 4, we can compute each term as above. Alternatively, we can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, that's interesting. It looks like each a_n is 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^{n} ? Wait, let's check: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3. a_2 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9. a_3 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. a_4 = 121 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81. Wait, 1+3=4, 4+9=13, 13+27=40, 40+81=121. So, each a_n is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, up to 3^{n}. Specifically, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that formula. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 = 59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute it step by step by expanding the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is linear and has constant coefficients, so we can solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume that the particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5:\n\nL_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6:\n\nL_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7:\n\nL_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8:\n\nL_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for all the layers. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's another way to get the same result. So, that confirms the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
