    "text": " Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but maybe there's a pattern or formula here that I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Assume a particular solution is a constant B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n in terms of n, to avoid computing each layer manually. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Simplify: C*3^{n} + D = C*3^{n} + 3D + 1. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 3D + 1. Then, -2D = 1, so D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^{1} + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to see if that's possible. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Wait, but actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that with 1 + 3*previous. But perhaps I can model the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me think. Let me denote the innermost expression as x1 = 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is x2 = 1 + 3*x1. Then, x3 = 1 + 3*x2, and so on, up to x9. Then, the entire expression is 3*x9. So, each x_i = 1 + 3*x_{i-1}, with x1=4. As I found earlier, x9=29524. So, 3*x9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for x_n, which I did earlier, so x_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, x_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, all these methods point to the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me set c such that 1 = 3*c - c, which would make it homogeneous. Wait, maybe it's better to approach it as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or using a formula, but given the small number of layers (nine), computing each step manually might be more straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is manageable. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can notice a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let's see: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That is, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer manually. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, and a_1 = 4. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n. Then find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, let's consider a smaller version of the problem. Suppose we have just 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that manually. Innermost: 1 +3=4. Next layer:1 +3*4=13. Next layer:1 +3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Alternatively, using the formula: n=3 layers. a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Then, 3*a_3=120. Which is correct. So the formula works for smaller n.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recursive sequence. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Let's see, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, then adding 1 and multiplying by 3, etc. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*something. So, if I have 9 layers, that would be 9 times I do this operation. But as we saw, using the formula, it's (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for n layers. So, with n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Let me try that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, expanding the entire expression, starting from the innermost: Let's denote S as the entire expression, so S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Wait, perhaps I can express S in terms of itself, but since there are 9 layers, it's a finite recursion, so maybe that approach won't directly help. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, which seems solid, I can rely on that. So, I think I've double-checked enough to be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series or recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >1. So, this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. I know that for such linear recursions, the solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), assuming a \u2260 1. Wait, but in our case, a=3, b=1, and L_1=4. Let me see. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{part} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 \u21d2 K - 3K =1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: At n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, L_2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to see it. Thus, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive sequence. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find another equation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so substituting into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, plug B = -1/2 into the first equation: 3A + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the total expression is 3*a_n, so total =3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, total = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, total=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula confirms the answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. Since the number of layers is 9, the outermost multiplication by 3 would correspond to n=9, so the value inside is a_9=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the manual computations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me denote each layer as a_i, where i goes from 1 to 9, with a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, the general formula for a_i is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_i, which would make computing each layer faster. The recurrence relation is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^i. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_i = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_i = A*3^i - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For i=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For i=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For i=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for i=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without going through each layer. Since each a_i is (3^{i+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, as we saw. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's test for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But wait, a_1 is actually 4 in our case. Hmm, maybe my initial conditions are different. Wait, in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a pattern. Let me compute the first few a_n: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, let's see if these numbers fit into a formula.

Let's test that. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=40, which matches a_3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=121, which matches a_4=121. So yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my previous calculation.

Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B: Assume a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to see if there's a recursive formula here. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve this recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer step by step, just to verify. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both methods gave me the same result, and I double-checked each step. So I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for a geometric series here. Let me see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with a_1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. But since I didn't know the formula initially, computing each layer step by step was a good approach. It might take longer, but it's straightforward. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence formula\u2014led me to the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 was 4, then a_2=13, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution instead of computing each layer. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear function. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which is probably faster. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrived at the same answer, I feel confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps we can find a general formula for a_n. Let me try to find a recurrence relation. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern, and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might have been more efficient, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. I think I've got it. The key was recognizing the pattern and then either computing each layer step by step or finding a general formula to compute the nth layer directly. In this case, both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I computed earlier, L9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Assuming L_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^k. Let me think. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's denote E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) But each inner expression is similar. Wait, but maybe it's better to think recursively. Alternatively, since we have a closed-form for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and in our case, n=9, so L9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, E=3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recurrence relation, and finding a closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Let's assume a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Simplifying, A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a recursive formula. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. So, the general formula for L_n is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. So perhaps a_0 = 1? Let's check. If n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. Given a_1 = 4, then 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, indeed, a_0 = 1. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found as a constant, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_0 = 1: 1 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = C - 1/2 => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.

Oh no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, 121 * 3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. So Layer 5 should be 1 + 363 = 364. Wait, but in my previous calculation, I had Layer 5 as 364, which is correct. So no mistake there. Wait, but in my head, I thought 3*121 was 123, which is wrong. So 3*121 is indeed 363, so Layer 5 is 364. Moving on. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093.

The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( starts a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)): The first ( is at the start, then each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's Layer 1.

Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: (1+3) Then Layer 2: (1+3(1+3)) Layer 3: (1+3(1+3(1+3))) And so on, up to Layer 9: the outermost one. So, yes, 9 layers in total.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is following a pattern. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Now, to find a general formula for a_n, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer. I think I've got it right.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1). Simplifying, that's (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Now, a_1 is 4, so plugging in: a_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying further: (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (3^{n+1})/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the linear recurrence, I end up with the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me verify one more layer. Let's take layer 5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2. 3^6 is 729. So, (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, all layers check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the prior one. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, I could compute 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me check that. 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence, or apply the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer L_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote the nth term as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c=3, d=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Let me check: If n=1, then a_1 = 3^1*a_0 + (3^1 - 1)/2. But we have a_1=4. So, 4 = 3*a_0 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. Therefore, 3*a_0 = 4 - 1 = 3 => a_0=1. So, a_n = 3^n*1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplify that: a_n = 3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is built by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, when you expand the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) and so on. If I expand it fully, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Which, when expanded, would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms, but actually, each term is nested, so it's more like a sum of 3^k terms. Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that each a_n is a sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=n, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. So, regardless of the method, whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation formula, or expanding the expression as a geometric series, I end up with the same final answer: 88572. I think I've verified it thoroughly, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. Therefore, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've solved it correctly by both iterative computation and by finding a closed-form formula. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n=9, but the entire expression is multiplied by 3, so maybe it's 3 times a geometric series? Let me see. Let me denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

    "text": " Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3) ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's a bit different. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. Then the entire expression is 3*L9. Let me see if I can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. Then, each subsequent L_n is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me see if this is a linear recurrence relation. Yes, it's a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + d, where d is the steady-state value. To find d, we set L_n = L_{n-1} = d, so d = 1 + 3*d. Solving for d: d = 1 + 3d => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check: n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches layer 2. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches layer 3. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the original expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. This looks like a geometric series, perhaps? Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572. So, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a geometric series.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about whether this expression forms a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, that's correct. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9 corresponds to a_9, which is (3^{9+1} -1)/2 = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which is correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as I found earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9, as I have. So, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me check that: 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3*3^{10} -3)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, I get 88572 as the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:  \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.
