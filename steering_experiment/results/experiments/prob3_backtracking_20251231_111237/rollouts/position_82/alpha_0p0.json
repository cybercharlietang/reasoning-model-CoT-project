Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can represent this as a sum. Let's denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a closed-form expression, I arrive at the same result as before. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4, and that this forms a geometric progression. The closed-form formula for such a recurrence is indeed a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which we derived.\n\nTherefore, computing up to n=9, we get a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it thoroughly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating each layer step-by-step or using the closed-form solution both lead to the same result. Multiplying the final layer by 3 gives the answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps for this problem, since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just to explore, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, computing each layer step by step would still lead me to the same result, albeit more slowly. But it's reassuring to see that both methods give the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for a_n. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a recursive relation. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found, perhaps, using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general form is L_k = a + b*L_{k-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = -1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, so rearranged, it's L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation would be L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, with characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = C*3^k. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_k^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When k=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer k is (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, k=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so 177147 -3=177144, then 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the geometric series. But regardless of the method, the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the formula approach gave me the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also works. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count them: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) So, from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have one more layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: The first opening parenthesis after 3 is for Layer 1: 1+3(...). Then each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: The expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), which has 9 opening parentheses because each layer adds one more. Wait, no, let me count. Starting from the innermost, the expression is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1). Layer3: 1+3(Layer2), and so on until Layer9: 1+3(Layer8). So that's 9 layers in total. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers that I can represent with a formula. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I computed before, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for a_n? Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer manually. That's a good check. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern. 2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses. 3. Alternatively, model the problem with a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to compute the nth term directly. 4. Verify the computations step by step and cross-check with the formula. 5. Multiply the outermost term by 3 to get the final result. I think I've covered all the steps and verified the computations sufficiently. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth layer. Finally, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to obtain the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1)*(r)^{n-1}, but wait, that formula applies when the recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. Let me confirm. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So the general solution is a_n = a_1*r^{n-1} + c/(1 - r). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 1, r = 3. So, applying the formula, a_n = 4*3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3) = 4*3^{n-1} + 1/(-2) = 4*3^{n-1} - 1/2. But let's check this with n=1: a_1 = 4. Plugging into the formula: 4*3^{0} - 1/2 = 4*1 - 0.5 = 3.5, which is not 4. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in applying the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different because our initial term is a_1, and the recurrence starts at n=2. Let me try again. The general solution for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - c/(1 - r). Let me test this. For n=1: a_1 = (a_1 + c/(1 - r)) * r^{0} - c/(1 - r) = (a_1 + c/(1 - r)) - c/(1 - r) = a_1, which works. So, in our case, r=3, c=1, a_1=4. So, a_n = (4 + 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(1 - 3) = (4 - 0.5) * 3^{n-1} - (-0.5) = 3.5 * 3^{n-1} + 0.5. Let's test this for n=1: 3.5*3^{0} + 0.5 = 3.5 + 0.5 = 4, correct. For n=2: 3.5*3^{1} + 0.5 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. But earlier, we computed a_2 as 13, which is different. Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps my formula is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula for the linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n. For the particular solution, since r \u2260 1, we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K = c/(1 - r). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*r^1 + c/(1 - r) => 4 = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3) => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => A = 1.5. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = 1.5*3^n + (-0.5). Simplifying, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches our earlier computation of a_2=13. Good. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches a_3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}/2 - 1/2) = (3^{11}/2 - 3/2) = (177147/2 - 3/2) = (177144)/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the linear recurrence, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me check if I can find a pattern or formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive expression. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as per earlier computation. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1, and each outer layer increments n by 1, so the outermost layer would be a_9, right? Because there are nine layers. Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is a_1. Then each layer wraps around, so the next one is a_2, up to a_9, which is the expression inside the first multiplication by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the linear recurrence, I arrive at the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) with n layers. Maybe we can find a formula for it. But in this case, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with nine layers. Let me try to see if each layer follows a pattern. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a recursive formula here. Each layer Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, since each layer is Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get there. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a pattern where Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, L9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems consistent. But wait, let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1, then each time we go out, it's another layer. So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So from the innermost: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the first 3. The expression ends with nine closing parentheses, I think. Let me see: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So from the start: 3(1+3(...)) where the innermost is (1+3). Each time we add another layer, so let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is 1. Then moving out, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a new (1+3(...)), and there are nine sets of (1+3(...)) inside each other. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that should be correct. Therefore, 3*(Layer 9) is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), assuming r \u2260 1. Wait, in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=1, r=3. But actually, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. So, the solution would be a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, a_0 would be the initial term. Wait, but in our case, the first term is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, maybe n starts at 1. Let's adjust the formula accordingly. If we have a_1 = 4, then a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't realize the recurrence relation, I could have noticed the pattern in the layers and computed each step as I did before, which also gave me 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows using a formula to find the result efficiently.

This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. We can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Then, a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p =1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer was 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, with each layer, we're applying the same recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So that's 9 layers, as we had before. Now, is there a closed-form formula for a_n? Let's see. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

That seems correct. But wait, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of 3(1+3(...)) parts: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 3(1+...). Let's count the number of 3s before the first 1+3. Wait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, each time we have a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the start: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of 3(1+... parts. Each time after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let's see: Starting with 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on. So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: The first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on until the innermost 1+3. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...). Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections. Each time we have a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)). Let me see: The first 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) is the outermost, then inside that is another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost is 1 + 3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: Each time after the 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( is after each 3. Let me count the number of 3s before each (1+3(...)). Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections. Let's see: The entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there's another 3*(...), and so on. So, each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we nest this 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 3s. Starting from the left: 3, then 3, then 3, and so on. Let me count them: 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside the parentheses. Let's count how many 3s there are before each (1 + 3(...)). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the initial 3, each (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3. The initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3: The first ( is after the initial 3, then each subsequent ( is inside the previous one. So, how many ( are there? Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (:\n\n1. After the initial 3: (\n2. Inside that: (\n3. Inside that: (\n4. Inside that: (\n5. Inside that: (\n6. Inside that: (\n7. Inside that: (\n8. Inside that: (\n9. Inside that: (\n10. Inside that: )\n\nWait, no, actually, let's count the number of opening parentheses. Each time we have a ( after a 3, except the very first one. Let me try again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it out with the parentheses:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 2. Then, inside that, the next ( is at position 5, then at 8, and so on. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. ( after 3\n2. ( after next 3\n3. ( after next 3\n4. ( after next 3\n5. ( after next 3\n6. ( after next 3\n7. ( after next 3\n8. ( after next 3\n9. ( after next 3\n10. ( after next 3\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost part is 1 + 3, which doesn't have a ( after it. Let me count the number of opening parentheses correctly. Each time we have a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of times (1 + 3 occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after a 3, we have (1 + 3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)). Let me count them:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost 3 is followed by (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s before each (1 + 3(...)). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is 9 because there are nine 3s in the expression, but that might not be accurate. Wait, actually, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left: 3, then 3, then 3, and so on. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3\n2. Then 3 inside the first parentheses\n3. Then another 3 inside that\n4. And so on until the innermost 3.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, so the number of 3s is equal to the number of layers. Let me think differently. Each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is the number of times this pattern repeats. Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + 3*(...) occurs. Starting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many times does this occur? Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one. The initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which contains another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of 3s in the entire expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of 3s is 1 (the first one) plus the number of 3s inside the parentheses. Each time, we have a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first 3\n2. Then inside that, another 3\n3. Then another 3\n4. Then another 3\n5. Then another 3\n6. Then another 3\n7. Then another 3\n8. Then another 3\n9. Then another 3\n10. Then another 3\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is just one 3. Let me try to count the number of 3s more carefully.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me write it out with the parentheses:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nNow, each time after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, the number of 3s is equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of times 3( occurs:\n\n1. 3( at the beginning\n2. Then inside that, another 3( after the first )\n3. And so on.\n\nSo, let's count the number of 3( occurrences:\n\n1. The first 3( is at the beginning.\n2. Then inside that, another 3( after the first ), which is the second 3(.\n3. Then inside that, another 3(, which is the third.\n4. Continuing this way, how many 3( are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3(:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's nine 3( occurrences. So, that would mean nine layers. Therefore, my earlier computation where I went up to Layer 9 is correct, and then the final step is multiplying by the initial 3. Wait, no, actually, the initial 3 is part of Layer 1. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. If there are nine 3( occurrences, that would mean nine layers, each starting with 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the total number of layers is nine. So, in my earlier computation, I computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But actually, if the initial 3 is part of Layer 1, then the total number of layers is nine, and the final result is 3*(Layer 9). So, my computation seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify the number of layers again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...) sections. Each time, after a 3, we have (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. Let me count how many times this happens:\n\n1. The first 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 3s:\n\n- The first 3\n- Then inside that, another 3\n- Then another 3\n- Then another 3\n- Then another 3\n- Then another 3\n- Then another 3\n- Then another 3\n- Then another 3\n- The innermost 3 in 1 + 3\n\nWait, that's ten 3s. But that can't be right because the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is just one 3. Let me count again.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach time after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so the number of 3s is equal to the number of layers plus one. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let's count the number of times 3( occurs. Each 3( indicates a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3( at the beginning\n2. Then inside that, another 3(\n3. Then another 3(\n4. And so on.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, nine 3( occurrences. Therefore, there are nine layers. So, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, my earlier computation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then the final result is 3*Layer9, but wait, no, actually, the initial 3 is part of Layer 1, so Layer 1 is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is the outermost layer. Therefore, after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost, we have Layer 9 = 29524, and then the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, my final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me verify the computation of each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the computations. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 is accurate. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if this forms a geometric sequence or something. Let me denote L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Now, let's see the ratio between each layer: L2 / L1 = 13 / 4 = 3.25 L3 / L2 = 40 / 13 \u2248 3.0769 L4 / L3 = 121 / 40 = 3.025 L5 / L4 = 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008 L6 / L5 = 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000 L7 / L6 = 3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000 Hmm, interesting. It seems like each layer is approaching a multiple of 3, but with some added 1 each time. Wait, but actually, each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: L_1 = A*3 + B = 4. Let's compute the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this without computing each layer, using the formula. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) =3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed using the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\). Using the formula derived from this recurrence, \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed until Layer 9, which equals 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see what the terms are: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Hmm, let's see if we can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier terms. For n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method to solve such recursions is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct, matches a_3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct, matches a_4. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original expression has 9 layers, the outermost one is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, that's 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which gives the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a formula for the nth layer and then applying it.

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I have nine layers. Starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and going out to Layer 9. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524=88572. Let me just see if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe recognizing a pattern or a geometric series. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for Ln. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r = 3, so homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. If I expand all the terms, it might form a geometric series. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step, but that might take a long time. Alternatively, since we've already found that L9=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572, I think that's correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps? Let me recall. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 =81-1=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which is what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, yes, each layer is following the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n can be expressed as a sum: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If I expand it, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Wait, but in our case, each a_n is built as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric series. But the closed-form we derived earlier already gave us a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. So, the total expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've covered all the steps, and even though it took a while to figure out the pattern and the closed-form formula, it helped confirm that each layer was computed correctly. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, especially with nine layers, so having a formula is really helpful. I just need to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes when computing the powers of 3 or the multiplication at the end. Let me double-check 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 29524*3: Let's compute 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524*3: 29524*3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6 +1=7, 5*3=15, 9*3=27 +1=28, 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Perfect.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check Layer 8 again: 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then 3*29524: As above, 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me think about how these layers grow. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. Then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a geometric sequence or something similar. Wait, let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursion. If I have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe for just 9 terms, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, I can find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: L(1) = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L(9) = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let's solve it. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.

That seems correct. Wait, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test that. So, assuming a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, so a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the final expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer. 2. Compute each layer step by step, labeling them for clarity. 3. After computing the innermost layers, proceed outward until reaching the outermost layer. 4. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3 as per the original expression. 5. Alternatively, derive a general formula using recurrence relations to find the result more efficiently. 6.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recursive sequence. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Now, maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let me see if this sequence follows a pattern or a known formula. Looking at the terms: L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, L_4 = 121, L_5 = 364, L_6 = 1093, L_7 = 3280, L_8 = 9841, L_9 = 29524. Hmm, let's see if each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let's check: L_2 = 3*L_1 + 1? 3*4 +1 = 13, yes. L_3 = 3*L_2 +1? 3*13 +1=40, yes. L_4 = 3*L_3 +1=3*40 +1=121, yes. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2}/2) -1/2= (9/2) -1/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for L_9, n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, using the formula, I can directly compute the result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, either method works. So, to recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I found a formula for the nth layer, which allowed me to compute the innermost layer and work my way out, eventually multiplying by 3 to get the final answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a geometric progression and used the formula for the sum of a geometric series. But since the recurrence was linear and straightforward, solving it that way was more direct. Either way, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Simplifying: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. That recurrence relation can be solved more generally. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a geometric series. Specifically, for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_0 + c/(k-1)) * k^n - c/(k-1). In our case, k=3, c=1. So the solution would be a_n = (a_0 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^n - 1/(3-1). But in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2=13, etc. Wait, actually, let's see: If we define the layers as a_1, a_2, ..., a_9, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 => A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Then, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula gave me the same result, so I feel confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the formula for the general solution of the recurrence relation, we confirm that the value of the innermost expression is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a function of the previous one. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 ... and so on up to L9. So, each Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Lk. Let me see. The recurrence is Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is Lk = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1 = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. But Lk is also equal to A*3^k + B. Therefore, A*3^k + B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. Subtracting A*3^k from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is Lk = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When k=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, Lk = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For k=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer k, Lk = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L9. So, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that solidifies the conclusion.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I can compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which would be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. The formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives me the value of each layer directly, which is much more efficient. So, using that, I found Layer 9 to be 29524, multiplied by 3 to get 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication once more: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., as I computed. I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. To find D, we can consider the steady-state solution, where a_n = a_{n-1} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. Alternatively, I can check the computation another way. Let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 +3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, that's Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, this confirms the answer again. I think that's solid. So, just to recap, I broke down the problem by computing each nested layer step by step, then noticed a pattern that allowed me to use a recurrence relation formula, solved it, and confirmed that the result matched my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, a_9 is the value we need before multiplying by 3. The general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms using the formula. If n=1, a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but that's not matching our a_1=4. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test that. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Yes, that matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Great, so the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10. Let's see, the original expression is 3*(a_9) where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's another way to look at it. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I end up with the same result: 88572.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence.

Let me consider the recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which also matches. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the recurrence relation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Plugging the general solution into this: (A*3^n + B) - 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 => A*3^n + B - A*3^n - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the solution. I think this method is more efficient because it uses the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, avoiding the need to compute each layer step by step, which could be error-prone, especially for more layers. But since this problem only has nine layers, computing each step was manageable, but using the formula is a better approach for scalability.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n=9\\), this results in \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see: The recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps using exponentiation or another pattern. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each time you go out a layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but not exactly because it's finite. Wait, but using the formula I derived, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for L_n and then multiplying by 3. So, all methods lead me to the same conclusion: the value of the expression is 88572. Therefore, I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try solving the recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but let me check that formula. The standard solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). So in this case, a_1 = 4, which is our base case. Let me see if I can adjust the formula accordingly. Let me let n=1 correspond to a_1=4, then for n layers, the value would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the correct approach because our first term is a_1=4, which is 1 + 3*1, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe I can model the layers starting from a_0. Let me try that. Let me define a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches the first layer. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches the second layer. So in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. Then, the solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, which is correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, correct. So yes, the formula seems to hold. So, if we have n layers, the value is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine layers ...))). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost expression is Layer 9, because each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and I count nine opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). But Layer 9 is a_9, using the formula. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. First, 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier calculation. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression using the formula. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without having to go through each layer manually. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the linear recurrence, I can compute the value much more quickly, especially if the number of layers increases. But for this problem, with nine layers, both methods work fine, but the formula is definitely more elegant and less error-prone once you recognize the pattern.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a formula for the linear recurrence relation, we can efficiently find the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). This can be modeled using a linear recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer. The recurrence relation is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the base case \\(a_0 = 1\\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n   The solution to the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Determine the Number of Layers:**\n   The original expression has nine layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3. Thus, we need \\(a_9\\).\n\n5. **Compute \\(a_9\\):**\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\frac{59048}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n6. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks like a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = (3*59048)/2. Let me compute 59048/2 first: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I think I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we compute the 9th layer as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
