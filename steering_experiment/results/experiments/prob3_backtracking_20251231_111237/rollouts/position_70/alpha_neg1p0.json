Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric progression but nested. In general, for an expression like a + a*r + a*r^2 + ... + a*r^n, the sum is a*(r^(n+1) - 1)/(r - 1). But in this case, each term is multiplied by 3, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define the expression recursively. Let\u2019s denote each layer as S_n, where S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and S_{n} = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}. So, S_1 = 4, S_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, S_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to S_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9. So, if I can find a formula for S_n, I can compute S_9 directly without calculating each layer step by step. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for S_n. The recurrence relation is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug this into the recurrence relation: S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1} Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is S_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition S_1 = 4. When n = 1: S_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: S_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: S_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: S_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, S_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit more involved. But using the recurrence relation and solving it gives me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern or used a formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Alternatively, this seems similar to a geometric series, but let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I have only nine terms, computing each step is straightforward. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also leads to the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer: 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Hmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression without breaking it into layers, step by step. Let me write the expression again and compute from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me start by evaluating the innermost 1 + 3 first. So, starting from the innermost parentheses: Compute 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result). So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer out: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recursive formula here. It's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is indeed 88572. Just to make sure, I can compute 3^10 directly: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing step by step, verifying each layer, and then using a formula approach, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this looks like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result for this problem.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me consider the general form. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n, and then the total expression would be 3*a_n. But in our case, we have 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let\u2019s plug in the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D So, left side: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Now, solve for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute 3^10 directly to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct. I think I've considered multiple approaches: computing each layer step by step, recognizing the recurrence relation, solving it using the method for linear recurrences, and then verifying with the closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result, so I don't think I made any mistakes here. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but 88572 is a pretty large number. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps recognizing a pattern or a formula that can simplify the computation instead of calculating each layer manually. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9, which is 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Then, the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using the formula. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer.

Then substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is 4, and we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So that's another way to get the same answer, using the formula for the linear recurrence. That's reassuring because both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value grows exponentially. Using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, we determine the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3( is a new layer. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each ( adds a layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the first 3( is followed by 1+3(...). Each time, it's another layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then moving out, each layer adds one. Let me count:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3: layer 1.\n\n- Next layer: 1+3(1+3): layer 2.\n\n- Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3)): layer 3.\n\n- Continuing this way up to the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each starting with 1+3 and wrapping the next layer. So, when I computed up to layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations again, because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps, which propagates through all the subsequent layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nSo, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 layers, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check: n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result without computing each layer manually, which is a good check.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I went through each step, checked my work, used both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods led me to the same answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4. So, L(1) = 4, L(2) = 13, L(3) = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L(2)=13: 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now plug A back into the first equation: 4 = (3/2)*3 + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*L(9). From the formula, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, maybe this is a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote the innermost expression as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait, this seems like a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so maybe we can find its solution. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, the initial term is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is the same as a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1. Similarly, a_3 = 3*a_2 + 1, etc. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation of order 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the innermost expression, which is a_1 = 4, but in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute a_9 first. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. This method is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. So, that's a good takeaway: recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form solution can save a lot of time and reduce the chance of errors. But in this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable, but it's still useful to see how the closed-form solution works. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't miss anything: 1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern. 2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses. 3. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution. 4. Use the closed-form formula to compute the value directly. 5. Multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer. I think that covers all the necessary steps. I'm confident that the answer is 88572 because both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result. It's always good to verify using two different methods to be sure.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, especially if the expression were longer. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I've verified it sufficiently, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Alternatively, I could recognize that this expression is a geometric series or something similar, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. Let me think if there's a formula that could have saved me time. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solve for K: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows us to derive a formula, confirming the result. The final computation gives the answer as 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to model this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, actually, in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9. So, in general, for such a recurrence, a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but in our case, a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe it's a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test that: For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches our first layer. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which is correct. So yes, the formula seems to be a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L_1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, so L_1 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, it's a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but since it's nested, the formula approach seems more straightforward.

Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be expressed as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, both by direct computation and by solving the recurrence relation. It seems solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods gave me the same answer. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value of the ninth layer to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step through each layer to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without going through each layer, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, this looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144 /2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way out. After computing all layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or look for a pattern. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. On the other hand, L_n = A*3^n + B. So, setting them equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.

So the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nWait, but let me confirm that Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 8 is 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct.\n\nThen 3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, without labeling layers, just computing each parenthesis as I go.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 +12=13.\n\nNext layer: 1 +3*(13)=1+39=40.\n\nNext: 1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use here, since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. Perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which would make computing the 9th term easier. Let me think about that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (since the innermost is 1+3=4). This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula also leads us to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, but since it's nested, it's a bit more involved. However, the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me verify the multiplication again: 29524 *3.\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 *3 can be computed as (30000 - 476)*3= 90000 - 1428= 90000-1428=88572. Wait, that's a different approach, but let me check:\n\n29524=30000 - 476.\n\nSo, 30000*3=90000.\n\n476*3=1428.\n\nThus, 90000 -1428=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all methods confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\nIn summary, by computing each nested layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation and closed-form formula, and checking the multiplication in multiple ways, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, we find the value of the expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Let me just confirm with another method. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series of sorts, but nested. Let me see if I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524*3: 20000*3=60000; 9000*3=27000; 500*3=1500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a formula to find the value of the innermost expression and then compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant. Let me try to find a particular solution. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Then substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Each layer adds another 3 times something. So, in terms of the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Wait, because a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So that's another way to look at it using the formula for the geometric series.\n\nBut since I've already computed it step by step, and both methods give the same result, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer. Using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use to compute this without calculating each layer individually, which would save time, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about this. Each layer seems to follow the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula where each term depends on the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, which is a linear recurrence. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence relation. The general solution is a_n = A*r^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let's find A and B. First, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. Let's consider n=0 as the innermost layer, which is a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no. Wait, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved some time by using the formula. But since the problem only had 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's good to know that both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: 1. Identified the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost layer. 2. Computed each layer step by step, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time substituting the previous result into the next layer. 3. After computing Layer 9, multiplied by 3 to get the final result. 4. Double-checked using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, which confirmed the result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find each layer's value. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier computations because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers are correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without expanding each layer, in case I made a mistake in the layers. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and this repeats 9 times. Wait, actually, in the original problem, how many times does the 1 + 3(...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), so each layer adds one more 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3. Then moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. From the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3. Then layer 2: 1 + 3(layer1). Up to layer 9: 1 + 3(layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, total layers inside are 9, and then the outermost 3. So, total layers: 9, and then multiply by 3. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or use recursion. Let me think about it recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). Then, the value we're looking for is 3*f(9). Let me verify that. If n=1, f(1)=1+3=4. n=2, f(2)=1 + 3*f(1)=1 + 3*4=13. Which matches what I had before. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for f(n). The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p. Plugging into the recurrence: f_p = 1 + 3*f_p. Solving for f_p: f_p - 3*f_p = 1 => -2*f_p = 1 => f_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, f(1)=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: f(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have n=9 layers inside, and then the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, let's compute f(9): f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the result I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm it's 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think I've checked it thoroughly enough. So, I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, either by expanding each layer step by step or by using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. Both methods led me to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we can work from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n- 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down layer by layer, I was able to compute each step without getting lost. It's like peeling an onion; each layer reveals the next step, and eventually, you reach the core, which in this case is the innermost 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer builds upon that, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. So, by methodically computing each layer, I avoided getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the expression. It's a good reminder that even the most nested and complex-looking problems can often be tackled by approaching them step by step, starting from the inside and working outward. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then 3*29524=88572. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Wait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence can be found by unfolding it. Let me try to compute a few terms: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's exactly what I did earlier. Now, to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write it as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see if that works. Let me assume that the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, using the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s say we have an expression like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let\u2019s denote L_k as the value of the kth layer, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this seems to follow a pattern where each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_k. The recurrence relation is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_k^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers: For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is k=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the value of the innermost expression is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a couple of the layers to ensure I didn't have any arithmetic errors. Let's check Layer 5: L_5 =1 +3*L_4. L_4 was 121. So, 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. All right, I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. It was a bit tedious computing each layer manually, but using the formula helped confirm that my step-by-step approach was correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to compute it without going through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. That's pretty efficient. But since the problem didn't specify whether to use a particular method, either approach is fine. But since the problem was given with nine layers, it's probably expected to compute each layer step by step, as I did initially. But knowing that there's a closed-form formula can be helpful for future problems of this type. So, in summary, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

I think I did that right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous equation would be a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. But since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each layer step by step was manageable. I think either method is fine, but recognizing the pattern and using the formula might be more efficient for larger numbers of layers. But in this case, with only nine layers, step-by-step computation is feasible. So, after all that, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.
