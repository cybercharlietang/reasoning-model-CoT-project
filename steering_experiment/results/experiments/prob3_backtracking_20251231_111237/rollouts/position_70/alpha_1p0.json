    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait a minute, let me check my earlier steps because the initial expression had nine layers, and when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, which was 1 + 3*9841. Let me confirm each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake along the way. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, each step checks out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, each layer is defined recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, actually, the standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0 - d) + d, where d = b/(1 - a). Let me check that. Let me recall the formula for the linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant if a \u2260 1, which it isn't here since a = 3. So, let's assume a particular solution L_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + K. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = C*3^1 + K = 3C + K = 4. But K = b/(1 - a) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2) = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me simplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. I know that 3^5 = 243, so 3^10 = (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243^2: 243 * 243. Let me compute this step by step: 243 * 200 = 48,600 243 * 40 = 9,720 243 * 3 = 729 Now, add them together: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. So, 3^10 = 59,049. Therefore, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Wait, that's 29,524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, using the formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that 88,572 is the correct result. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so if I expand it all the way, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to expand it step by step: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression without computing each layer, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula. Let me try to represent the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, it's 3 times a term that has nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps I can model this as E = 3*(1 + 3*E'), where E' is the expression with one fewer layer, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since each layer is defined as 1 + 3*previous, and we have nine layers, then using the formula we found earlier, the outermost expression is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Therefore, E = 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculations. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Let me just double-check my computations once more to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f All steps check out. Therefore, I can conclude that the computed value is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me check with a different approach to ensure I didn't make any mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 1 + 3, n2 = 1 + 3n1, n3 = 1 + 3n2, etc. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, in general, n_k = 1 + 3n_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for n_k. The recurrence is n_k = 3n_{k-1} + 1, with n_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is n_k - 3n_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say n_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is n_k = A*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: when k = 1, n_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is n_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer k, n_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values:\n\nFor k=1: n1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nk=2: n2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nk=3: n3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nk=4: n4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nk=5: n5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nk=6: n6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nk=7: n7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nk=8: n8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nk=9: n9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, n9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*n9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572. I think this confirms that my earlier step-by-step calculation was correct.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n------------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 8 8 5 7 2 \u2192 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.

Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Finally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2. So 88,572. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because when I computed Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer computation step by step to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. As before, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought of the layers, I thought there were nine layers, but when I started computing, I only went up to Layer 9, which was the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, each layer adds another set. Let's count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"1+3(...)\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(...), etc. Let me count: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So from the innermost, each time, it's 1+3, then each time wrapping around. So how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that, so starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see: The expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), so let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's count the number of \"(\" after the first 3: 1. Then each subsequent \"(\" adds a new layer. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So from the first \"(\", then each time we have another \"(\", so how many \"(\" are there? Let's count: 1. Then another \"(\", that's 2. Then another, 3. Then 4,5,6,7,8,9. So total of 9 \"(\" after the initial \"3(\". So that means there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). So my initial computation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then the final result is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29,524, giving 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the layers again, but this time in a table to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's make a table where each row represents a layer, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, and compute each step carefully.\n\nLayer | Calculation | Result\n-----|-------------|-------\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 1 + 12 = 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 1 + 39 = 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 1 + 120 = 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 1 + 363 = 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that looks correct. Each layer is computed correctly based on the previous one. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding all the parentheses, but that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or some pattern that might allow a formula. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, starting from L(1) = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => Subtract 3A from both sides: -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula confirms that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding all the layers would give a sum of 3^k terms. But since each layer is built upon the previous one, it's a bit more involved, but the closed-form approach worked well.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$.\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$.\n3. Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$.\n4. Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$.\n5. Layer 5: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$.\n6. Layer 6: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$.\n7. Layer 7: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$.\n8. Layer 8: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$.\n9. Layer 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$.\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, maybe? Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both methods gave me the same result, and I double-checked each step. So, yeah, that's how I would solve this problem.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression was 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. But let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer step by step again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might save me from computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. I can try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous plus particular. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each time, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times the pattern (1+3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then Layer 2: (1+3(1+3)). Then Layer 3: (1+3(1+3(1+3))). Wait, so each Layer n adds another (1+3(...)) inside. So, if I have 9 layers, it's 9 sets of (1+3(...)). Therefore, the formula I used earlier is correct, with n=9, leading to L_9=29524, and the final answer being 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me notice that each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, if I let x = 1 + 3*(something), then the expression becomes 3*x. But in this case, the \"something\" is the next layer. Alternatively, since each layer is similar, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of itself. Wait, but since there are 9 layers, it's a finite number, so perhaps the geometric series approach is more straightforward. Wait, considering that each layer is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier, so for n=9, L_9=29524, and E=3*L_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 threes. But perhaps that's overcomplicating it. Alternatively, using the formula for a finite geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, and we have a finite number of terms, maybe I can model it as a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to express this as a sum. Let me denote the innermost term as T_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then T_2 = 1 + 3*T_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. T_3 = 1 + 3*T_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to T_9. Then E = 3*T_9. As we calculated earlier, T_9=29524, so E=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Each time, the 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. Let me try to expand E:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me expand this step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me denote the innermost part as S:\n\nS = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*S))))))))\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think recursively. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*next_expression. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's the same as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the recurrence relation, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers manually again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in my earlier calculations.\n\nCompute E_1 to E_9:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, E = 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost term, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 8 layers above it), and each subsequent 1 is multiplied by a lower power of 3.\n\nWait, let me think. Each time you go one layer out, the exponent decreases by 1. So, the innermost 1 is in Layer 1, which is multiplied by 3^8 in the final expression. Then the next 1 is in Layer 2, multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is in Layer 9, multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nWait, let me try to model this. The entire expression can be written as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nWhich can be expanded as:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me see.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Because each time you have 1 + 3*(...), so when you expand it, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nExpanding each layer:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) + 3*3^2*(1 + 3*(...)) + ... + 3*3^8*(1 + 3)\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting too convoluted. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nSince each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, and the previous_layer is itself a sum, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's consider that when we expand the expression, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of times it's nested. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0.\n\nWait, let me try to write this out:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nIf I expand each (1 + 3*...), it would be:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3*3^8*1\n\nBut wait, that would be a geometric series where each term is 3^k, from k=1 to k=9, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me check:\n\nWait, actually, when you expand the expression, each 1 is at a different level of nesting. The first 1 is at the innermost level, multiplied by 3^8, because it's inside 8 layers of 3's. The next 1 is at the next level, multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0.\n\nWait, so the total sum would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) \n\nWhich can be represented as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))...)))))\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nIf I have n layers, then the sum would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with n layers. Each 1 is multiplied by 3^(n - k), where k is the layer number. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each time you have a 1 plus 3 times the next layer, and each layer is similar, perhaps the entire expression can be written as a sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=8, multiplied by something. Wait, perhaps I can find a formula for the sum.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me denote S as the sum inside the expression, so:\n\nS = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWhich is S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next layer. But since all layers are similar, S' = S'' = ... = S_9. Wait, but this might not be helpful since we have a finite number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, since we have 9 layers, maybe S can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, from earlier, we found that E = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 *3 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, E = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a more straightforward way. So, if I can model the expression as E = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2, where n is the number of layers, then for n=9, E=(3^{10} - 3)/2. Wait, but earlier I had E=3*L_9, where L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so E=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me verify that:\n\n3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, another way to write the expression is E=(3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nThis approach might be more efficient if the number of layers is large, as it avoids computing each layer individually.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and cross-checking with a geometric series approach, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern that can be modeled using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the outermost expression is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, did I compute each layer correctly? Let me double-check my earlier steps because it's easy to make a mistake in these nested computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's see, each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for Layer n. The recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1, with Layer 1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the values. For n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, I can set up a system of equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, plug A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, the innermost Layer is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, Layer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, the formula confirms the step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way to compute this without going through each layer, especially since it's a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but with each term also adding 1. Hmm, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression.\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nIf I expand E, it would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) As I computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express E as a sum: Each time, you have 3 multiplied by a term that is 1 plus 3 times another term. So, maybe this is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me think recursively. Let me define E(n) as the expression with n layers. So, E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), with E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12? Wait, no, actually, E(1) would be just 3*(1 + 3) = 12, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, and then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)/3). Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the initial problem, the entire expression is E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I denote the inner expression as E', then E = 3*(1 + E'). But E' is similar to E but with one fewer layer. So, E' = 3*(1 + E''). But this might not be the best approach because each time we have an extra 3 multiplier.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as a recurrence where each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me try to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers). Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, so Layer 9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 3s inside. Let me see how many 3s are there. Each layer adds a 3, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3. Wait, perhaps the number of 3s is equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3s: Starting from the innermost, each layer has a 3, and there are nine layers. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3. Wait, perhaps it's 3^10 - something.\n\nWait, actually, when I computed Layer n, it was (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Let me try.\n\nIf I expand the expression E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let's expand it step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me distribute the 3 at each step:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) \n\nWait, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each layer adds a term that is 3^k, where k is the layer number. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, using the formula I found earlier, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express E as 3*( (3^10 - 1)/2 ) = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me check: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct. So, E = (3^11 - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nThat's a neat formula. So, without computing each layer, I can directly compute E as (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For example, if n=1, E=3*(1 + 3) = 12. Using the formula: (3^(1+1) - 3)/2 = (9 - 3)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, so maybe my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula applies differently. Let me see: For n layers, the expression would be 3*(Layer n), where Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, E = 3*( (3^(n+1) - 1)/2 ). For n=9, E = 3*( (3^10 - 1)/2 ) = (3^11 - 3)/2. So, that's correct for n=9. But for n=1, E would be 3*( (3^2 - 1)/2 ) = 3*(8/2) = 3*4 = 12, which matches the actual computation for n=1. So, the formula E = (3^(n+2) - 3)/2 when n is the number of layers. Wait, for n=1, E=12, which is (3^3 - 3)/2 = (27 - 3)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Correct. For n=2, E=3*(Layer 2) = 3*13=39. Using the formula: (3^4 - 3)/2 = (81 - 3)/2 = 78/2 = 39. Correct. For n=3, E=3*40=120. Formula: (3^5 - 3)/2 = (243 - 3)/2 = 240/2=120. Correct. So, yes, the formula E = (3^(n+2) - 3)/2, where n is the number of layers. Since in our problem, there are nine layers, n=9, so E = (3^11 - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly without expanding each layer. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable and confirms the result.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, yes, 3^11=177147. Then, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods, the step-by-step layer computation and the formula using the geometric series, give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Now add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, but wait a minute. Let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Maybe I miscounted the layers or miscalculated somewhere. Let me recount the layers step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Okay, that seems consistent. So each layer is computed correctly. Let me check Layer 7 again: 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 93*3=279; so 3,000 + 279 = 3,279; plus 1 is 3,280. That's correct. Layer 8: 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840; so 9,000 + 840 = 9,840; plus 1 is 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 841*3=2,523; so 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523; plus 1 is 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524: As above, 88,572. So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Good, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^{10}=59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59,049; 3^{11}=177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct result. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication once more. 29,524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7         3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Yes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. Let's try to find the closed-form solution for this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn = 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn = 6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn = 7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn = 8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works for all the layers I computed. Therefore, the closed-form solution is accurate. So, using this formula, I can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let's try that approach.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, expanding the expression might give a sum of terms that form a geometric progression.\n\nLet me try expanding the innermost parentheses first:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, but if I expand it all the way, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nLet me try to write out the entire expression step by step:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses and working outward:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using a different approach, perhaps by expanding each multiplication step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute the entire expression step by step without using the layers, just expanding each parenthesis as I go:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving outward, we have 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, that's the same result as before. I think I've done this correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series here. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, and the previous_layer itself can be expressed in terms of a geometric progression.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is multiplied by 3, so the expression is more like a geometric series with ratio 3, but with each term added before multiplying. Let me think about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a continued multiplication, leading to a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see that.\n\nWait, let's consider that each time we have 1 + 3*something. If I expand all the parentheses, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but if I expand each 1 + 3*... all the way, it would be:\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, if I expand all the parentheses, the expression becomes:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWhich, when fully expanded, would be:\n\n1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1 + 3^9*1.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each layer is 1 + 3*something, so when you expand, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k where k is the number of layers above it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model it as a geometric series where each term is 1 multiplied by 3^{k} for k from 0 to 9, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each time you have a 1 added, and then each subsequent 1 is multiplied by 3 for each layer it's nested in. So, for example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 8 layers above it), the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, the innermost 1 is at layer 1, and it's multiplied by 3^8 when it reaches the outermost multiplication. Similarly, the next 1 is at layer 2, multiplied by 3^7, etc., up to the outermost 1, which is at layer 9, multiplied by 3^0.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(...), so maybe each 1 is multiplied by 3^{n}, where n is the number of layers from that 1 to the outermost multiplication.\n\nWait, let me try to model it:\n\nThe innermost 1 is at layer 1, and it's inside 8 more layers, so when it's multiplied by 3 eight times, it becomes 1*3^8.\n\nSimilarly, the next 1 at layer 2 is inside 7 more layers, so it becomes 1*3^7.\n\nThis continues until the 1 at layer 9, which is the outermost, so it's multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nSo, the total sum inside the outermost parentheses would be the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, because each 1 is multiplied by 3^k where k is from 0 to 8.\n\nWait, let me check: sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, that's the value of a_8 in my earlier computation. But in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841 = 29523, but that's not matching my previous result. Wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which, when fully expanded, is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = 3*(19682/2) = 3*9841 = 29523. But that contradicts my earlier result of 88572.\n\nWait, this can't be right because earlier, when I computed each layer, I ended up with 29524 before multiplying by 3, leading to 88572. There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I model the innermost expression as sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, then multiply by 3, I get 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^{k+1} = sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k = (3^{10} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, because sum from k=1 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 3)/2.\n\nSo, in this case, sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k = (3^{10} - 3)/2 = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523.\n\nBut earlier, I had 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = 3*(19682/2) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, so according to this, the total expression is 29523, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step computation where I ended up with 88572. There must be a mistake in how I'm modeling the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of terms. Let me try to expand the expression manually to see how many terms there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so according to this, the sum is 88572, but when I tried to model it as a geometric series, I got 29523. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me count the number of times the expression 1 + 3(...) appears. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: there are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, layer 1 is the innermost 1 + 3, layer 2 is the next one, up to layer 9, which is the outermost. So, when I computed layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572.\n\nBut when I tried to model it as a geometric series, I considered sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which gave me 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the geometric series approach. Let me try again.\n\nIf I have the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers, then expanding it would give me:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nWhich would expand to:\n\n3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1.\n\nWait, that's because each 1 inside is multiplied by 3 once for each layer it's nested in. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, etc., up to the 1 at layer 9, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is 3*(...), so each 1 inside is multiplied by 3 once more. Let me think carefully.\n\nWait, actually, each time you go one layer out, you multiply by 3 again. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times (since there are eight layers above it) before being multiplied by the outermost 3, making it 3^9. Similarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3 seven times before the outermost 3, making it 3^8, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^1.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that each 1 is multiplied by 3 for each layer above it, including the outermost multiplication. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 nine times (since there are nine layers, including the outermost 3), making it 3^9. The next 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times, making it 3^8, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3 once.\n\nWait, but that would make the sum inside the expression equal to sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 3)/2 = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523. Then, since the entire expression is 3 times that sum, which would be 3*29523 = 88569, but that's not matching my earlier result of 88572. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to model it properly.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so when expanded, it's 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1.\n\nWait, because the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^9, the next by 3^8, and so on, up to the 1 at the first layer, which is multiplied by 3^1.\n\nWait, so the sum would be sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k = (3^{10} - 3)/2 = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = 3*(19683 - 1)/2 = 3*19682/2 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but this is conflicting with my step-by-step computation where I got 88572. There must be a mistake in the geometric series approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of terms. Let me check: the original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, when I expand it, how many 1s are there?\n\nEach layer adds another 1, so there are nine 1s in total. Each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the power of the number of layers above it.\n\nSo, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nWait, but then the sum would be sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier step-by-step result of 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me go back to my step-by-step computation. Each layer was computed as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so according to this, the sum inside the expression is 29524, and the total is 88572.\n\nBut according to the geometric series approach, it's 29523.\n\nThere's a discrepancy of 1 between these two results. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the geometric series approach is missing a term or miscounting the exponents.\n\nWait, let me think again: when I have nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), each 1 is at a different depth. The innermost 1 is at depth 9, so it's multiplied by 3^8. The next 1 is at depth 8, multiplied by 3^7, etc., up to the outermost 1, which is at depth 1, multiplied by 3^0.\n\nSo, the sum inside the expression is sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(sum) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut according to my step-by-step, the sum inside is 29524, and the total is 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the geometric series approach because the expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k), which is 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = 3*(19682/2) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, the sum inside is 29524, which is 9841 + 1? Wait, no, 9841 + 1 is 9842, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a term in the geometric series approach. Let me check.\n\nWait, in my step-by-step computation, I had nine layers, each adding a 1 multiplied by 3^k where k starts from 0 up to 8. So, the sum inside is sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I ended up with 29524 before multiplying by 3, which suggests that the sum inside is 29524. But according to the geometric series, it should be 9841.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check my step-by-step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the sum inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, which is a_9.\n\nBut according to the geometric series approach, the sum should be 9841, but that's a_8. So, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers in the geometric series approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the step-by-step approach computes each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, up to a_9 = 29524. So, the sum inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = 29524, which is then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut the geometric series approach was trying to model the sum inside as sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is 9841, but that's a_8, not a_9. So, perhaps the correct sum inside is a_9 = 29524, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my step-by-step.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the mistake in the geometric series approach was that I was considering the sum up to 3^8, but actually, it's up to 3^9, because the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^9.\n\nWait, but no, in the expression, each 1 is at a certain depth. Let me clarify:\n\nEach time you have a 1 + 3*(...), the 1 is at a certain level. The innermost 1 is at level 1, and it's multiplied by 3^{9 - 1} = 3^8.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost 1 is at level 9, so it's multiplied by 3^{9 - 1} = 3^8.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step, the innermost 1 is at layer 1, which is the innermost, and it's multiplied by 3^8 when it reaches the outermost multiplication.\n\nSo, the sum inside the outermost parentheses is sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, but according to the step-by-step, it's 29524, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so perhaps the confusion is that the sum inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to recognize that the sum inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've spent enough time verifying this, and all methods point to 88572 as the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer's result by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   Compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step because sometimes when doing nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, using the closed-form expression confirms that the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all layers, we multiply the final result by 3 to get the answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4.

Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate anywhere.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Hmm, but wait, let me check the number of layers again because sometimes when you count layers, you might miscount. Let me recount the number of parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3\n\nWait, so there are nine sets of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. So, that would mean there are nine layers, which is what I computed earlier. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed correctly. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this expression using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write down the recursive formula:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is Ln = a + b*Ln-1, where a = 1 and b = 3 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is Ln = a*(b^n - 1)/(b - 1) + initial term.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrence relations. For a recurrence relation of the form Ln = a + b*Ln-1, with L1 = c, the solution is Ln = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + c*b^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let's take n=1: L1 = c.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = a + b*c\n\nFor n=3: L3 = a + b*(a + b*c) = a + b*a + b^2*c\n\nFor n=4: L4 = a + b*(a + b*a + b^2*c) = a + b*a + b^2*a + b^3*c\n\nSo, in general, Ln = a*(1 + b + b^2 + ... + b^{n-1}) + c*b^{n-1}\n\nWhich can be written as Ln = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + c*b^{n-1}.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 3, and c = L1 = 4.\n\nWait, but L1 is 4, which is 1 + 3, so yes, c = 4.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nLn = 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) + 4*3^{n-1}\n\nSimplify:\n\nLn = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 4*3^{n-1}\n\nWe can simplify further:\n\nNote that 4*3^{n-1} = (4/3)*3^{n} = (4/3)*3^{n}\n\nBut let me express both terms with denominator 2:\n\n(3^{n} - 1)/2 + (8*3^{n-1})/2\n\nWait, because 4*3^{n-1} = (4/3)*3^{n}, which is equal to (8/6)*3^{n} = (4/3)*3^{n}, but maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, let's write both terms with denominator 2:\n\n(3^{n} - 1)/2 + (8*3^{n-1})/2 = [3^{n} - 1 + 8*3^{n-1}]/2\n\nBut 8*3^{n-1} = (8/3)*3^{n}, so:\n\n[3^{n} - 1 + (8/3)*3^{n}]/2 = [ (1 + 8/3)*3^{n} - 1 ] /2 = [ (11/3)*3^{n} - 1 ] /2 = [11*3^{n-1} - 1]/2\n\nWait, let's check that again:\n\n8*3^{n-1} = (8/3)*3^{n}\n\nSo, 3^{n} + (8/3)*3^{n} = (1 + 8/3)*3^{n} = (11/3)*3^{n} = 11*3^{n-1}\n\nTherefore, the numerator becomes 11*3^{n-1} - 1, so:\n\nLn = (11*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, the general formula for Ln is (11*3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging n=1: (11*3^{0} - 1)/2 = (11*1 - 1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. Wait, that's not correct because L1 is 4. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in deriving the formula.\n\nWait, let me go back. The general solution for Ln = a + b*Ln-1 is:\n\nLn = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + c*b^{n-1}, where c is L1.\n\nIn our case, a=1, b=3, c=4.\n\nSo, Ln = (1*(3^{n} - 1))/(3 - 1) + 4*3^{n-1}\n\nWhich is (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 4*3^{n-1}\n\nLet me compute this for n=1:\n\n(3^1 - 1)/2 + 4*3^{0} = (3 - 1)/2 + 4*1 = 2/2 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. But L1 is 4, not 5. So, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is slightly different because the initial term is L1, not L0. Let me adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nThe standard solution for such a recurrence starting at n=1 is:\n\nLn = a*(b^{n} - b^{0})/(b - 1) + c*b^{n-1}\n\nBut let me check a reference. The homogeneous solution is Lh = k*b^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant since a is a constant. So, the general solution is Ln = Lh + Lp = k*b^{n} + d, where d is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: Ln = a + b*Ln-1\n\nSo, k*b^{n} + d = a + b*(k*b^{n-1} + d) = a + b*k*b^{n-1} + b*d\n\nSimplify: k*b^{n} + d = a + k*b^{n} + b*d\n\nSubtract k*b^{n} from both sides: d = a + b*d\n\nThen, d - b*d = a => d*(1 - b) = a => d = a/(1 - b)\n\nIn our case, a=1, b=3, so d = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = k*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\nL1 = k*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3k - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for k: 3k = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => k = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the correct formula is Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked using the recursive approach and the closed-form formula, and both gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern defined by the recurrence relation Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. Using the closed-form formula for such a recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This looks like a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find another condition. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general formula, L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524 *3. Let me compute it again: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. 3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. 4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. 5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. 6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 8.

Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost expression as a base case and build up. Let me define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. So, a1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around that.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, that would mean that I have 9 layers, each starting from 1 + 3*(previous). So, computing layer1 to layer9 as I did before, and then multiplying the result by 3.\n\nWait, but when I did layer1 to layer9, I ended up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me check that step again because that seems high, and when multiplied by 3, it's 88572. Let me retrace my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let's go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's consider a general case where you have n layers of 1 + 3*(...). Let me define each layer recursively. Let\u2019s say L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, each layer Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches L1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, matches L2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct, matches L3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct, matches L4. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct, matches L5. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct, matches L6. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct, matches L7. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct, matches L8. For n=9: (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, matches L9. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is the innermost part of our original expression, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(29524) = 88572. Let me check if I can represent the entire original expression using the formula. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This forms a geometric progression, which can be solved using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. Applying that formula, I found that Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, I can compute the entire expression in one step using the formula (3^11 - 3)/2, which also gives 88572. Both methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recursive formula or recognizing the geometric progression, we find the innermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, add 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; so 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve it. First, write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the nonhomogeneous term is 1. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution a_n^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident about this solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this computation faster, especially if the number of layers increases. Each layer seems to be following a specific sequence. Let me see if I can find a recurrence relation or a formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4.

Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I've correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. So, L_1 to L_9. Thus, using the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*(L_9) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I went through each layer step by step, double-checked using a formula, and confirmed the arithmetic.

    "text": " 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, carryover 0, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, then subtract 476 * 3 because 30000 - 476 = 29524. Wait, no, 29524 is less than 30000. Alternatively, 29524 is 29524, so 29524 *3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add all these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to compute this without expanding each layer. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that's possible here. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with eight layers. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is just 1 + 3, so it's actually nine layers. Alternatively, maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on, up to a_9=29524, as we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, maybe I can solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 -1/2 = 27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Thus, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. This process is repeated nine times, leading to the innermost value of 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated, resulting in the ninth layer being 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. So, the general formula for each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. It might be possible to solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for L_n, which would then make computing L_9 much easier without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me try that approach. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, let's solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Next, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence relation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer. This method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. However, since the problem only has nine layers, both methods are manageable, but the recurrence relation is definitely more scalable. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is building up a number in base 3. Let me explore that idea. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). If I think of it as building a number digit by digit in base 3, where each digit is 1, and each position is multiplied by 3^n. Wait, let me think: If I have a number in base 3, say, d_k d_{k-1} ... d_1 d_0, then its value is d_k*3^k + d_{k-1}*3^{k-1} + ... + d_1*3 + d_0. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to appending a '1' digit in base 3. For example, starting from 1 (which is 1 in base 3), then 1 + 3*1 =4, which is 11 in base 3 (since 1*3 +1=4). Then, 1 +3*4=13, which is 111 in base 3 (1*9 +1*3 +1=13). Continuing this way, each layer adds another '1' in base 3. Therefore, Layer n would be a number with n '1's in base 3. So, Layer 1: 1 (base 3) =1 (decimal). Layer 2:11 (base3)=4 (decimal). Layer3:111(base3)=13 (decimal). Layer4:1111(base3)=40 (decimal). Wait, that doesn't quite match. Wait, Layer 1 is 4 in decimal, which is 11 in base3. Layer2 is 13 decimal, which is 111 in base3. Layer3 is 40 decimal, which is 1111 in base3. Wait, so Layer n is a number with n+1 '1's in base3. Because Layer1 is 11 (two '1's) in base3, which is 4 decimal. So, in general, Layer n is a number with (n+1) '1's in base3. Therefore, Layer9 would be a number with 10 '1's in base3, which is 1111111111 (base3). Let me convert 1111111111 (base3) to decimal. The value is 3^9 +3^8 +3^7 +...+3^0. That's a geometric series where each term is 3^k from k=0 to k=9. The sum of this series is (3^{10} -1)/(3 -1) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which again matches the previous result. Therefore, Layer9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, using the base3 interpretation also leads us to the same answer. It's fascinating how different approaches can lead to the same result. Each method reinforces the correctness of the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this forms a geometric series or follows a specific recurrence relation. Let's think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as computed earlier. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work fine. However, recognizing the pattern and deriving the closed-form formula is a useful skill because it can save time and reduce the chance of arithmetic errors when dealing with more complex or deeper nested expressions.

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88,572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can help generalize this. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n88572\n\nYes, because 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Is that correct? Let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo each layer is correct. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6 +1=7, 5*3=15, 9*3=27 +1=28, 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute 29524 * 3 is to break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without having to go through each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(the result from the previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nI wonder if there's a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see.\n\nThis recurrence relation is linear. It can be written as:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nOkay, this seems to hold. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the value of Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nSo, the expression is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer again.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. Let me check one or two layers again to be sure. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.

Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers seem correct. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps, both by direct computation and by deriving a formula to solve the recurrence relation.

    "text": " 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. When I computed Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*(Layer 8) where Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) which is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let's denote each layer as L_k, where k is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more generally. The recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^k + B = 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^k + 3B + 1. So, we have A*3^k + B = A*3^k + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^k from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, k=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way, using the formula for the linear recurrence. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, the recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Let's plug the general solution into the homogeneous equation first. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = A*3^n. The particular solution L_n^(p) can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^(p) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same number.

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => Subtract 3K from both sides: -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1 + 3(...\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting with 3(1 + 3(... So, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections. From the innermost: 1 + 3 is the first. Then each \"1 + 3(\" outside adds a layer. So, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. Let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. The innermost: 1 + 3 (this is layer 1)\n2. Next: 1 + 3(layer1) (layer2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(layer2) (layer3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3(layer3) (layer4)\n5.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression using the formula. Since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1. After computing all nine layers, the innermost value becomes 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). That's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see. The recursive formula is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: L(n) = A*3^n. Then find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. But either way, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. So, to summarize, the expression simplifies to 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recursive formula. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using the recursive relation, we determine that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting with 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have: For n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we have L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Because n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The standard solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, if I were to compute it using the formula, the final result is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let's see: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost layer is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, the value we need is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire computation using the formula: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} which is 3*3^{10}=3*59049=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.

The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since the innermost layer is layer 1, and we have 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using the formula. Since the original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same answer. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Anyway, I think I've verified it multiple ways, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward.

So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So yes, the calculations seem correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can model it that way. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. I know that for such recurrence relations, we can find a closed-form solution. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, our a_1 is 4, so perhaps a_0 would be 1? Let me check. Wait, maybe I should adjust the indices. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it differently. Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, a_1=4, and for Layer 9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, this method also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, regardless of whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.

Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Let's compute that: 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So 3*29524: 29524*3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be more efficient. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series. Wait, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, since this is a linear recurrence relation, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let's see. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's a much more efficient method. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and deriving the closed-form expression for a_n, we can quickly find the value of the entire expression.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait a minute, I notice that each L_n can be expressed recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I were to compute this using the formula for the entire expression, which is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula. But either way, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. So, I think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093. 1,000 * 3 = 3,000. 90 * 3 = 270. 3 * 3 = 9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000 * 3 = 9,000. 280 * 3 = 840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 800 * 3 = 2,400. 40 * 3 = 120. 1 * 3 = 3. So, adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think I'm confident with this result now. I didn't make any mistakes in the step-by-step computation, and the formula also confirmed it. So, yeah, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
