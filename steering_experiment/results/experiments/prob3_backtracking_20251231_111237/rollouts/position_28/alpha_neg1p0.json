    "text": " Layer 5 gives 364. Let's keep going. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the outermost expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I've double-checked it thoroughly, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Layer 5: 364? Wait, let me check that again. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, that's correct. Now, Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, that might not be the right way to break it down. Alternatively, I can compute it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number. Wait, maybe I should write it out properly. Let me write 29524 multiplied by 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 0 (since there are no more digits beyond 2 in 29524, but actually, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so after the 2, there's nothing else. Wait, but 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 ones. So, when multiplying by 3, the digits are: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (ones). So, starting from the ones place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7. Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, we have 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me check Layer 5 again. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*364. Let me compute that again. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093. Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280. Let me compute that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524. As before, that's 88572. So, each step checks out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => 2A = -1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9.\n\nWait, but actually, in our initial breakdown, Layer 1 was the innermost, and Layer 9 was the outermost. So, if n=1 corresponds to the innermost, then n=9 would be the outermost. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nBut wait, let me check. If n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches our earlier calculation. So, yes, that formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nBut if I think of each Layer as adding another power of 3, maybe I can express it as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see. Each time, we're adding 3 times the previous layer, which itself includes the sum of previous terms. So, perhaps the total sum can be expressed as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nLet me try to write out the entire expression without parentheses to see the pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 1 + 3 ...)))\n\nSo, each layer adds another 1 + 3*... So, if I expand Layer 9, it would be:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1, but wait, no, because each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so the coefficients are different.\n\nWait, actually, when I expand Layer 9, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 8). And Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7), and so on.\n\nSo, if I expand Layer 9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me test with Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40, but if I expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait, so each Layer n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nTherefore, Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is the formula we derived earlier.\n\nSo, Layer 9 would be sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, I arrive at the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula\u2014give me the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\).\n\n1.

Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; so 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step builds on the previous one, and I double-checked each layer's computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.

Maybe I can create a table to keep track of each layer:\n\nLayer | Calculation | Result\n-----|-------------|-------\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that. Starting from Layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9, which is the innermost part of the original expression, is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times that Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.

That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That's another way to check it, and it gives the same result. So, that seems solid.

    "text": " Layer 5 is 364. Hmm, this seems to be growing rapidly. Let me keep going. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, each layer is computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then using that in the next layer. This seems to follow a pattern where each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. Let me check if that's the case. Let me see: If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So yes, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. I remember that for such recursions, there's a formula to compute the nth term without calculating each one step by step. The general form is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where r is the common ratio, and A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. For the non-homogeneous part, since the constant term is 1, we can assume a particular solution of the form A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3. Let me compute that step by step: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 - 1) = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 88572. Correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's it. It was a bit tedious computing each layer step by step, but using the formula for the linear recurrence made it much faster and reduced the chance of error.

So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try to find a pattern or a formula that could represent this without computing each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the arithmetic somewhere. Let me think about it. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find another equation. For n=2: L_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B = 13. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, B = -0.5. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect! The formula works for each layer. So, layer 9 is 29,524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution can be found as L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. So, L_n = 3^n * L_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Let me check. Let me set n=1: L_1 = 3^1 * L_0 + (3^1 - 1)/(3 - 1). We know L_1 = 4, so 3*L_0 + (3 - 1)/2 = 4. That is, 3L_0 + 2/2 = 4 \u21d2 3L_0 + 1 = 4 \u21d2 3L_0 = 3 \u21d2 L_0 = 1. So, the general formula would be L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Since L_0 is 1, this becomes L_n = 3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me simplify that: L_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth layer, starting from the innermost as n=1, is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. That matches the step-by-step calculation I did earlier. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} which is 177147. Then, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct result. Therefore, I think I've solved the problem correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, the final computation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me calculate that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*29,000 = 87,000 3*524 = 1,572 So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572 Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 3*29,524 should be 88,572, but maybe I made a mistake in the intermediate layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Correct.

Let's compute it properly. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without expanding each layer manually, in case I made an error in one of the steps. Let's consider the structure of the expression. It's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have a system of two equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substituting A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2,187 3^8 = 6,561 3^9 = 19,683 3^10 = 59,049 So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. That matches what I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think this makes sense. The nested structure creates a rapidly growing number because each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula helped confirm the result without manually computing each layer, which is error-prone. It's also a good example of how recognizing patterns and using mathematical formulas can simplify complex-looking problems.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n3.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assuming a particular solution is a constant, say C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct. So, the problem is solved, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can efficiently compute the result.

Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute that. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

    "text": " Layer 5 is done. Now, Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so adding them together gives 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 is 87000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 87000 + 1500 = 88500, plus 72 is 88572.

So, 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication. 29524 * 3. Let me compute it step by step: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, yes. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, yes. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make it easier, but since I only have nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. Let me see if there's a pattern in the numbers. The layers go: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute it without calculating each layer. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given that a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's write the homogeneous solution first. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. But since I had to compute each layer anyway to get the value for a_9, the closed-form formula is a nice shortcut, especially if there were more layers. But for nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recheck a few layers. Starting with Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29,524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 88,572. Correct. Alternatively, 29,524 *3: 29,524 *3 = (30,000 - 476)*3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That's another way to compute it. So, yes, 88,572 is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous result.

So, the final computation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72.

Wait, that seems off because 29524 is 29,524. Let me check that multiplication again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it together, it's 88,572. Wait, 29,524 *3 is indeed 88,572 because 30,000*3=90,000, subtract 486 (since 30,000 - 29,524=476, and 476*3=1,428, so 90,000 - 1,428=88,572). Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. I computed each layer step by step, which took me from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time calculating the value correctly. Then, I multiplied Layer 9 by 3 to get the final result. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, it might not be a straightforward geometric series, but rather a recurrence relation. Let me see if that's the case. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, my approach seems valid.

By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, which equals 29,524, the entire expression is 3 times this value. Multiplying 29,524 by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 29524 * 3. I can compute this by multiplying each digit by 3 and carrying over as needed. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572.

So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, adding all those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the total is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula for a_n, which could be faster than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} to check. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=(177144)/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get there using the formula. Either way, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation formula approach gave me the same result.

So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer grows exponentially because we're multiplying by 3 each time. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, that seems correct. Each step is just taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. It's like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me think if there's a formula for such a sequence. If I have a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then the general solution can be found using the method for linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = -1/2. But since our initial term is 4, which is not -1/2, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. That matches our earlier result for Layer 9. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm that the answer is correct. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might also help, but in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one with a multiplicative factor, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward.

Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. I think I did this correctly. So, the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached. Finally, the entire result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2.

Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Because the original problem is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29,000 is 87,000. 3*524 is 1,572. So, adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, let me verify that because 29524 * 3.

So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Then, 3 times the last layer, 29524, gives 88,572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is tripling the previous one and adding 1, so it's growing exponentially, which is why it gets so large so quickly.

I don't see any arithmetic errors here. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. Then, the recurrence relation would be:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we need a particular solution, a_p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume a_p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_h + a_p = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's test this formula with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct)\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 (correct)\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 (correct)\nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 (correct)\nFor n=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 (correct)\nFor n=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 (correct)\nFor n=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 (correct)\nFor n=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 (correct)\nFor n=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 (correct)\n\nPerfect! The formula works for each layer. So, the value at layer 9 is 29524, and then we multiply this by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nThis confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. It's reassuring to see that both methods lead to the same answer. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a geometric progression. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula, the result is found to be 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.

So, Layer 6: 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7: 3280.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me think again. Did I compute all the layers correctly? Let me recount from the beginning to ensure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as 1 + 3*previous term. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let me think about solving this recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 =0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D +1 => D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4. So, when n=1, L_1=4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result now. I didn't make any calculation errors, and the formula approach also gives the same answer. So, yeah, 88,572 is the correct value of that expression.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern defined by a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine the value of each layer and ultimately compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This creates a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let L_n represent the value of the nth layer. The relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence relation gives L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute Each Layer**: Using the formula, compute each layer up to n=9:\n   - L_1 = 4\n   - L_2 = 13\n   - L_3 = 40\n   - L_4 = 121\n   - L_5 = 364\n   - L_6 = 1093\n   - L_7 = 3280\n   - L_8 = 9841\n   - L_9 = 29524\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, I can break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500. 88,500 + 60 is 88,560. 88,560 + 12 is 88,572.

Let's compute 3*364 first. 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.

Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any errors along the way. Let me go back through each layer quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern that might allow me to compute it more efficiently, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined based on the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's the correct solution. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation can make the problem easier, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation was manageable. I also checked each step to ensure there were no arithmetic errors, which is a good practice to avoid mistakes. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 result: 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 result: 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 result: 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the multiplication because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward. Alternatively, let's compute it digit by digit: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 6 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me confirm: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach confirms the result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Layer 5 is 364. Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Yes, that's correct. Moving on to Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So adding those up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down differently would be better. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me go back through each layer again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly. Maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Now, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this recursion with a formula. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^{n} + D.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D\n= 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2.\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n9/2 = 3C\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using this formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=9 corresponds correctly. Since the innermost layer is a_1, and each layer out is a_2 up to a_9. So yes, the outermost layer is a_9, which is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be thought of as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 3*59049 = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nThis seems consistent, so I'm more confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers again to see if I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so 900+192=1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number.

    "text": " Layer 5 is 364. Hmm, okay, so each layer is getting significantly larger. Let me continue this process. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, wait a minute. The entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, once I compute Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without doing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let me write down the general form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, Layer 1 was 1 + 3 = 4, so a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Perfect! So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives me the correct value for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is a_9, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer:88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step or using the derived formula, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 5: Wait, that seems a bit high, but let's check: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, that's correct. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if that's the case. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*a1, and so on up to a9. Then, the expression is 3*a9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed as a geometric series. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, putting it all together: 6 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, but since it's 29,524, that's 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476*3). 476*3 is 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Wait, that's different from my previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try that again. 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the digits are 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that gives me 88,572. Which matches the previous method. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.

So, all the steps check out. I think that's the correct answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step worked well. I didn't try to find a formula or anything because it's only nine layers, so computing each one individually was manageable. If it were more layers, maybe I'd look for a pattern or a recursive formula, but for nine, this method suffices.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 result: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.

Wait, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method to be sure. Maybe using a different approach. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. So, 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers.

Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

Wait, but let me check once more for any possible arithmetic errors, especially in the multiplication steps because that's where mistakes often happen.\n\nWait, another way to compute 3*(1 + 3*(...)) is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a first-order linear recurrence, the solution can be written as a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to compute each term as I did before, but perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula to compute a_n without computing each step.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to compute a few more terms to see if there's a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as we can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let's test it. For n=1, a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, so that's not matching. Hmm, maybe that formula isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's solve the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer (Layer 9):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. So putting it all together: 27, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, that's right. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think my answer is correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) which is three layers. Compute it step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Outermost: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, compute directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, that doesn't match my previous step-by-step. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, in the three-layer example, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then outermost is 3*13 = 39. But if I compute directly, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, that's different. So, that suggests that my step-by-step method might be wrong. Wait, but in the three-layer example, if I compute the innermost first, I get 4, then 13, then 39. But when I compute directly, I get 120. That's a discrepancy. So, that means my approach is flawed. Hmm, that's concerning. Let me figure out where I went wrong. Let me re-examine the three-layer example. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then moving out, it's 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then the outermost is 3*13 = 39. But when I compute directly, I get 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, that's not matching. So, which one is correct? Let me compute it manually. Let me compute the innermost parentheses first: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(13) = 39. But when I compute it directly, I get 120. That's inconsistent. So, which one is correct? Let me compute it step by step without breaking it into layers. Let me compute the innermost parentheses first: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving outward, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(40) = 120. Wait, so in the three-layer example, there are three layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, actually, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Then layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Then the outermost 3*(40) = 120. So, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong because I thought there were only two layers inside the outermost 3, but actually, it's three layers. Therefore, in the original problem, which has nine layers, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so I need to make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. So, in the three-layer example, the expression is 3*(layer3), where layer3 = 1 + 3*layer2, layer2 = 1 + 3*layer1, and layer1 = 1 + 3. Therefore, in the original problem, we have nine layers inside the outermost 3*(...), each being 1 + 3*(next layer). Therefore, my initial approach was correct in the original problem, but I misapplied it in the three-layer example. Wait, no, in the three-layer example, the outermost is 3*(layer3), and layer3 = 1 + 3*layer2, layer2 = 1 + 3*layer1, layer1 = 1 + 3. So, in the three-layer example, we have three layers inside the outermost 3. So, in the original problem, we have nine layers inside the outermost 3. Therefore, when I computed the original problem, I correctly went through nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, in the three-layer example, I should have gone through three layers, but I only went through two, which led to the confusion. So, in the three-layer example, layer1: 1 + 3 = 4, layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 3*40 = 120. So, that's correct. Therefore, in the original problem, going through nine layers is correct. So, my initial computation was correct, leading to 88572. To be thorough, let me check another smaller example to confirm. Let's take a two-layer example: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Compute step by step: innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Outermost: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, compute directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. So, that's correct. So, in the two-layer example, it works. Similarly, the three-layer example works when computing all three layers. Therefore, in the original problem, computing nine layers is correct, leading to 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think my answer is correct. Just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's see. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is defined by this relation. So, for n layers, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Therefore, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in the original problem, we have nine layers. Therefore, the innermost layer is layer1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Then layer2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which is correct. Layer3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer9, is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, this formula confirms that the value is indeed 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence relation gives a general formula for each layer, and computing up to the ninth layer yields 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. That's right. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me compute that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Wait, that's 88,572, but I thought it was 88,572. But earlier, I had 88,572. Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 88,572, but when I broke it down, it's 88,572. So, both ways, it's 88,572. Hmm, maybe I wrote it as 88572 without the comma, but it's the same number. So, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression had nine sets of parentheses, right? So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote the layers as a1, a2, a3, ..., a9, where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and an = 1 + 3*a(n-1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a(n-1). This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a(n-1) = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a9, we have a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, since a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, I can quickly compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work. I think I'm satisfied with this solution. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula for the nth term. I think that's it. The answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. Using a recursive approach, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Recognize the nested pattern where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9):\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3.

    "text": " Layer 5 result is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*29524 = 3*(29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, wait a second, let me verify that. Maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Then, the outermost 3 multiplies Layer 9. So, that should be correct. But let me double-check the calculations for each layer to ensure there's no arithmetic error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically, and I double-checked each multiplication to ensure accuracy. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Layer 5: Wait, that seems a bit large. Let me double-check my calculations so far. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems correct. Let's proceed. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 Let me compute that. 3*29,524: Let's break it down. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, but 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 3*29,524 = 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572 Wait, let me compute it directly to make sure. 29,524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nThat seems correct. Each layer's computation builds on the previous one, and the numbers increase exponentially because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is significantly larger than the one before, which is why the numbers get so big so quickly. It's a geometric progression, essentially. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, which is a linear recurrence relation. I remember that kind of sequence from math class. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Solving such a recurrence can be done using standard techniques, but since I'm computing it step by step here, it's easier to just compute each term manually as I did. Alternatively, I could have found a closed-form formula for the nth term, but since I'm only dealing with nine layers, computing each step was manageable. Let me just confirm that I correctly applied the operations each time. For example, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. That's correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29,524 = 88,572. All right, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
