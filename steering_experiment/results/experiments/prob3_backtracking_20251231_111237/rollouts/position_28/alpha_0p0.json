So, 29524*3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I do arithmetic step by step, I might add wrong somewhere. Let me verify each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Suppose I define a sequence where each term is given by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, for n=1: a_1=4, n=2: a_2=13, n=3: a_3=40, and so on, up to n=9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down for accuracy. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again quickly to verify: Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems consistent. Each step checks out, so I think 88,572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it without expanding each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, expanding them step by step seems manageable. But just for fun, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula here. Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation formula, we arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think I've solved it correctly. The key was recognizing the pattern and either expanding each layer step by step or finding a general formula for the nth layer. Since the number of layers isn't too large, expanding step by step was feasible, but having the formula is useful in case the number of layers is much larger. Either way, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3 to get the answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, that checks out. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a mistake in the calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. I computed each layer one by one, from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiplied the result by 3. Each step involved simple multiplication and addition, which I double-checked. The final multiplication by 3 also seems correct. I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have made this easier, instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, the innermost layer was a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric series. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches. Good, so the formula works. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, using the formula saves time and reduces the chance of error, especially with more layers. But since I only had 9 layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad either. It's good to know both methods. In summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same answer as when I computed each layer manually.

So, let's compute that: 3*(29524) = 88572 Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Hmm, that seems quite large, but each step seems to multiply by 3 and add 1, so it's growing exponentially, which makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a base case of a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this relation. So, if I have n layers, the value at each layer can be calculated using this recurrence. But in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, maybe the total number of layers is 9, starting from a_1 up to a_9, and then multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe I can find a pattern by computing the first few terms. Let me compute a few more terms beyond what I did earlier to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Now, to find a general formula for a_n, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243: 243*200=48600, 243*40=9720, 243*3=729. Adding them together: 48600 + 9720 = 58320, plus 729 is 59049. Correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking down 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. But actually, 29524 is 29000 + 524. So, 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Correct. So, all the computations check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute it differently to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. Each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. So, it's a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, is there a formula for such a sequence? Maybe, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, the expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For each subsequent layer, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the expression. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Let's see how many 3s are multiplied. Each time, we have a 3 multiplied by a term that includes another 3, except for the innermost term. Let's see: The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Let me try expanding it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we derived earlier, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you have 1 + 3*(...), it's similar to 3*(... + 1/3). But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the expression as a sum, maybe it's a geometric series. Let me try to represent it as such. Let's denote S = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me see if I can express S in terms of itself, but I think it's more complicated because each term is nested. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, as we did before, and we found a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, then S = 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each time you have 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try to write out the expansion:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3*3 = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait, so each time, you're adding the next power of 3. So, for layer n, you're adding 3^{n}.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nWait, but no, because in Layer 3, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 39. Hmm, but 39 is not equal to 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 3 + 9 + 27 = 39. So, yes, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Similarly, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, which is 1 + 120. 120 is 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120. So, Layer 4 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. So, each layer n is equal to 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be 1 + sum_{k=1}^{9} 3^k.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 3)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = 1 + (3^{10} - 3)/2 = (2 + 3^{10} - 3)/2 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is the same as we had earlier.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with all the methods I've tried.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern right away, I could have computed each layer step by step, as I did initially, and that also led me to the correct result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods I used all point to the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer adds another power of 3. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying 29,524 by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute it another way to confirm. 29,524 * 3 can be computed as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3. Let's compute each part:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n9,000 *3=27,000\n500 *3=1,500\n20 *3=60\n4 *3=12\n\nNow, add them all together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's the same as before. So, 3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, after computing the nested part as 29,524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. That seems right. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could have simplified this computation instead of calculating each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4. This is a recursive relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) +1 = A*3^n + 3B +1. So, comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1=4: L_1= A*3^1 + B = 3A -1/2 =4. So, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same as I computed earlier. Therefore, the nested part is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way or see if there's another approach. Alternatively, I could compute the expression from the inside out, step by step, as I did before, but that's essentially what I did already. Alternatively, using the formula I derived, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*L_9=88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Yeah, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, and the recursive formula aligns with the manual computations. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and use it to compute the next. Using a recursive formula, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Ultimately, the nested expression evaluates to 29,524, and multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, each layer is computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Each step depends on the previous one, so I can't skip any layers. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, yes. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, that's correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems solid. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we compute each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1.

So, the final computation is: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

It's easy to make an error with so many layers. Let me verify each layer again.

So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, the formula seems to hold. So, if I use this formula, I can compute a_9 directly without computing all the layers. Let's try that. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent as well. Therefore, using the formula, I can compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since in this problem there are only nine layers, both methods work. I think this problem was designed to test the ability to handle nested expressions and recognize patterns or recurrence relations. It's a good exercise in recursive thinking and mathematical induction, I suppose. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step or by finding a general formula using recurrence relations, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for n=9 gives a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 +12=88572. Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1, a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's compute this step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.

Okay, that confirms it. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each layer: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Each step seems to follow logically, multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. It might help to see if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, but since I only have nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Alternatively, this looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Maybe there's a recursive formula here. Let me think about that for a moment. Suppose we define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches Layer 1. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2. Continuing, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I only need up to a_9, computing each term step by step is straightforward. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for a_n can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. This makes me confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Okay, that seems consistent. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3(...): Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...), so how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 1+3(...). The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost: 1. 1+3 2. 1+3(1+3) 3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) ... Up to 9 layers because each additional (1+3) adds another layer. Wait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, each adding another (1+3). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3=4. Then layer 2: 1+3*4=13, and so on up to layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, in my earlier calculation, I went up to layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let's solve for B. When n=0, a_0 would be 1, but in our case, a_1=4, so maybe we can adjust the indices. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let's assume a particular solution is C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is a geometric progression. But since each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, the formula I derived applies. So, both methods lead me to the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated until the ninth layer is reached. The ninth layer is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72.

Wait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8.

Layer 7: 3,280. Layer 8: 9,841. Layer 9: 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. It all seems to add up correctly. I don't think I made any calculation mistakes, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a couple of the layers. Let's check Layer 4: Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 was 40, so 3*40=120. 1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, plus 3*1=3, so 363. 1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192. So, 900+192=1,092. 1+1,092=1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. 3*1,000=3,000, 3*93=279. So, 3,000+279=3,279. 1+3,279=3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,000=9,000, 3*280=840. So, 9,000+840=9,840. 1+9,840=9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,000=27,000, 3*841=2,523. So, 27,000+2,523=29,523. 1+29,523=29,524. Correct. Final multiplication: 3*29,524. As before, that's 88,572. So, all steps check out.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, Layer 4:121, Layer 5:364, Layer 6:1093, Layer 7:3280, Layer 8:9841, Layer 9:29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the result without computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar? Let me think about that for a second. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches Layer 3. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer computation and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result.

Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but I think it's correct because each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which can lead to exponential growth. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4 (correct). Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 (correct). Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 (correct).

Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a second. Let's define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's consider the homogeneous solution and find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Good. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. That's right. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Yes. Then, the total is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 *3 = 60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 88,572 is the total. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, I started from the innermost, which was Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer added another 3*(previous layer). So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, the recursion seems correct. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (nine), it's easier to compute each step manually. Alternatively, for a deeper understanding, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute one more layer using the formula. Let's say Layer 4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which is correct. So, the formula seems reliable. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, the final step is to compute 3 times 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems right. But wait, let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, when you have a repeated structure like this, it's a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence relation: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we get the same result, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, that gives 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any errors in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. Each step seems correct, so I think I did it right.

Wait, no, looking back, the expression starts with 3*(...). Let me check that again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers. Let me verify each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524. Now, if I look at the pattern, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). That's a linear recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution to this can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

Hmm, let me break it down: 3 * 29,000 = 87,000 3 * 524 = 1,572 So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572 Wait, but let me check that again because 29524 * 3 should be 88,572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... (1 + 3)...))). Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer. It's a bit faster, especially if there are many layers. But since in this problem there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable, but using the formula is more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward.

Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many digits. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nMultiply each digit by 3 starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait a second, let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that looks correct. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't skip any or make a calculation error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding those up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...), each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear?\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\nFrom the start, it's 3 followed by (1+3(...). So, each opening parenthesis after that adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, does that mean there are 9 layers? Or 8? Hmm, perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, let's see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting with 3(, then inside that is 1+3(, and so on, until the innermost is 1+3). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so that would make 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as 8 layers because the initial 3 is outside. But no, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine 1+3*(...) layers. So, 9 layers inside, each adding another 1+3*(...). So, my initial computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a_9 is 29,524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Since each term is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, we take the result from Layer 9 and multiply it by 3: Final result: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 * 29524.

Let's compute each digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is correctly calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that can be generalized, so instead of computing each layer manually, we can find a formula for the nth layer. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, I notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, it's a recurrence relation: a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1, with a(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1, with a(1) = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, a(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the entire expression in terms of the formula.\n\nSince a(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a(n), where n=9.\n\nSo, 3*a(9)=3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^11=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, the total is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then 1 + 3*40 = 121. 1 + 3*121 = 364. 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I did before. So, the ninth term is 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify the multiplication again: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct.
