    "text": " Let's see, the recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a particular solution. Let's find D. Suppose a_n = D, then substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step, or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Therefore, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, layer 3 was 40. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my calculations for any possible arithmetic errors. Especially in the multiplication step: 3 * 29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So adding up the products: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524 *3: 29524*3= (30000 - 476)*3=90000 - 1428=88572. Wait, that might be another way to compute it, but it's probably more error-prone. But since I already got 88572 through two methods, I feel confident that it's correct. So, the step-by-step solution is: Compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses, each time calculating 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. But we also have a_n = A*3^n + B. Therefore, equating the two expressions: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).

For n=0: Hmm, actually, when n=1, a_1 = 4. Let me think. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.

The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

The general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as a geometric series without recurrence. Let me see. Each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's expand a few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 Wait, I see a pattern here. Each a_n is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. Wait, no, let me check: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 a_2 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 a_3 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 a_4 = 121 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). So, for r=3, sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which matches the solution we got earlier. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches our earlier result. Therefore, whether computing step by step or using the formula, we arrive at the same answer.

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3 + B. We can solve for A and B. But since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found as a constant, say a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3 - 1/2 => C*3 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^{10} is 59049. So, 3^{10} -1 = 59048. Then, (59048)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with our earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, we can express the entire computation using exponents. Let me see: Since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, to make sure, I can compute 3^10, which is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 29524, then 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's consistent. So, I think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result.

Alternatively, for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^{n} * (a_0) + c*(k^{n-1} + k^{n-2} + ... + k^0). But in our case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} becomes A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's compute the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, for n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.

Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence, and using the formula I derived, it's efficient.

So, the pattern is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and each term is 1 more than three times the previous term.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula to compute a_9 directly, which is more efficient than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since in this problem there are only 9 layers, both methods work. The step-by-step method is straightforward, but the formula is more efficient and less error-prone for larger n.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this expression as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach a_n can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. From the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0\n\nBut wait, our initial term is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. If we set a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 =4, which fits.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k - something? Wait, let's see.\n\nActually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric series but with a multiplier.\n\nThe solution we found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, is a geometric series sum.\n\nIndeed, the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3 and n+1 terms is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches our formula.\n\nSo, that's another way to think about it: each a_n is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, for n+1 terms, divided by 2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, solving the recurrence relation, and recognizing it as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.

    "text": " Let's see. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = A*3 + B = 4. Let's find a general formula. Since each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant C. Then, plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, as we computed earlier. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly, which might have saved some time. But since the number of layers is manageable, computing each step is feasible. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).

Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Now, we have a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5.

Wait, actually, the standard form for such a linear recurrence is a_n = k + r*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = (a_0 - k/(r-1)) * r^{n} + k/(r-1). Let me see. Let me try to compute the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n = r*a_{n-1}, which has solution C*r^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (k=1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + r*A => A - r*A = 1 => A*(1 - r) = 1 => A = 1/(1 - r). So the general solution is a_n = C*r^{n} + 1/(1 - r). Now, applying initial condition a_1 = 4. So, for n=1, a_1 = C*r + 1/(1 - r) = 4. Let's plug in r=3: a_1 = C*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Alternatively, if I had noticed the pattern earlier, I could have used the formula to compute directly without calculating each layer, which would have saved time, especially if the expression were longer.
