Let's find D by setting the homogeneous part to zero. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^(p) = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, let's equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).

Also, for n=0, if we assume a_0 = 1 (since a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, so a_0 = (a_1 -1)/3 = (4 -1)/3 = 1). So, a_0 = 1. Plugging n=0 into the general solution: a_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. So now we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) A + B = 1 Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1: (3A + B) - (A + B) = 4 - 1 => 2A = 3 => A = 3/2.

Now, since we have 9 layers, let's check what n is. Wait, in our earlier computation, we had Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1, so Layer 9 would be a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since it's only 9 layers, computing each step was feasible. Just to make sure, let me verify one of the layers again. Let's take Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4. Layer4 was 121. So 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Similarly, Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't see the recurrence relation, just computing each layer step by step would also work, though it's more time-consuming. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable.

    "text": " The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*(3)^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for C and D. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => 0 = 1 + 2D => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which is correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. But given that I've already solved it using the recurrence relation and verified it, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct.

And since the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3 - 1/2 => A*3 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.

The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing to the general solution a_n = A*3^n + B, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. That's pretty cool because it avoids computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work fine. Alternatively, I could also think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the total sum would be a geometric series with ratio 3 and 9 terms, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.

So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let's test that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe a different formula. Let's see, solving the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} first, which is 59049, then subtract 1 to get 59048, divide by 2 to get 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the answer is the same. I think I've verified it sufficiently. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but since the expression is entirely multiplicative, it's easier to compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which confirms the result when computed step by step. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for C and D. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier computation.

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as Layer 1 is 4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so 9+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's another way to see it. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.
