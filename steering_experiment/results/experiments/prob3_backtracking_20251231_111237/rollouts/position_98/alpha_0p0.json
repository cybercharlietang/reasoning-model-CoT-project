    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let's find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Comparing both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 1 + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition.

When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. When n=0, let's consider a_0. Wait, but n starts at 1, so maybe we can find a pattern. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 more than three times the previous term. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for a_9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147.

But according to the general solution, a_n should also be equal to A*3^n + B. So, setting them equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

First, 3^{10} is 59049. So, 3^{10} -1 = 59048. Then, (59048)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I were to compute it using the formula directly: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

At n=0: Well, actually, the recurrence starts at n=1, so maybe it's better to write it as a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say C.

Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.

We can also look at the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, layer n has value (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute a_9: 3^10 is 59049.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without computing each layer, but since I already have the formula, that's probably the most efficient way.

Yes, because each layer adds one to the exponent, so after 9 layers, it's 3^{10}. Therefore, the final computation is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me see: 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.

For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches a_3. Perfect! So the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation of a_9 as 29524. Therefore, the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume that as n increases, the homogeneous solution (the term with A) dominates, but since we have a fixed number of layers (9), maybe we can compute it directly. Alternatively, let's compute a few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as before, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, if I want a formula for a_n, it's a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me test that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe it's a different formula. Let's consider solving the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and solving the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Also, as n approaches infinity, if the recurrence is stable, but in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3, it's growing exponentially. However, for finite n, we can find a pattern. Let me compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial conditions are all integers, so maybe this approach is complicating things, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the homogeneous solution is different. Alternatively, let's consider the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each time you have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's equivalent to 1 + 3*(some number), which is 3*(some number) +1.

Let me see: Starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 +1. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(3 +1) = 1 + 9 +3 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. But in terms of powers of 3, 40 is 27 + 9 + 3 +1, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we did before, seems more straightforward.

Let's find A and B. We can also compute a few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 4 = 3A + B a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 = 3A*3 + B = 9A + B a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 = 27A + B Let me set up equations using a_1 and a_2. From a_1: 3A + B = 4 From a_2: 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into a_1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, computing each layer step by step is still feasible since there are only nine layers.

Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate coefficients: For 3^{n}: A = A, which is always true. For constants: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value inside is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, because the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. Wait, no. Let's clarify: The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the value after 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers.

Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.
