I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recheck the multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to compute 29524 * 3 is to break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that also adds up to 88572.\n\nI think I've checked it enough times. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). We compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
