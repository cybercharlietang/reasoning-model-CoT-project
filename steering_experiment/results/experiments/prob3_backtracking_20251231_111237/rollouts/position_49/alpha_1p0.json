Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my layers because that's a lot of steps, and I might have made a mistake in one of them. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote the innermost expression as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To find a closed-form expression for a_n, we can solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = -1. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe can also find the homogeneous solution and particular solution, but maybe it's simpler to compute a few terms and see the pattern.\n\nCompute L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again because 3^{10} is 59049, right? Yes, because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243:\n\n243 * 200 = 48,600\n\n243 * 40 = 9,720\n\n243 * 3 = 729\n\nAdding them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9 is indeed (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, after all that, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each step, used a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, and confirmed the result. It seems consistent.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, 5; carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8; carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case there's a smarter way. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n} - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Wait, that seems odd because all our layers are positive integers, so a negative particular solution doesn't make sense here. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the particular solution. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the particular solution might not be a constant. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps using the method for solving linear recurrences with constant coefficients. The general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_{n} where n increases by 1 each time. The outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this result because both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same answer. It's also a good reminder of how recurrence relations can help solve nested expressions efficiently without having to compute each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. 29524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 more than three times the previous term. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume a particular solution L_n^p = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=1, then L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3, L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Since 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572, which is the same as I calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L_n, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods all confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Wait, that's not right because 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 2 (ten thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6. 9 (thousands): 9 * 3 = 27, so write down 7 and carry over 2. 5 (hundreds): 5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 (tens): 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. 4 (units): 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.

Hmm, but wait, let me verify with another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a - 1)). Let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, assuming a constant, is L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me denote S as the entire expression. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) But wait, the inner part is similar to S/3, because if I factor out the 3, the inner expression would be S/3. Wait, let me think. Let me denote the inner expression as follows: Let me define E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), and our original expression is 3*E. But E itself is similar to the original expression. Wait, but E is 1 + 3*(E'), where E' is another similar expression, but actually, E is the innermost expression. Wait, maybe it's better to model this as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me write out the expression with all parentheses: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of 3s. Each layer adds a 3 multiplier. There are 9 layers inside the first 3. So, the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another 3. So, perhaps this can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand the innermost part first. Let's denote each layer as follows: Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. As we saw earlier, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum. Let me try to expand it. Let me consider the innermost term first: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, finally, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series. Let me try to see the pattern in the layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I write out the expression E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers, then E = 1 + 3E', where E' is the expression with n-1 layers. But in our case, the entire expression is 3*E, where E has 9 layers. Wait, maybe I can model this as E = 1 + 3E', where E' is the expression with one fewer layer. So, for n layers, E_n = 1 + 3E_{n-1}. As we saw earlier, this leads to E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see: Each time we have a 1 added and then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the expression can be expanded as a sum where each term is 3^k. Let me try to see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait, so each layer adds another term of 3^k, where k increases by 1 each time.\n\nSo, Layer n would be the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, but wait, that's the sum of a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches our earlier formula. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms multiplied by 3. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each layer adds another 3 times the previous sum.\n\nSo, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I expand this, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4...))).\n\nWait, but I think the expansion would lead to a sum of 3^k terms, but perhaps multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the entire expression as 3 times a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see:\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with 9 layers inside.\n\nLet me try to express S as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with 8 layers inside the first 3.\n\nWait, but I think this approach might not be as straightforward. Alternatively, since we've already determined that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3 times the 9th layer, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, another way to look at it is that the entire expression is (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's consistent across all methods I've tried.

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, but wait, 29524 is 2 digits more? Wait, no, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify that 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify the layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the opening parentheses: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nContinuing until we have 9 layers, because the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...9 times...))). So, yes, 9 layers, which we computed up to Layer 9 as 29524. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost 3*(...), so yes, multiplying that by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1.\n\nSolving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nEach term a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nExpanding this, a_n =1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) )=1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this expansion, after k steps, a_n =1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k} *a_{n -k}.\n\nIf we keep expanding until we reach a_1, which is 4, then a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n *a_1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\na_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}\n\na_{n-1}=1 +3*a_{n-2}\n\nSo, a_n=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nSimilarly, a_{n-2}=1 +3*a_{n-3}, so a_n=1 +3 +3^2*(1 +3*a_{n-3})=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3*a_{n-3}\n\nContinuing this, after expanding m times, we get a_n = sum_{k=0}^{m} 3^k + 3^{m+1}*a_{n - (m+1)}.\n\nIf we keep expanding until m =n-1, then a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n} *a_1.\n\nSince a_1=4, this becomes a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^{n}*4.\n\nThe sum sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k is a geometric series with ratio 3, so it equals (3^n -1)/(3 -1)= (3^n -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^n -1)/2 +4*3^n= (3^n -1 +8*3^n)/2= (9*3^n -1)/2= (3^{n+2} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems different from the earlier formula. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, let's double-check. If I expand a_n as:\n\na_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}=1 +3 +3^2*(1 +3*a_{n-3})=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3*a_{n-3}.\n\nContinuing this, after expanding m times, a_n= sum_{k=0}^{m}3^k +3^{m+1}*a_{n - (m+1)}.\n\nIf I set m =n-1, then a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^{n}*a_1.\n\nSince a_1=4, this is a_n= (3^n -1)/2 +4*3^n.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^n -1)/2 + (8*3^n)/2= [3^n -1 +8*3^n]/2= [9*3^n -1]/2= (3^{n+2} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I used the recurrence, I got a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's test with n=1.\n\nUsing the expanded formula: a_1=(3^{1+2}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. But a_1 is supposed to be 4. That's a discrepancy. So, I must have made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the number of terms. Let me try again.\n\nWait, when I expand a_n, each step adds a term and multiplies the next a. So, for a_n, it's 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)). So, the number of 1's is equal to the number of layers. Wait, maybe I confused the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence solution, which gave me a correct result. Let me check that.\n\nEarlier, using the recurrence, I found a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, which correctly gave a_1=4, a_2=13, etc. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, I ended up with a different formula, which didn't match. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, as found via the recurrence.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is correct.\n\nThus, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo, 3*a_9= (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this multiple ways: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and using the geometric series formula. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 7 7 5 7 2 4? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. So, I think I did it correctly. Each layer builds on the previous one, and multiplying by 3 each time, adding 1. It's like a geometric progression, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Actually, this might be similar to a geometric series, but with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such a series. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3(a_{n-1} + c), which gives c = 3c, leading to c=0. Then, finding a particular solution, say a constant solution, but since 1 is a constant, maybe the particular solution is a linear function. Alternatively, using the method for linear recurrences, the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: n=1, which is 4, as we saw. Then, each subsequent layer increases n by 1, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the formula (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth layer. The outermost layer is the 9th layer, which gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. I think the key here is recognizing that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and each time, the value grows significantly because of the multiplication by 3. So, each layer is 1 more than three times the previous layer. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, which matches. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40, correct. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, since there are nine layers. So, if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might help. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K -3*K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n= C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1= C*3^1 -1/2=3C -1/2=4. So, 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Thus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result using a different method, which is reassuring. I think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4.

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nFirst, multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Wait, but 29524 has only five digits, right? Wait, no, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So when I multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nNow, since there are no more digits, the carry over 0. So putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but when I was computing Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc.\n\nWait, but actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recursion: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer follows a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider a_0, but since the problem starts at n=1, maybe it's better to find a pattern. Alternatively, we can write the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which reinforces that 88572 is the correct answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation.

So, digits are: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: Let's compute digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the computations. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Solving such a recurrence relation can give a closed-form expression, which might be easier to compute, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers to ensure it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as computed before. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's easy to see how it could become tedious with more layers. So, using the formula is a good approach. Let me just recap the steps: 1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression. 2. Notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). 3. Set up a recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. 4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for L_n. 5. Compute L_9 using the formula. 6. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. Alternatively, recognize that the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2, which simplifies to (3^{11} - 3)/2, leading to the same answer. Either way, the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Wait, let me verify that again. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841 * 3. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524, which is correct. Then 29524 *3=88572, as above. So yes, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1=4 can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution also leads us to the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that because when I did it step by step, I think I messed up the digits.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, I just thought, is the expression correctly parsed? Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me see: The innermost is (1+3). Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+\" terms. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n... Up to 9 layers, because each time we have a new \"1+3(\" until the 9th one. So, I think I correctly computed 9 layers, ending up with Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me write down the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but I just thought, is there a formula for this kind of nested expression? Maybe a geometric series or something like that. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find that Layer 9 is 29524. The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, putting it together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my computations because these numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.

So, 30000*3=90000, and 476*3=1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute one of the layers again to check. Let's pick Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, a small error can propagate. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct) So, I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would work. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. Let me denote the entire expression as S. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Alternatively, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. As I computed earlier, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Then, S = 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see. Each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier terms: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct) For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 (correct) For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 (correct) For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 (correct) For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 (correct) For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 (correct) For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 (correct) For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 (correct) For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 (correct) So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression S = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for a_n, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then S = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so S = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

So the result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify this multiplication. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, write 0, carry 1. 9 + 9 +1=19, write 9, carry 1. 2 + 2 +1=5, 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5 +5 +1=11, write 1, carry 1. 2 +2 +1=5.

So that would be 88572. Okay, that matches. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. I think I did each step carefully and checked each layer. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could compute this more efficiently instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time. Let's try to find a pattern. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem. I started by computing each layer step by step, then verified using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3.

Wait, I think I messed up the digits. Let me try again. Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. Wait, but 29524 is 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3=88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000=79048; 79048 + 9000=88048; 88048 + 500=88548; 88548 + 24=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can see that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each term can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1=1+3=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B +1 => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3=3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, but in our case, the layers go from 1 to 9, so let's check for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (81-1)/2=40, which is Layer 3. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, using both the iterative step-by-step method and the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, leading to a geometric progression. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's interesting how the numbers grow so quickly because of the multiplicative factor of 3 each time. If I had more layers, the number would become extremely large, but with nine layers, it's manageable. So, in summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward and computing each layer step by step, I determined that the value of the entire expression is 88572. I also verified this using the formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, which gave me the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Maybe I should just do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Because computing each layer manually is time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. If I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n, that would make this easier. The recursive formula is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1, with Layer 1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplifying, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^(2)-1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it more efficiently without manually calculating each layer. That's a good learning point for the future\u2014recognizing recurrence relations and solving them with closed-form expressions can save a lot of time. So, in summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or by finding a formula, the result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), which repeats 9 times.

So, each layer seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. But just to be thorough, maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with n layers. In this case, n is 9. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, for k from 2 to 9, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_k. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_k = c*3^{k} + d, where c and d are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_k = A*3^{k} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{k} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{k-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{k} + 3B\n\nNow, set the left and right sides equal:\n\nA*3^{k} + B = 1 + A*3^{k} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{k} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_k = A*3^{k} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify with a different method to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions.

Hmm, but let me confirm: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back and check if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a known pattern. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let's assume L(n) = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B = right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L(1) = 4. L(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term follows the pattern 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, we determine that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers up to Layer 9, we find its value to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution: The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula for L_n, I can compute it directly without computing each layer. So, that's a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step isn't too bad. But knowing the formula is useful for future problems. So, to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By working from the innermost layer outward, and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I was able to compute each layer's value step by step, and then finally multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the result. Alternatively, using the derived formula, I can compute the value directly. Both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next nested term})\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 0 * 3 = 0. Wait, no, the number is 29524, which is five digits: 2 9 5 2 4. So, multiplying each digit: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but earlier, when I was computing each layer, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, that seems right. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Starting from a_1=4, each subsequent term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression with ratio 3. The formula for the nth term of such a recurrence is indeed (3^{n} -1)/2, but wait, in our case, it's a bit different because the initial term is a_1=4, which is 1+3. So, perhaps the formula is slightly adjusted. But regardless, using the recurrence relation method gave me the same result as computing each layer step by step. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Let me just check the multiplication one more time to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 *3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let's go back step by step to ensure each layer was computed correctly.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify with another method. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence because of the constant term 1. The general solution will be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute it again using the formula. Since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3^{10} directly and see. 3^1 = 3 3^2 =9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. So, yes, 3^{10} is 59049. Then, Layer 9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract (30,000 - 29,524) * 3. Wait, that might complicate. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 20,000 *3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if each layer is built on the previous one, I might have messed up one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me check the original expression again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, I think my calculations are correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d73 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d73 =27000\n\n500 \u00d73=1500\n\n20\u00d73=60\n\n4\u00d73=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.
