    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572 Wait, let me verify that. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recheck each layer step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step, as that could throw off the entire result. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the multiplication by 3 at the end is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about this expression: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for solving linear difference equations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer can be expressed as \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the 9th layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 And so on. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, so a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Now, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with our step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing this pattern, we can compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we find that each layer \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer \\(a_9\\), this gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result.

So, 70000 + 18000 = 88000, 88000 + 900 = 88900, 88900 + 60 = 88960, 88960 + 12 = 88972. Wait, that's still not matching. I think I'm messing up the addition somewhere. Maybe it's better to stick with the digit-by-digit multiplication which gave me 88572. Alternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9, let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer is computed correctly. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing down each operation. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Now, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Then: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each step builds upon the previous one, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

So putting it all together, starting from the right: 2, 7, 8, 5, 7, 8, 7, 6. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to do it step by step. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, no carry over.\nThere are no more digits, so we're done.\n\nWait, that gives us 88572. But when I did it digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n- Ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and going out to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here, instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 was 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => 0 = 1 + 2K => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking at a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this expansion recursively, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n} * a_1\n\nBut wait, since a_1 = 4, which itself is 1 + 3. So, maybe this approach complicates things. Alternatively, the closed-form formula we found earlier is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead us to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression again, but this time, without computing each layer, but using the formula.\n\nWe have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and this happens nine times, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost was 1 + 3 = 4, which is the first layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, yes, nine layers in total.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way to look at it is that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine 1's inside. Hmm, no, actually, each layer has a 1 and a 3, but the number of layers is nine, so maybe the exponent is different.\n\nBut regardless, using the formula we derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=9 gives us a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer's computation because I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see if we can spot a pattern: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added constant. But in this case, since it's nested, it's a bit more complex. However, since we've already derived a formula for L_n, and confirmed it with multiple steps, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13, which is correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, the general formula would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n can be computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see: Let\u2019s assume that a_n = k*3^n + c, where c is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: k*3^n + c = 1 + 3*(k*3^{n-1} + c). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*k*3^{n-1} + 3c = 1 + k*3^n + 3c. So, equating both sides: k*3^n + c = 1 + k*3^n + 3c. Subtract k*3^n from both sides: c = 1 + 3c. Then, -2c = 1 => c = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = k*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = k*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3k - 1/2 => 3k = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => k = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n*    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nThen, the next digit is 9 (from 29524, which is 9 in the ten thousands place), so 9 * 3 = 27, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8.\n\nThere are no more digits, but we have a carryover of 2?

So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's nonhomogeneous, I can also find a particular solution. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence, so the solution can be found using the formula:\n\na_n = (a_1 + c/(r - 1)) * r^{n-1} - c/(r - 1)\n\nWhere r is the coefficient of a_{n-1}, which is 3, and c is the constant term, which is 1.\n\nPlugging in, we get:\n\na_n = (4 + 1/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3 - 1)\n= (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n= (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (3^{n+1})/2\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I computed each layer step by step, checked it with a formula, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3. 20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000. 9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000. 500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500. 20 \u00d7 3 = 60. 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Now, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is correct because 1,092 +1 is 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000\u00d73=3,000; 90\u00d73=270; 3\u00d73=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000\u00d73=9,000; 200\u00d73=600; 80\u00d73=240. So, 9,000 + 600 = 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: Let's break it down. 9,000\u00d73=27,000; 800\u00d73=2,400; 40\u00d73=120; 1\u00d73=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, multiply by 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. That seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define the layers more formally. Let\u2019s say that a_n represents the nth layer, where n is the number of layers. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can also compute a few terms to find another equation. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So now we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate B: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572. So, the formula confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. But since we already have a formula for a_n, and it's confirmed by both step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88,572. Just to recap, the process was: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result. 3. Identify a pattern and model it with a recurrence relation. 4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a general formula. 5. Use the formula to compute the value for the outermost layer. 6. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. 7. Verify all steps and computations to ensure accuracy. This methodical approach helps prevent mistakes and ensures that I understand the problem deeply, even if it's a bit complex. It's also a good reminder of how recurrence relations and geometric series can be powerful tools in solving nested or repeated problems. So, after all that, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This pattern forms a geometric series, which can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Solving the recurrence relation provides a formula to compute the outermost layer efficiently. Multiplying the final layer by 3 gives the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9:\n   - a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 29,524\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I think I've computed this correctly. Each layer was built upon the previous one, and I didn't skip any steps. It's just a matter of carefully computing each nested expression step by step. I was a bit worried about making a multiplication error, but by breaking it down and verifying each step, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute a_1:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as I computed earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. This gives me even more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way. Alternatively, I could model this as a geometric series or something, but given the time constraints, I think the step-by-step approach is fine.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1. But wait, in our case, a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe the initial condition is different. Alternatively, perhaps the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test that. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Yes, that seems correct. So, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I had recognized the pattern earlier, I could have used the formula instead of computing each layer manually. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, each layer builds upon the previous one correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a recurrence relation. Maybe this forms a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is 177147, subtract 3 gives 177144, divide by 2 gives 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we compute each layer's value step by step. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form formula, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 24 + 24 = 48, 24 + 24 = 48. 52 + 52 = 104. 95 + 95 = 190. 29 + 29 = 58. So adding them: 58000 + 19000 + 10400 + 480 + 48. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's see if that works. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

So, yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then +29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding each step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found as a constant, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the value before the outermost multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try computing it another way to confirm. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. Now, let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series with each term multiplied by 3, but since it's nested, the formula approach seems more straightforward. To ensure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, since the recurrence is linear and of order 1. The standard form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. Here, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n will dominate unless A is zero. However, in our case, each a_n is finite, so perhaps B is the steady-state value. Wait, actually, for a linear recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the steady-state solution is when a_n = a_{n-1} = a, so a = c + r*a, which gives a = c/(1 - r). But in this case, r = 3, which is greater than 1, so the steady-state solution would be negative, which doesn't make sense here because all our a_n are positive. Therefore, the homogeneous solution will dominate, and the particular solution is the steady-state. Let me try to find the general solution. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant solution, so let's assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? The expression is 3*(...), and inside there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence and finding a closed-form solution, I can compute the result more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step by step wasn't too bad. I think I've got the correct answer here, 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to be sure. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Then each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*4=13, 1 +3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that all checks out.

The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1. 1 + 3 = 4 2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. The recurrence L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1 is a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, the sum after n terms would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly what I derived. Therefore, using the formula is much faster and reduces the chance of error.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems too big. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8.

Wait, but let me verify using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that adds up correctly. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think I did that correctly. Wait, but let me check one more time because sometimes with so many layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me list each layer again with their values:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nYes, that looks consistent. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**: Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Work Outwards**: For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer):\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**: The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems off because when I compute 29524 * 3, it's actually 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 88572 is correct. Wait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing them. Let me go through each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression from the inside out without labeling the layers, to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could represent this kind of nested expression, which might help confirm the result. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). After computing each layer, we multiply the final result by 3. The computation proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Write down 8.\n\nWait, this seems like I'm miscalculating because 29524 is only 5 digits, so maybe I'm adding extra digits. Let me count: 29524 is 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, it should be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n2 (tens place) *3 =6 +1=7. Tens place:7.\n5 (hundreds place)*3=15. Hundreds place:5, carryover1.\n9 (thousands place)*3=27 +1=28.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.

Correct.\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is 1 +3*(Layer8). So I computed Layer9 correctly, then multiplied by 3. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or formula. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 +3, a_2=1 +3a_1, a_3=1 +3a_2, etc., up to a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\na_2 =1 +3*4=13\na_3=1 +3*13=40\na_4=1 +3*40=121\na_5=1 +3*121=364\na_6=1 +3*364=1093\na_7=1 +3*1093=3280\na_8=1 +3*3280=9841\na_9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssume a_p is a constant, so a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p =1 + 3*a_p => 0=1 +2*a_p => a_p= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1= C*3^1 -1/2 =3C -1/2=4.\n\nSo, 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values we have:\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (3^{11}-3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same answer. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value is computed and substituted into the next. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that accurately. 29524*3: Break it down digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So writing it from right to left: 2, 7, 8, 7, 5, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Therefore, the computation is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 29,000 * 3 = 87,000; 524 * 3 = 1,572; so total is 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88,572.

Yeah, that seems consistent. So, I think I did it correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward.

Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me recall how to solve such recursions. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - r*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation k - r = 0, so k = r. The homogeneous solution is A*r^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (c), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = c + r*B. Solving for B: B - r*B = c => B*(1 - r) = c => B = c / (1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c / (1 - r). Now, applying this to our specific case where c = 1 and r = 3. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + 1 / (1 - 3) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. Good. Now, since we have a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the closed-form expression gives the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that would be more straightforward. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. If I denote the innermost term as T, then each layer is 1 + 3*T, where T is the next layer. But this seems similar to the recurrence approach. Maybe another way is to expand the entire expression step by step, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, I can think of the expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this step-by-step expansion confirms the result again.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is essentially building up a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but since each term is 1 + 3*(...), it's a bit different.\n\nWait, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nLet me try that. Let me consider the innermost term and work my way out.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nLet me try to express S in terms of itself, but I'm not sure if that's possible because each layer is finite.\n\nAlternatively, since there are nine layers, each contributing a power of 3, maybe S can be expressed as a sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=10, but I need to check.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom the closed-form solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, S = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, S = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBecause 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*( -1/2 ) = -3/2.\n\nSo, S = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147.\n\nThus, S = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, another way to write the expression is (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88572.\n\nThis seems to be a more compact way to represent it, using exponents.\n\nSo, to recap, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence and solving it, I found that the expression can be written as (3^{11} - 3)/2, which simplifies to 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles: step-by-step computation, recognizing the recurrence relation, and expressing it as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the expression using another method, maybe by expanding all the parentheses and adding up the terms. Although that might be time-consuming, it could help verify the answer.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, this matches my previous calculations. So, even when expanding each layer step by step, I arrive at the same result. This consistency across different methods makes me very confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI could also use a calculator to compute each step, but since I don't have one handy, I rely on manual calculations, which I've double-checked. Each multiplication and addition seems correct, so I don't see any errors in my process.\n\nIn summary, by methodically working through each layer, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, and applying the closed-form solution, I determined that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So writing all the digits together: 7 (from the last digit), then 7, 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me write it down properly:\n\n     29524\n   x    3\n   -------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's a 5-digit number, but 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let's go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. It seems like there are nine \"1+3(\" layers, each nesting deeper. So, my initial approach of computing Layer 1 through Layer 9 is correct, with Layer 9 being the outermost one, which is then multiplied by 3. So, the computation seems accurate. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more formally. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But I want to make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers are correct. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let me solve it properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation which can be solved using the formula for such sequences. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think if there's a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K =1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 0.5 \u2192 3C = 4 + 0.5 =4.5 \u2192 C=4.5 /3=1.5=3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same result. This cross-verification gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. The formula I derived earlier is a direct result of solving the recurrence relation, which models this exact behavior.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same final value. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So the number is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add them: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without manually computing each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4. 2) 9A + B = 13. Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had to compute this without computing each layer, I could use the formula for L_n and then multiply by 3. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any errors in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve it. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer, which is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems off because when I compute 29524 * 3, I think I might have messed up the place values. Let me try again. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 9, so 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- The next digit is 5, so 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- The next digit is 2, so 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- Finally, the next digit is nothing, but the carry over is 1, so write down 1.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should just do it as 29524 * 3:\n\n- 29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Layer 9 was 29,524, so 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So that would be the final answer.

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1,093 is 3,279, right?

Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, there's a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 9 opening parentheses, each followed by a 1+3(...). So that would mean 9 layers, right? So from Layer 1 to Layer 9. But when I compute Layer 9, I get 29,524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88,572. But let me check online or with a calculator to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the equation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the recurrence relation approach. I defined a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which seems correct because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Then I solved the recurrence and found a closed-form formula, which seems solid. Plugging in n=9 gives me the same result as computing each layer step by step. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize a pattern where each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution and compute the result step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**:\n   - \\( a_1 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\)\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**:\n   - General solution: \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\)\n   - For \\( n = 9 \\): \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\)\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result**:\n   - Multiply \\( a_9 \\) by 3: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"
