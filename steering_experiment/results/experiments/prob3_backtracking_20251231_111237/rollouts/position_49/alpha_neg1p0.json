    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 0 * 3 = 0 + 2 = 2. 0 * 3 = 0. Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the initial multiplication, I thought 3*(1+3*(...)) would be 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers.\n\nLet me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula for such a recursive relation. Let's see. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI think this is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the pattern and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

I think I did it correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Sometimes, with these nested expressions, there's a pattern or formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recursive relation can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's find another condition. For n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Plugging into the general solution: 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the exponentiation, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get a_9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 4 * 3 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572? Let me check with a calculator method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used to compute this without going through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's confirm that. Wait, actually, let's see: The innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Then Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that 88,572 is the correct result. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^k. But in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3, it's a bit different. Wait, let me try to expand the entire expression to see if it forms a geometric series. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, and so on. Each time, we're adding another term which is 3 raised to the power corresponding to the layer. So, for Layer 1: 1 + 3^1 = 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9\nLayer 3: 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is equal to (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is indeed the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k divided by 2. But wait, our layers start from k=1, not k=0. Let me check:\n\nSum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nBut in our case, each layer is sum from k=1 to k=n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nSum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, sum from k=1 to k=n of 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 - 1 = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2\n\nBut in our formula earlier, we had a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, that suggests that the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we have. But in our layers, starting from Layer 1 as 1 + 3, which is sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = 4, correct. So, each layer n corresponds to sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, which is correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, it's equivalent to 3*(sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n3^11 = 177147\n\nTherefore, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, let me try computing it another way. Maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let's see, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, the first layer is 1 + 3 = 4, so a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, even derived a formula for the nth term, and it all lines up. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to find the value of the innermost expression, then work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 0\n\nThen, the next digit is 3 (from 29524, which is the ten-thousands place) \u00d7 3 = 9 \u2192 write down 9.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- Tens: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- Ten thousands: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct because 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 20000 = 60000\n\n3 \u00d7 9000 = 27000\n\n3 \u00d7 500 = 1500\n\n3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9 as 29524. Because each layer was built upon the previous one, so let me go back through each layer to check for any errors.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nThis confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, the sum can be expressed as a geometric progression.\n\nBut in this case, since each layer is only one term, not a sum, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nIn summary, by computing each nested layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrive at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

There's a 2 before the 9, so 2 * 3 = 6, but wait, no, the number is 29524, which is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 ones.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each adding another \"1 + 3(\" expression. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think my earlier calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. Let me compute a_1 through a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTo make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me check a couple of these computations again.\n\nFor a_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*a_9=3*29524.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I add 29524 * 3, I should get 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29000 * 3 = 87000, 524 * 3 = 1572, so 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount because I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see: Let's define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, computing a_9 as I did before, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Since it's a linear recurrence, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, let me check that. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me test that formula with the values I have. Here, k = 3, c = 1. So, a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1). Given that a_1 = 4, let's compute a_2: a_2 = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{1} - 1/2 = (4.5) * 3 - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{2} - 1/2 = 4.5 * 9 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40, which also matches. So the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_n = (4.5) * 3^{n-1} - 0.5. Simplifying, 4.5 is 9/2, so a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. 3^8 is 6561. So, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Compute 9/2 * 6561: 9 * 6561 = 59049, then divide by 2: 59049 / 2 = 29524.5. Then subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 is 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me think about that. The expression inside is 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) which can be represented as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. However, since each term is added to 1, it's not a straightforward geometric series, but perhaps I can express it in terms of a geometric series sum. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be seen as 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Wait, that might not help directly. Alternatively, since I already have a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, maybe it's more efficient to use that. So, using the formula, a_9 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, let me compute a few more layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's recompute from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but I just realized, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), and I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But wait, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Starting from the innermost, each parenthesis adds another 1+3. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, there's 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent Layer 2 to Layer 9. So that's 9 layers. But when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or pattern that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(previous). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that matches what I got earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n is defined in terms of the previous a_{n-1}. To find a closed-form solution, I can solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Similarly, for n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a closed-form formula gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9), which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n would be 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Suppose a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, a_n = A*3^{n} + B must equal 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Therefore, B = 1 + 3B, which implies that -2B = 1, so B = -1/2. Thus, a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, which gives A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9 for the innermost layer, but wait, actually, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is computed as (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, let me think carefully. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is a_9, which would be 1 + 3*a_8, and so on. So, the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524 =88572, which matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, we can compute it as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.

Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. When I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding up: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3*29524 again step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the number is 88572. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, let me check that: 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000, 476 \u00d7 3 = 1428. So 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I've got it right. The final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, without labeling the layers, to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've considered each step carefully and checked my work along the way, so I don't see any mistakes. This problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and working methodically from the inside out. It's easy to get lost in the layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated step by step, starting with the innermost expression and moving outward. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Now, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if that's the case. a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Yep, that's the same as before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute the result. Each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to the general solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So the final answer would be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check each step because I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct) So, I think that's right. Each step seems to follow correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which would save me from computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we're computing a_9, and then multiplying by 3. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the same result as before. Therefore, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient. But since I was able to compute each layer manually and verify that the formula gives the same result, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can solve it efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). This can be represented recursively.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the expression at the nth layer, starting from the innermost. The recursive formula is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The solution is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**: Since there are nine layers, we compute \\(a_9\\):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times \\(a_9\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Okay, that checks out. So the final result is 88572. But let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly. Sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make a small mistake that propagates through all the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nHmm, everything seems to add up. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So I think the final answer is 88572. Just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula gives the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. The expression inside each parenthesis is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which can be represented as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (a(r^{n} - 1))/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. However, in this case, the series isn't a straightforward geometric series because each term is added to 1 before being multiplied by 3. So, the recurrence approach seems more appropriate here. Another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is building up a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Maybe not necessary, since the step-by-step and recurrence methods both work. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit off. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each preceding one adds a layer. Let's count them: 1. (1+3) Layer 1\n2. (1+3(1+3)) Layer 2\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) Layer 3\n...\nContinuing up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So yes, I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers I computed:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term minus something? Let me see:\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 +1? 3*4=12 +1=13. Yes.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Similarly, 3*13=39 +1=40.\n\nWait, so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. To recap, I broke down the nested expression by computing each layer step by step, noticed a pattern which led me to a recurrence relation, solved it, and then computed the final result. It seems consistent across different methods, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives us a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Recognize the Recurrence Relation**: Each layer follows L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Solving this gives L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute Layer 9 Using the Formula**: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems to be the answer. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times the first layer, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so I think I did it correctly by computing up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3. Alternatively, maybe the first layer is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, so 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor Layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: n=5, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: n=6, a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: n=7, a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: n=8, a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yes, same result.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer step by step, and also derived a general formula that confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Using the closed-form solution \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), we compute the outermost layer (n=9) as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So Layer9 is 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer8 again. Layer8 is 1 +3*3280. 3280*3=9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841. 9841*3=29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29,524=88,572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer1=4, each subsequent layer is 1 +3*previous.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for a_n where a_1=4 and a_n=1+3*a_{n-1} can be derived.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 \u2192 C -3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A -1/2 \u2192 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check that multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems like I'm going one digit too far. Let me count the digits in 29524: it's 5 digits. So when I multiply by 3, it should be 5 digits. Wait, but when I did the multiplication, I ended up with more digits. Maybe I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me try again, writing each step properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n- Now, since there are no more digits, the carry over 2 would go to the next position, but since we're at the end, we just add it as a new digit. So, write down 2.\n\nWait, that gives us 88572. Let me check with a calculator to be sure. 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use that result in the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process, each time taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and using that in the next layer.\n4. After computing up to the 9th layer, which gives 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations, and each step follows logically from the previous one. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated until the outermost layer is reached.

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I have a feeling that this might not be the correct approach. Let me think again. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3( starts a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me parse it step by step: Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of times I have \"1+3(\":\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3).\n2. Then the next layer is (1+3(...)), where ... is the innermost.\n3. Each time we go out, we add another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So starting from the first 3, the next is 1+3(...), then another 1+3(...), etc. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"(\" after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first \"(\" after 3 is for the first inner layer.\n2. Then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each layer wraps around that, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 9 times? Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1+3). Then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9 because there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But I'm not sure if that's correct because when I first started, I thought the innermost is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another, so 9 layers in total. But when I computed Layer 9, I think that might actually be the outermost layer, so the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Suppose we have a general expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=1+3*4=13, n=3: a3=1+3*13=40, and so on, up to a9. Then the entire expression is 3*a9. So, if I compute a9, then multiply by 3, that should give me the answer. Let me compute a1 through a9 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a9 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you have nested expressions like this, the number of layers can be tricky to count. Let me count the number of layers again in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought earlier. Therefore, a9 is indeed 29524, and the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each step again:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I might have been overcomplicating it, but going through each step carefully helps prevent mistakes. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the ninth layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost as Layer 1, up to Layer 9. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let me write down the first few terms to see if there's a pattern. a1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Now, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2*C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3*A - 1/2\n\n3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, 3*a9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. By calculating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine the final value before multiplying by 3. The result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me write it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nFinal multiplication: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems to follow logically. Each layer is correctly calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, unless I made an arithmetic mistake in one of these steps, the final answer should be correct. Let me verify one or two of the layers again to be sure.\n\nChecking Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. 363 + 1 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. 1092 + 1 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the correct way to break it down because 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4. So:\n\n20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that my step-by-step computation is correct and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27+1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572, correct. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps? The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a solution of a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, right? Because the innermost is Layer 1, and then we go up to Layer 9. Wait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9 first using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Dividing by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, using the formula, I also get 88572, which confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. So, the answer is 88572. That was a bit of a brain teaser, but breaking it down layer by layer and then finding a general formula helped a lot. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward or by recognizing a pattern and using a formula. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer sequentially**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n4. **Alternative method using the formula**:\n   - Recognize the recurrence relation and derive the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n   - For Layer 9: \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be more than 80000. Wait, let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me write it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\nSo the digits, from right to left, are 2, 7, 5, 8, 7, 7. Wait, that would be 778572? Wait, no, that's not right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misaligning the digits. Let me try again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n- Ten-thousands place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\nSo writing it from the top, starting from the hundred-thousands place, we have 7, then 7, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. So the number is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's compute 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000. Then subtract (30000 - 29524) \u00d7 3. 30000 - 29524 = 476. So 476 \u00d7 3 = 1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I computed each layer correctly because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems to be the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just visualize the entire computation to make sure I didn't miss anything. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is a geometric progression kind of situation, but since it's finite, we can compute each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a recursive formula where each term is defined by the previous one. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, for n=2, f(2)=1 + 3*4=13, which matches. Then f(3)=1 + 3*13=40, and so on up to f(9)=29524. Then the total expression is 3*f(9)=88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value at each step and multiply the final result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost expression.\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Substitute Layer 1 into the next layer.\n   - 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Substitute Layer 2.\n   - 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Substitute Layer 3.\n   - 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. **Layer 5**: Substitute Layer 4.\n   - 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. **Layer 6**: Substitute Layer 5.\n   - 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. **Layer 7**: Substitute Layer 6.\n   - 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. **Layer 8**: Substitute Layer 7.\n   - 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. **Layer 9**: Substitute Layer 8.\n   - 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3.\n    - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me count the digits in 29524: it's 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nWait, that's only five digits, so after the ten-thousands place, there are no more digits, so the final number is 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\nThen multiply by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is correctly calculated, and the multiplication at the end is correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   - Final Answer: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, writing it out: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long calculation. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. For n=2, a_2 = 13 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B. Now, I can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plugging A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirmed the result I got by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, as before. So, using the formula for a geometric series, which is S = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), but in this case, it's a bit different because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. The formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, seems to fit. So, I think that's the most efficient way to compute it without having to manually calculate each layer. But since I only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, if there were more layers, the formula would definitely save time. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern defined by the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\). Using this, we compute each layer up to the ninth, which gives us 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each being \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, that seems off. Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.

Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Finally, the first digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions that I can use to verify. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a recursive formula where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another a_n. So, if I have n layers, the value would be a_n, and then the entire expression is 3*a_n. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see if we can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that matches what I had before. Now, let's try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a closed-form formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000=88048, +524=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent.

Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. But wait, there's no digit after 9, so the carry over 2 becomes 27. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8, no carry.\n- The next digit is 9 (the ten-thousands place in 29524), so 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, the digits are:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0\n- Hundreds:5*3=15 \u21925, carry1\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2\n- Ten-thousands:2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry0\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n- 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7.\n- 0 +5=5.\n- 9 +9=18, write 8, carry1.\n- 5 +2=7 +1=8.\n- 5 (from 59048) + nothing =5.\nWait, that seems off. Let me do it properly:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n8 +4=12 \u21922, carry1\n4 +2=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry0\n0 +5=5 \u21925, carry0\n9 +9=18 \u21928, carry1\n5 +2=7 +1=8 \u21928, carry0\n5 + nothing=5.\n\nSo the sum is 88572. So yes, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I get 88572. But let me check if I computed Layer 9 correctly. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the multiplication again because sometimes when I carry over, I might make a mistake.\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3 again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7. Write down7, carry over0.\n\n5*3=15. Write down5, carry over1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down8, carry over2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write down8, carry over0.\n\nNo more digits, so write down the carry if any, but here it's 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4.\n\nSo 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572. Perfect, that matches.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the innermost layer is found to be 4, and each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    - Multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier layers again because I feel like I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in calculation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and then the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 again. So, yes, my approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that this is a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, this seems to be a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another n. Since the original expression has nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model it as such. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or miscalculate. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that each layer is straightforward, and the numbers get big quickly, I think computing each layer step by step is the most reliable method here. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value at each step and substitute it into the next layer. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost value by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
