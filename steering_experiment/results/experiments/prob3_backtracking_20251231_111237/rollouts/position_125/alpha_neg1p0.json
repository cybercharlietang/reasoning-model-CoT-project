Alternatively, if I didn't think to use the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step is also feasible, albeit more time-consuming. Either way, the answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my arithmetic when multiplying 29524 by 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value of each layer step by step. The innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n4. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric progression. The solution using the recurrence is a solid way to confirm that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving the recurrence, we find that \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
