Wait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to think about it, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing step by step is feasible. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers again to see if I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 Yep, that's consistent.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3, so the total sum would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but with a finite number of terms. But since it's finite, the closed-form approach is better, as I did earlier. Alternatively, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, so it's 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 )? Wait, no, because in the closed-form, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's another way to compute it, which gives the same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step, using the recurrence relation, or applying the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.

Then each previous layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the total number of layers is 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, yes, layer 9 is the innermost, and we go up to layer 9, then multiply by 3. So, yes, that gives 29524 * 3 = 88572. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's another way to get the same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.

After computing layer 9, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. Verify the result using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. 5.

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each time it's wrapped in another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3\" parts. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3\" appears before the first closing parenthesis. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3(...), each time we have another 3(...). Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nHow many times does \"3(\" appear? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)), that's one.\n\nThen inside, another 3(1+3(...)), that's two.\n\nContinuing until the innermost is 1+3. So, how many 3( are there?

So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, in the given expression, how many layers are there?

But the innermost is just 1+3, not 1+3(. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and the innermost is just 1+3 without a (. So, total layers would be 9. That matches my initial counting. So, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9). So, that's why I computed up to Layer9 and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, perhaps I can compute a few layers using the formula to see if it matches my step-by-step computation.\n\nFor example, Layer1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: n=4, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer9 is indeed 29524, and the total expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or computations.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. So, each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but since it's nested, it's similar to the recurrence relation I solved earlier. Another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, starting from 4. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but with an added 1 each time. The formula I derived earlier should handle that. So, yeah, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me try computing a couple of the layers again. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, plus 3*1=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, everything checks out. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each layer is a geometric series. Let me see. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, expanding a few layers: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 Hmm, so each layer seems to be the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, up to 3^{n-1}. So, for a_n, it's the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that's the same as the closed-form solution I derived earlier. So, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, regardless of the method, whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing the geometric series, I arrive at the same result. I think that solidifies the answer as 88572.

Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(...), so perhaps it's better to consider how many layers are there. Wait, let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) segments. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(...), then each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought earlier. So, each layer corresponds to a_n where n=1 to n=9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let me see: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which is the same as before.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. For example, if there was only one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 Using the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, then 3*a_1 = 12. Correct. If there are two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39 Using the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, then 3*a_2 = 39. Correct. Similarly, three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(121) = 363 Using the formula: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, then 3*a_3 = 120. Wait, hold on, that doesn't match. Wait, no, wait, in the formula, a_n is the inner expression before multiplying by 3. Wait, no, in the formula, a_n is the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses. Wait, actually, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(...). So, in the formula, a_n corresponds to the inner expression, so the total expression is 3*a_n. So, for two layers, a_2 = 13, so 3*a_2 = 39, which matches. For three layers, a_3 = 40, so 3*a_3 = 120. Let me compute manually: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Yes, that's correct. So, the formula seems to hold.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, let me think about this another way. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to 3 + 9*(...). So, perhaps each layer can be represented as 3^{n} + something, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward. Alternatively, if I unroll the expression, each step adds a power of 3. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 1 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 1 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 = 3^4 + 1 Wait, is that true? Let me check: 3^1 = 3, Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 13 = 9 + 4, which is 3^2 + 4, but 4 is 3 + 1, so 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 13. Similarly, Layer 3: 40 = 27 + 13, which is 3^3 + 13, and 13 is 3^2 + 4, so 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 40. So, each layer adds the next power of 3. Therefore, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, that's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we found earlier. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

Let me just confirm once more by computing each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step until reaching the outermost layer. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can double-check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, for example, if we had only one layer: 3(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 Alternatively, using the formula: a_1 = 4, so 3*a_1 = 12, which is correct. If we have two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 Alternatively, using the formula: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, so 3*a_2 = 39, which is correct. Similarly, for three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 Wait, no, that's the same as two layers. Wait, no, three layers would be: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39, but according to the formula, a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, so 3*a_3 = 120. Wait, but when I compute it manually, I get 39. That's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me compute three layers manually. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Let's compute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4 Then next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Then outermost layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Wait, but earlier when I thought I was computing three layers, I must have miscounted. So, actually, three layers give 120, which matches the formula. So, perhaps when I thought I was computing three layers earlier, I was actually only computing two layers. So, that was a mistake on my part. Therefore, the formula seems to hold, and computing each layer step by step also gives the correct result. So, going back to the original problem, with nine layers, the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
