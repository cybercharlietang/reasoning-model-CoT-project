    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a bunch of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive kind of structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. The innermost part is 1+3, then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and so on. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. The innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). So the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost part). Wait, no, actually, let me check the structure again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the inside:\n\nLet me label each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, because I count nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count how many times 3 is being multiplied. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1), Layer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2), and this goes on until Layer 9, because the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(...), so maybe the innermost is Layer 1, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me make sure.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, because the outermost is multiplied by 3, which is Layer 9's result.\n\nWait, no. Let me see: The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So starting from Layer 1, which is 1+3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the final result is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo let me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let me do it properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 \u00d7 3:\n\n364 \u00d7 3: 4\u00d73=12, 6\u00d73=18, 3\u00d73=9 \u2192 12 + 180 + 900 = 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093 \u00d7 3:\n\n1000\u00d73=3000, 93\u00d73=279 \u2192 3000 + 279 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 \u00d7 3:\n\n3000\u00d73=9000, 280\u00d73=840 \u2192 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 \u00d7 3:\n\n9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3 \u2192 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nHmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me check again because the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 1\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)), so how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer, then each time it's wrapped in another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer is another (1 + 3*(...)). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts. From the innermost to the outermost, it's 8 layers because each time you have an additional (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, let me see: The innermost is (1+3). Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(1+3)). Then the next is (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))), and so on until the outermost. So how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 layer: (1+3)\n\nThen each additional layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so from the innermost to the outermost, it's 8 layers because each time you add another layer, the number of 3s increases by one.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, but perhaps I overcounted. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each time you go out, you add another layer. Let me count the number of times 3 is inside the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we apply the operation. Let me try to list the layers again, but this time correctly.\n\nLet me start from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the outermost 3 is applied to Layer 9, which is correct. So in total, there are 9 layers, but each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from Layer 1 as 4, up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) occurs. From the innermost to the outermost, it's 8 times, right? Because each time you have a (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to write the expression with indices.\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define E(n) as the expression with n layers. So:\n\nE(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE(2) = 1 + 3*E(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE(3) = 1 + 3*E(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE(4) = 1 + 3*E(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE(5) = 1 + 3*E(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE(6) = 1 + 3*E(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE(7) = 1 + 3*E(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE(8) = 1 + 3*E(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE(9) = 1 + 3*E(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute it in another way, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). This is a recurrence relation, and it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E(n).\n\nThe recurrence is E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E(n) = 3*E(n-1), whose solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form E_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E(n) = E_h(n) + E_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition E(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nE(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for E(9):\n\nE(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nThus, E(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, and both methods gave me the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3 to get the answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of this expression. It seems like there's a pattern here where each part is 3 times (1 plus something). Specifically, it looks like a nested expression where each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). So, maybe if I can compute the innermost part first and work my way out, I can solve this without getting lost in the parentheses.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, the last expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. \n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result of the previous step)). Let me note that. So, the next layer is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so now, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that:\n\n3*13 = 39\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, so each time, I'm taking the result from the innermost part, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. So, it's like each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to see how many layers there are here.\n\nLooking back at the original expression, I can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), so each time, the number of layers increases by one. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))))\n... and so on, until the innermost part.\n\nWait, let me count how many times 3 is multiplied by an expression. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). \n\nWait, perhaps it's better if I list each step with its corresponding result. Let me try that.\n\nLet's denote each layer as Layer 1, Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since I can see that the innermost is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, let's go step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(Layer 4) + 1 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) + 1 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(Layer 6) + 1 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) + 1 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8) + 1 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. Because in the original expression, after the initial 3, there are eight layers of (1 + 3(...)), right? Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each time, moving out, each (1 + 3(...)) is another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 3*(Layer 1) + 1 = 13 \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 3*(Layer 2) + 1 = 40 \u2192 Layer 3\n4. 3*(Layer 3) + 1 = 121 \u2192 Layer 4\n5. 3*(Layer 4) + 1 = 364 \u2192 Layer 5\n6. 3*(Layer 5) + 1 = 1093 \u2192 Layer 6\n7. 3*(Layer 6) + 1 = 3280 \u2192 Layer 7\n8. 3*(Layer 7) + 1 = 9841 \u2192 Layer 8\n9. 3*(Layer 8) + 1 = 29524 \u2192 Layer 9\n\nWait, but the original expression has 8 layers after the initial 3. Let me check again. The initial expression is 3 followed by 8 layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nWait, let's parse the original expression more carefully. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times (1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2192 Layer 3\n... and so on, until Layer 8, because after the initial 3, there are 8 such layers.\n\nWait, so perhaps the total number of layers is 8. So, let me recount with that in mind.\n\nSo, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(Layer 4) + 1 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) + 1 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(Layer 6) + 1 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) + 1 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n\nWait, so after 8 layers, the value is 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result, right? Because the initial expression is 3*(Layer 8). Wait, no. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 3*(...) + 1, except the innermost, which is just (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a (1 + ...). Each time, it's a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 3*(Layer 1) + 1 \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 3*(Layer 2) + 1 \u2192 Layer 3\n4. 3*(Layer 3) + 1 \u2192 Layer 4\n5. 3*(Layer 4) + 1 \u2192 Layer 5\n6. 3*(Layer 5) + 1 \u2192 Layer 6\n7. 3*(Layer 6) + 1 \u2192 Layer 7\n8. 3*(Layer 7) + 1 \u2192 Layer 8\n9. 3*(Layer 8) \u2192 Final result because the initial expression is 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, so perhaps the initial 3 is outside all these layers. So, the expression is 3 multiplied by the result of 8 layers of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841\n\nWait, so I think I was wrong before. The initial 3 is outside all these 8 layers, so after computing Layer 8 as 9841, the final result is 3*9841.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the 8-layer expression.\n\nSo, let me compute that:\n\n3 * 9841 = ?\n\nWell, 9841 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, 9841 * 3:\n\nLet's compute it step by step:\n\n3 * 1 = 3\n\n3 * 4 = 12, carry over 1.\n\n3 * 8 = 24, plus 1 carried over is 25. So, 5 and carry over 2.\n\n3 * 9 = 27, plus 2 carried over is 29. So, 9 and carry over 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we add the carry over 2 at the beginning.\n\nWait, that gives 29,523.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 8 as 9841, I think that might have been a mistake because I thought the initial expression had 8 layers, but perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me check again. So, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 3*(...) + 1 steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Layer 1\n\n2. 3*(4) + 1 = 13 \u2192 Layer 2\n\n3. 3*(13) + 1 = 40 \u2192 Layer 3\n\n4. 3*(40) + 1 = 121 \u2192 Layer 4\n\n5. 3*(121) + 1 = 364 \u2192 Layer 5\n\n6. 3*(364) + 1 = 1093 \u2192 Layer 6\n\n7. 3*(1093) + 1 = 3280 \u2192 Layer 7\n\n8. 3*(3280) + 1 = 9841 \u2192 Layer 8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if Layer 8 is indeed 9841.\n\nWait, Layer 7 was 3*(1093) + 1 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(3280) + 1 = 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nBut let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) +1.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each ( starts a new layer.\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer marked:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 8. So, that's 8 layers, each adding a new (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nTherefore, after computing 8 layers, the result is 9841, and then we multiply by the initial 3, giving 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the initial 3 is not part of the layers. So, the expression is 3*(result of 8 layers). So, that would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nWait, so:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_8.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_8.\n\nHmm, so if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me substitute a_n into the recurrence:\n\na_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n\n\nUsing the general solution:\n\nC*3^{n+1} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n+1} + 3D\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nC*3^{n+1} + D = 1 + C*3^{n+1} + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^{n+1} from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nNow, solve for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nAlternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 8, a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me check if this approach is correct. Because in the original expression, the initial 3 is multiplied by a_8, which is the result after 8 layers. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of the general formula.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_8 = 3*(3^{9} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 3)/2\n\nWait, because 3*a_8 = 3*(3^9 - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is 29,523.\n\nWait a second, but earlier I thought 3*9841 was 29,523, which matches with this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent.\n\n3^10 is indeed 59,049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2,187, 3^8 is 6,561, 3^9 is 19,683, and 3^10 is 59,049.\n\nYes, so 59,049 - 3 = 59,046, divided by 2 is 29,523.\n\nAlright, so I think I can confidently say that the result is 29,523.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*364 + 1 = 1,092 + 1 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 3*1,093 + 1 = 3,279 + 1 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 3*3,280 + 1 = 9,840 + 1 = 9,841\n\nThen, 3*9,841 = 29,523\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 29,523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost part outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 4 + 1 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 13 + 1 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 40 + 1 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 121 + 1 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 364 + 1 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 1093 + 1 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 3280 + 1 = 9841\\)\n\nAfter computing the 8th layer, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{29523}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning each part inside the parentheses is another similar expression. So, starting from the innermost part and working my way out might be the best approach. Let me try to visualize this. The innermost part is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. It seems like a pattern that repeats itself multiple times. \n\nLet me write down the expression step by step to see if I can spot a pattern or a way to simplify it. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. So, starting with the innermost parentheses: \n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nSo, the next layer out would be 3 times that result. Let me compute that:\n\n2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12. \n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3 * something). Wait, let me make sure. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). \n\nWait, maybe I should approach this methodically. Let me define each layer step by step. Let me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost. So, layer 1 is the innermost, layer 2 is the next one out, and so on up to layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nBut actually, let's count how many layers there are. Let me see: starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see there are 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 9, and moving outwards.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work our way out. Let me try that. So, starting with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, it's 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, the next layer out is (1 + 12) = 13.\n\nThen, moving out another layer, it's 3*(13) = 39.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. Actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, no, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + result of the inner layer). Hmm, perhaps I should define each step as follows:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, S3, etc., where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 3*(S1) = 3*4 = 12. Let's call this S2.\n\nThen, the next layer out is 1 + S2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this S3.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the structure is:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + the result of the inner layer). So, maybe S1 is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, S2 is 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, that seems different from before. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the structure alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the entire expression with placeholders to see the structure better. Let me denote each nested part:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(A), where A is (1 + 3*(B)), where B is (1 + 3*(C)), and so on, until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, the next layer out is (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but that seems to be adding 1 and then multiplying by 3 each time. Wait, no, actually, each time we have 3*(1 + previous result). Let me try to model this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each step as follows:\n\nLet me define each step as starting from the innermost and working outward. So, each step is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, but in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward, each time computing 3*(1 + result of the inner layer).\n\nWait, maybe an example will help.\n\nLet me consider a smaller version of the problem to see the pattern. Let's say we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). That's a simpler version with only two layers. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nSo, the entire expression would be 15.\n\nWait, so in this case, with two layers, the result is 15.\n\nSimilarly, if we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), that's three layers. Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nSo, the result is 48.\n\nWait, so each time we add another layer, we're effectively doing 3*(1 + previous result). So, each step is 3*(1 + previous step's result). So, perhaps we can model this as a sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term).\n\nLet me try to model this for the given problem, which has nine layers. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 4, as we saw.\n\nLet me try to list each step:\n\nLet me denote S_n as the result after n layers.\n\nSo, S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nS_2 = 3*(1 + S_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nS_3 = 3*(1 + S_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nS_4 = 3*(1 + S_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nS_5 = 3*(1 + S_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nS_6 = 3*(1 + S_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nS_7 = 3*(1 + S_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nS_8 = 3*(1 + S_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nS_9 = 3*(1 + S_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that. Because in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so after S_9, which is the result of the innermost layer, each subsequent S_n is 3*(1 + previous S). So, perhaps S_9 is the result of the innermost (1 + 3), and then each S_n is 3*(1 + S_{n-1}).\n\nWait, but in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, perhaps S_1 is (1 + 3) = 4, and then each subsequent S_n is 3*(1 + S_{n-1}), for n from 2 to 9.\n\nWait, so if I compute up to S_9, that would be the result of the innermost expression, but then the outermost expression is 3*(1 + S_9). Wait, no, actually, let me think again.\n\nWait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, each step is 3*(1 + S_{n-1}).\n\nWait, so S_1 = (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, S_2 = 3*(1 + S_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nS_3 = 3*(1 + S_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nS_4 = 3*(1 + S_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nS_5 = 3*(1 + S_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nS_6 = 3*(1 + S_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nS_7 = 3*(1 + S_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nS_8 = 3*(1 + S_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nS_9 = 3*(1 + S_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + S_9). Wait, no, that can't be, because S_9 is already 3*(1 + S_8), so the outermost layer would be 3*(1 + S_9). Wait, but that would be S_10. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each layer as a step where I compute 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, which is the first step, then each subsequent step is 3*(1 + previous result). So, if there are nine layers, then I need to compute nine steps of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times do I apply 3*(1 + ...)?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3*(1 + ...) operations. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time I have 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of 3*(1 + ...) operations is equal to the number of layers minus one. Because the innermost is just (1 + 3), and each layer after that is 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, so if there are nine layers of parentheses, that means the innermost is (1 + 3), and then there are eight layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I need to compute eight steps of 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's take a smaller example. Suppose we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). That's three layers: the outermost 3*(...), then inside is (1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many 3*(1 + ...) operations are there? Two: first, compute (1 + 3) = 4, then compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then compute 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Wait, but in this case, the outermost is 3*(1 + 15), so that's two steps of 3*(1 + ...). Hmm, but in the problem, we have nine layers, so perhaps eight steps of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me see the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) instances. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 introduces a new 3*(1 + ...). So, from the expression, I can see that after the first 3, there are nine opening parentheses, but each of those is part of a 3*(1 + ...) structure. Wait, perhaps it's better to count how many times 3 is used as a multiplier. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and each layer inside adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the number of 3*(1 + ...) operations is equal to the number of layers minus one. Since the innermost is just (1 + 3), and each layer above that is 3*(1 + ...). So, if there are nine layers, that would mean eight 3*(1 + ...) operations.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example with two layers, I had 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which had two layers: the outer 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) and the inner (1 + 3). So, in that case, the number of 3*(1 + ...) operations is two: first, 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then 3*(1 + 12) = 48. Wait, but that's two operations, and there are two layers beyond the innermost. Hmm, perhaps the number of operations is equal to the number of layers beyond the innermost.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and keep track of each result.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but now I'm at Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, right? Because each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the final result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, after nine layers, starting from (1 + 3) = 4, we have:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original problem has nine layers of parentheses, so I think this approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term. Let me see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at the results:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 15\n\nLayer 3: 48\n\nLayer 4: 147\n\nLayer 5: 444\n\nLayer 6: 1335\n\nLayer 7: 4008\n\nLayer 8: 12027\n\nLayer 9: 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, let me see:\n\nFrom 4 to 15: 4*3 + 3 = 15\n\nFrom 15 to 48: 15*3 + 3 = 48\n\nFrom 48 to 147: 48*3 + 3 = 147\n\nFrom 147 to 444: 147*3 + 3 = 444\n\nYes, so each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. So, the recurrence relation is S_n = 3*S_{n-1} + 3, with S_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, that's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is S_n = 3*S_{n-1} + 3, with S_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is S_n - 3*S_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is S_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution S_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition S_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1: 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is S_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: S_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as S_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1: S_1 should be 4.\n\nS_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: S_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, S_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, S_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 11*19683: Let's compute 10*19683 = 196830, plus 19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513.\n\nThen, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504.\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216,504 / 6.\n\nLet me compute that: 6*36,000 = 216,000. So, 216,504 - 216,000 = 504. 504 /6 = 84. So, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084.\n\nSo, S_9 = 36,084.\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\n3^9 is indeed 19,683. 11 times that is 11*19,683.\n\nLet me compute 10*19,683 = 196,830.\n\nPlus 19,683 = 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513.\n\nSubtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504.\n\nDivide by 6: 216,504 \u00f7 6.\n\n6*36,000 = 216,000.\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504.\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84.\n\nSo, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the result is 36,084.\n\nSo, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer step by step, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\\).\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). Since there are multiple layers, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part: \n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). \n2. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + that result). \n3. Then another layer around that, and so on. \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time, after the first, it's a 3*(1 + ... So, starting from the innermost, I think there are 9 layers. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each time wrapping it with 3*(1 + ... So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3(1+... parts.\n\n1. Innermost: 3(1+3)\n2. Next: 3(1 + [previous])\n3. Then another 3(1 + ...)\n4. Continuing this way, I think there are 9 layers in total. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working out. So, let's define each step as a layer.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) eight times? Or is it nine times? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let's see how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, that's nine layers. Therefore, the final result is 36084. But let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Let me check 1336*3: 1336*3 is 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Let's compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so total 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so total 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems to be correct. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from 4, then 15, 48, etc., up to 36084. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, is there a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without manually computing each layer? Maybe a geometric series or something?\n\nLet me think. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 3*(1 + term_previous). Let me define a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value at layer n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n... and so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), which can be rewritten as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*(3^n). Alternatively, 11/6 is 1 and 5/6, so it's 11*3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWe can factor out 3^{n}:\n\n= (11/6)*3^n - (3/2)\n\n= (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2\n\n= (11*3^{n} - 9)/6.\n\nYes, because 3/2 is 9/6, so:\n\n= (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4: (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 10*19683 = 196830\n\nThen, add 19683: 196830 + 19683 = 216,513.\n\nSo, 11*19683 = 216,513.\n\nSubtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504.\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216,504 / 6.\n\nDivide step by step:\n\n216,504 \u00f7 6:\n\n6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3.\n\n6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0.\n\n6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5.\n\n6 into 50 is 8, remainder 2.\n\n6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0.\n\nSo, 216,504 \u00f7 6 = 36,084.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = 36,084. Which matches our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 15\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 48\\)\n4.

Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 12027\\)\n9. Final layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 36084\\)\n\nUsing a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the result is \\(36084\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}."

So, it's like a chain of 3s and 1s. Maybe the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Let me count how many layers there are here. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then that's inside another 1+3, and so on. Let me see: starting from the inside, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, the expression is 3(1+3(...)), and each time, there's another 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

So, actually, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps it with 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times I see 1+3(...).

Let me count how many times 3 is multiplied: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, if I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's 8. So, that means there are 8 layers? Wait, no, let's see: each time, a new 1+3 is added inside another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer.

So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see 1+3: the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me count: starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, so the number of 1+3 expressions is 9? Wait, no, because each time, it's 1+3*(...). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because each 1+3 is inside another 3*(1+3*(...)), and there are 9 such layers.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as starting from the innermost and working outward, each time calculating the value step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because that seems a bit high, and maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers I have here.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I have 9 layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time, there's a 1+3, and each is wrapped by another 3*(1+3*(...)). So, how many times does this wrapping happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), and each time, there's another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is the number of times I can see 1+3 inside. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, wrapping it:\n\n2. 3*(1+3)\n\nThen, wrapping that:\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until we have 9 layers. Wait, no, because each time we add a new 1+3 inside, so perhaps the number of layers is 9, which would correspond to 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me check: the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ So, starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is at the end, and then each preceding 1+3 is wrapped by another 3*(1+3*(...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n\n2. The next one out is 1+3*(1+3).\n\n3. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)).\n\nContinuing this way, each time adding another layer. So, the number of layers is 9, as each 1+3 is inside another 3*(1+3*(...)), up to 9 times. So, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by counting the number of 1+3 expressions. The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3, so the total number of 1+3 terms is 9. Therefore, I have 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then finally, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does the pattern (1+3(...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's a new opening parenthesis, so let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is one opening parenthesis.\n\n- Then, inside that, another (1+3(...)), so that's two.\n\nContinuing this way, how many opening parentheses are there after the first 3? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the number of opening parentheses is 9. Therefore, there are 9 layers, meaning I need to compute up to Layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but let me check whether the number of layers is indeed 9. Alternatively, perhaps it's 8 layers, because the innermost is 1+3, and then each wrapping adds a layer. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n\n2. 1+3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n\n3. 1+3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n\n4. 1+3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n\n5. 1+3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n\n6. 1+3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n\n7. 1+3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n\n8. 1+3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n\n9. 1+3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time wrapping the previous result with 1+3*(...). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, how many times does the pattern 1+3(...) occur? Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time, it's 1+3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many times do we have 1+3? Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost: 1+3\n\n2. Then, 1+3*(1+3)\n\n3. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\nContinuing this, each time, we add another 1+3 inside. So, the number of 1+3 terms is 9, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, my calculation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check: when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's 9. So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the first layer after the initial 3 is one opening parenthesis, then another, up to 9. So, that would mean 9 layers, each time wrapping the previous result. Therefore, my calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me test this with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Suppose I have a simpler expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). How would that compute?\n\nLet's compute this step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1+3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4 = 1+12=13\n\nNext layer: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nThen, 3*(4)=12\n\nThen, 1+12=13\n\nThen, 3*(13)=39\n\nThen, 1+39=40\n\nThen, 3*40=120\n\nYes, that works. So, in this case, with 3 layers, the result is 120. So, using the same method, if I have 9 layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that smaller example again to make sure my approach is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's see: solving the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 manually.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27, but wait, 29524 is:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nCompute:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nThen, 0*3=0 +2=2.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning each part is inside another set of parentheses. So, to solve it, I should probably start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me count how many times the '1+3' appears. Hmm, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me see: each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so I think there are nine layers here because each opening parenthesis adds another layer, and I can count nine sets of parentheses starting from the innermost. Wait, actually, looking again, maybe it's eight layers? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, each time you go out a layer, you add another 1+3. So if I count the number of times 1+3 is written, it's nine times. But maybe the number of multiplications by 3 is eight? Hmm, perhaps. Let me try to parse it.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3. Then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(something). Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost. So:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). So the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's see, 29524*3. 24*3=72, carryover 7. 24 becomes 24, so 24*3=72, write down 2, carryover 7. Next digit: 5*3=15 plus 7 is 22, write down 2, carryover 2. Next digit: 9*3=27 plus 2 is 29, write down 9, carryover 2. Next digit: 5*3=15 plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 plus 1 is 7, write down 7. So putting it all together: 7, 7, 9, 2, 2, 2? Wait, maybe I did that wrong. Let me compute 29524*3 properly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n- 9*3=27, but wait, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 29524*3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524*3: 29,524 *3. 29,524 * 3: 29,000*3=87,000; 524*3=1,572. So 87,000 +1,572=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did each layer correctly because that's a lot of steps.\n\nStarting with L1: 1+3=4.\n\nL2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me just verify each step again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nL1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each layer is 1 + 3*previous. If I let L1=4, then L2=1+3*4=13, L3=1+3*13=40, etc. So each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's say L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nSo L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply initial condition L1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 3A -1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo the solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for each layer n, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: L1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, L9=29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: is there another way to approach this without computing each layer? Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, maybe we can express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is 3*(L9). And L9 is the ninth layer, which we found to be 29524.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is defined as L_n=1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we have L9, then the total is 3*L9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me think: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. So each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start from the innermost part of the expression because that's usually how you handle parentheses. So, the innermost part is 1+3. Let me write that down: 1 + 3. That's easy, that equals 4. So, now I can replace that innermost part with 4. \n\nSo, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3(1+3). Wait, no, let me check. Actually, the next part after the innermost is 1+3(1+3). Wait, no, hold on. Let me parse this correctly. \n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So, starting from the inside, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, the next one is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to structure this.\n\nLet me count how many times this happens. Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, it's 9 opening parentheses, each with a corresponding closing parenthesis. So, that means there are 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then each time, we do 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's do that step by step.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3 * 9000 = 27000\n\nThen, 3 * 500 = 1500\n\nThen, 3 * 24 = 72\n\nNow, adding all those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is actually 88572. Let me verify with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n2. 1+3*4=13\n3. 1+3*13=40\n4. 1+3*40=121\n5. 1+3*121=364\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, which gives 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized, the original expression is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the 9 layers. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed as a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term.\n\nLet me see if I can find a closed-form formula for this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the closed-form. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4, which is correct. For n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, correct. So, yes, the formula seems accurate.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Start from the innermost: 1+3=4\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result)\n3. After 9 layers, the result is 29524\n4. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88572\n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). After 9 layers, the innermost expression equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards might be the best approach here. That usually works with nested parentheses. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). Let me count how many layers there are here. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count: 1+3, then another layer around that, and so on. Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there exactly? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...), so each time it's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), that's one layer.\n- Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that's the second layer.\n- Each time I move out, it's another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(...)\" before the final closing parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n1. The very last part is (1 + 3), that's the innermost, so that's one.\n2. Then, moving out, each time I see another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of 3's before each 1. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, I can just start computing from the inside and work my way out. Since each step depends on the previous one, this might be manageable.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, E_1 is the innermost, E_2 is the next layer out, and so on, up to E_9, which would be the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me check how many layers there are. Let's look at the original expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the innermost, so that's E_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + E_1). So E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1).\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + E_2) = E_3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me start with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + result from innermost). So:\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, moving out another layer, we have 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something because each time I'm moving out, I'm adding a new layer, but let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)). Let me look at the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), and inside that, there's another 3*(1 + ...), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...))\n- Then, inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- This continues until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside the first (1 + 3*(...)), so that's one.\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that's two.\n3. Continuing this way, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...), so how many times does this occur?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Each time, it's 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each time, a new layer is added. Let's count the number of times this occurs.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one layer.\n- Inside that, another 3*(1 + 3(...)), so that's two layers.\n- Continuing until the innermost, which is just (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, (1 + 3) is the first layer, then each time we add a layer by wrapping another 3*(1 + ...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers?\n\nLet me try to visualize the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which gives 36084. So, is that the answer? Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step is multiplying 3 by one more than the previous layer's result. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 15, then 48, etc., up to 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic for each step to be thorough.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336 * 3:\n\n1336 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So, 3000 + 900 = 3900, +90 = 3990, +18 = 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009 * 3:\n\n4000*3 = 12000, 9*3=27, so 12000 + 27 = 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028 * 3:\n\n12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so 36000 + 84 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct, so the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(...)) \u2013 that's the first 3.\n\nThen inside, another 3(1+3(...)) \u2013 that's the second 3.\n\nContinuing until the innermost 3(1+3). So, how many 3(1+3(...) are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which has an opening parenthesis.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), so that's another opening parenthesis.\n\nThis continues until the innermost (1 + 3), which doesn't have any further nesting.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time we have an opening parenthesis, so:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then, inside, another 3(1 + 3(...\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nLet me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let me count the number of times I see \"3(\":\n\n- 3(1+3(\n- Then, inside, 3(1+3(\n- And so on.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3\n\nWait, so that's 9 instances of 3(, but the last one is just 3(1+3 without any further nesting. So, that's 9 layers, which matches the 9 layers I computed earlier. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each corresponding to each 3(.\n\nSo, that means my calculation up to Layer 9 is correct, giving 36084.\n\nWait, just to make sure, perhaps I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere.\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nThe expression is of the form:\n\nE = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...)))\n\nThis is a finite nested expression with n layers, where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nLet me denote the value after k layers as E_k. Then, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nAnd so on, up to E_9.\n\nI can see that each E_k = 3*(1 + E_{k-1}).\n\nThis is a recursive formula, where each term depends on the previous one.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form formula for E_n, but given that it's only 9 layers, computing step by step is manageable, but perhaps for better understanding, I can explore the pattern.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern.\n\nE_1 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nE_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nE_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nE_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nE_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nE_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084.\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times (1 plus the previous term). So, each term is 3*(1 + E_{k-1}).\n\nAlternatively, we can write E_k = 3 + 3*E_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nWe have E_k = 3*(1 + E_{k-1}) = 3 + 3*E_{k-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence is E_k = 3*E_{k-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving E_k = 3*E_{k-1}, which has the solution E_k^{(h)} = C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution E_k^{(p)} = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 3*D + 3.\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 3 => -2D = 3 => D = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_k = C*3^k - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nWhen k=1, E_1 = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3C - 3/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2.\n\nThus, C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_k = (11/6)*3^k - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\nE_k = (11/6)*3^k - 3/2 = (11*3^{k-1} ) - 3/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n(11/6)*3^k = 11*(3^k)/6 = 11*(3^{k})/6.\n\nAlternatively, 11/6 is the coefficient.\n\nWait, let's compute E_1 using this formula to check:\n\nE_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - (3/2) = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nE_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - (9/6) = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nE_3 = (11/6)*3^3 - 3/2 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - (9/6) = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nE_4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - (9/6) = 882/6 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, E_k = (11/6)*3^k - 3/2.\n\nBut since we have 9 layers, k=9.\n\nSo, E_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, E_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nCompute 3280 * 11 = 36080\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo, total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nSo, E_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nI think that's thorough. I checked each step, ensured that the arithmetic was correct, and even derived a closed-form formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that 36084 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer**:  \n   $1 + 3 = 4$\n\n2. **Next layer**:  \n   $3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15$\n\n3. **Next layer**:  \n   $3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48$\n\n4. **Next layer**:  \n   $3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147$\n\n5. **Next layer**:  \n   $3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444$\n\n6. **Next layer**:  \n   $3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335$\n\n7. **Next layer**:  \n   $3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008$\n\n8. **Next layer**:  \n   $3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027$\n\n9. **Outermost layer**:  \n   $3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084$\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like there's a pattern here. Let me try to count how many times the 3 is being multiplied. Let me see... Each opening parenthesis has a 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, then 1+3 times that, and so on. Hmm, maybe I can work from the inside out. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me start by writing down the innermost part first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13.\n\nAlright, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if this continues.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(40). That would be 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. So, 121 is the result here. Moving on, the next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, so that's 364.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is 1 + 3*(364). Let's see: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Calculating that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Hmm, 3280.\n\nMoving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(3280). So, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Okay, that's 9841. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that: 3*9841 is... Let me see, 9841 * 3. Well, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 29523 plus 1 is 29524. So, that layer is 29524.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. 9841 * 3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Yep, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Well, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 88572 plus 1 is 88573.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. So, 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nAlright, so the next layer is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 88573 * 3: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 265719 plus 1 is 265720.\n\nLet me verify that: 88573 * 3. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 + 24000 = 264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. So, 265719 +1=265720. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute that. 265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160. So, 797160 plus 1 is 797161.\n\nWait, let me make sure: 265720 * 3. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000=780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160. Yep, so 797160 +1=797161.\n\nAlright, so the next layer is 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute that. 797161 *3: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 2100000 +270000=2370000, +21000=2391000, +300=2391300, +180=2391480, +3=2391483. So, 2391483 +1=2391484.\n\nLet me check that: 797161 *3. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, 2100000 +270000=2370000, +21000=2391000, +300=2391300, +180=2391480, +3=2391483. So, 2391483 +1=2391484. Correct.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(2391484). Let me compute that. 2391484 *3: Let's break it down. 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 6000000 +900000=6900000, +270000=7170000, +3000=7173000, +1200=7174200, +240=7174440, +12=7174452. So, 7174452 +1=7174453.\n\nWait, let me make sure: 2391484 *3. 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. So, 6000000 +900000=6900000, +270000=7170000, +3000=7173000, +1200=7174200, +240=7174440, +12=7174452. So, 7174452 +1=7174453. Correct.\n\nAlright, so now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(7174453). Let me compute that. 7174453 *3: Let's break it down. 7000000*3=21000000, 100000*3=300000, 70000*3=210000, 4000*3=12000, 400*3=1200, 50*3=150, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 21000000 +300000=21300000, +210000=21510000, +12000=21522000, +1200=21523200, +150=21523350, +9=21523359. So, 21523359 +1=21523360.\n\nLet me verify: 7174453 *3. 7000000*3=21000000, 100000*3=300000, 70000*3=210000, 4000*3=12000, 400*3=1200, 50*3=150, 3*3=9. So, 21000000 +300000=21300000, +210000=21510000, +12000=21522000, +1200=21523200, +150=21523350, +9=21523359. So, 21523359 +1=21523360. Correct.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3*(21523360). Let me compute that. 21523360 *3: Let's break it down. 20000000*3=60000000, 1000000*3=3000000, 500000*3=1500000, 20000*3=60000, 3000*3=9000, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 0*3=0. Adding those together: 60000000 +3000000=63000000, +1500000=64500000, +60000=64560000, +9000=64569000, +900=64569900, +180=64570080, +0=64570080. So, 64570080 +1=64570081.\n\nWait, let me make sure: 21523360 *3. 20000000*3=60000000, 1000000*3=3000000, 500000*3=1500000, 20000*3=60000, 3000*3=9000, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 0*3=0. So, 60000000 +3000000=63000000, +1500000=64500000, +60000=64560000, +9000=64569000, +900=64569900, +180=64570080, +0=64570080. So, 64570080 +1=64570081. Correct.\n\nAlright, so that's the result inside the outermost parentheses. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the entire expression is 3*(64570081). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 64570081: Let's break it down. 60000000*3=180000000, 4000000*3=12000000, 500000*3=1500000, 70000*3=210000, 0*3=0, 0*3=0, 80*3=240, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 180000000 +12000000=192000000, +1500000=193500000, +210000=193710000, +0=193710000, +0=193710000, +240=193710240, +3=193710243.\n\nWait, let me verify that: 3 * 64570081. 60,000,000*3=180,000,000, 4,000,000*3=12,000,000, 500,000*3=1,500,000, 70,000*3=210,000, 0*3=0, 0*3=0, 80*3=240, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 180,000,000 +12,000,000=192,000,000, +1,500,000=193,500,000, +210,000=193,710,000, +0=193,710,000, +0=193,710,000, +240=193,710,240, +3=193,710,243.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 64,570,081 *3 should be around 193,710,243. Let me check with another method. Maybe I can compute 64,570,081 *3 directly:\n\n64,570,081\n*         3\n------------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n1*3=3\n8*3=24, write down 4, carry over 2\n0*3=0 +2=2\n0*3=0\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1\n4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carry over 1\n6*3=18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1\nFinally, 6*3=18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1, but since there's no more digits, write down 1.\n\nWait, that might not be the right way. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     64,570,081\n   x          3\n   -------------\n     193,710,243\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 64,570,081 *3=193,710,243.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 193,710,243.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the previous steps because that's a big number. Let me go back and check each step.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13. Then 1+3*13=40. Then 1+3*40=121. Then 1+3*121=364. Then 1+3*364=1093. Then 1+3*1093=3280. Then 1+3*3280=9841. Then 1+3*9841=29524. Then 1+3*29524=88573. Then 1+3*88573=265720. Then 1+3*265720=797161. Then 1+3*797161=2391484. Then 1+3*2391484=7174453. Then 1+3*7174453=21523360. Then 1+3*21523360=64570081. Then 3*64570081=193,710,243.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and each multiplication and addition was checked. So, the final result is 193,710,243.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can count the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of (1+3(...)): starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let me see:\n\nStarting with the innermost: 1+3.\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times '1+3' appears inside.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nEach time it's 1+3(...), so the number of times is 9. Because from the innermost, we have 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), etc., up to 9 layers. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I went through 9 layers, each time computing the next layer out, so that would mean 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from 4.\n\nWait, but when I started, the innermost was 1+3=4, then each layer out added one more multiplication and addition, so in total, how many layers did I compute? Let me recount:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n\n2. 1+3*4=13\n\n3. 1+3*13=40\n\n4. 1+3*40=121\n\n5. 1+3*121=364\n\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n\n10. 1+3*29524=88573\n\n11. 1+3*88573=265720\n\n12. 1+3*265720=797161\n\n13. 1+3*797161=2391484\n\n14. 1+3*2391484=7174453\n\n15. 1+3*7174453=21523360\n\n16. 1+3*21523360=64570081\n\n17. 3*64570081=193,710,243\n\nWait, so that's 17 steps, but actually, each step after the first one is a layer. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is step 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen step 2: 1+3*4=13.\n\nStep 3: 1+3*13=40.\n\nStep 4: 1+3*40=121.\n\nStep 5: 1+3*121=364.\n\nStep 6: 1+3*364=1093.\n\nStep 7: 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nStep 8: 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nStep 9: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nStep 10: 1+3*29524=88573.\n\nStep 11: 1+3*88573=265720.\n\nStep 12: 1+3*265720=797161.\n\nStep 13: 1+3*797161=2391484.\n\nStep 14: 1+3*2391484=7174453.\n\nStep 15: 1+3*7174453=21523360.\n\nStep 16: 1+3*21523360=64570081.\n\nStep 17: 3*64570081=193,710,243.\n\nSo, that's 17 steps, but the original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that each time I computed a layer, I got the next number, and in the end, I multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, it's a nested multiplication. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But in this case, the nesting is finite, with 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, maybe it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3. f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1). f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2), and so on. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nSo, f(1)=4\n\nf(2)=1+3*4=13\n\nf(3)=1+3*13=40\n\nf(4)=1+3*40=121\n\nf(5)=1+3*121=364\n\nf(6)=1+3*364=1093\n\nf(7)=1+3*1093=3280\n\nf(8)=1+3*3280=9841\n\nf(9)=1+3*9841=29524\n\nf(10)=1+3*29524=88573\n\nf(11)=1+3*88573=265720\n\nf(12)=1+3*265720=797161\n\nf(13)=1+3*797161=2391484\n\nf(14)=1+3*2391484=7174453\n\nf(15)=1+3*7174453=21523360\n\nf(16)=1+3*21523360=64570081\n\nf(17)=1+3*64570081=193,710,244\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, the final result was 193,710,243, which is one less than this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the last step.\n\nWait, in my initial computation, after f(16)=64570081, then the entire expression is 3*f(16)=3*64570081=193,710,243. But in the recursive function above, f(17)=1+3*f(16)=1+3*64570081=1+193,710,243=193,710,244.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(f(9)), because the innermost is f(1)=4, then f(2)=13, up to f(9)=29524, then the expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572, but wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the number of layers. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's f(1)=4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers of 1+3(...).\n\nSo, f(1)=4\n\nf(2)=1+3*4=13\n\nf(3)=1+3*13=40\n\nf(4)=1+3*40=121\n\nf(5)=1+3*121=364\n\nf(6)=1+3*364=1093\n\nf(7)=1+3*1093=3280\n\nf(8)=1+3*3280=9841\n\nf(9)=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with my earlier computation where I went up to f(16)=64570081, and then multiplied by 3 to get 193,710,243.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me look at the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1+3*(previous). Let's count:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen, each time moving out, it's layer 2 up to layer 9.\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, f(9)=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier computation where I went up to f(16)=64570081 and then multiplied by 3 to get 193,710,243.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses before the closing ones. Wait, let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I notice that this expression is built up with multiple layers of parentheses, each containing a 1 and a 3 multiplied together. It seems like each layer is of the form $3(1 + something)$. So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That makes sense because parentheses dictate the order of operations, so innermost should be done first.\n\nLet me try to write down each layer step by step. Let's see, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost part is $1+3$. That's simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\n2. Next layer out is $1 + 3(1+3)$. Wait, no, actually, looking back, each layer is $1 + 3*(previous result)$. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the structure is $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))$. So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next inner expression). So starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then moving outwards.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to represent each layer as a step. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say:\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E_n, where n is the number of layers. So starting from the innermost, which is E_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving outwards, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1.\n\nSimilarly, E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2, and so on, until E_9, since there are 9 layers of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So how many layers? Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\":\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, in the original problem, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So the number of layers is 9, because each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and there are 9 such layers. Let me check:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So the number of layers is 9.\n\nTherefore, we can model this as a recursive sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me define E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(E_9), because the outermost layer is 3*(E_9).\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting with E_1:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So E_6=1+1092=1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So E_7=1+3279=3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So E_8=1+9840=9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So E_9=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9=3*29524.\n\nNow, compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo:\n\n20000*3=60,000\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count extra.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. E_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. E_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. E_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. E_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. E_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. E_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*E_9 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and I don't see any miscalculations in the multiplications or additions. So I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(3(1 + \\text{previous layer})\\).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of this expression. It seems like a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus something). So, it's like a chain of operations where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward, simplifying each part as I go. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 is 12. Then, we add 1 to that. So, 1 + 12 is 13. \n\nWait, no, actually, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not getting confused here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, yes, that would be 1 + 3*4, which is 1 + 12 = 13. \n\nLet me write this step by step to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7.

Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(88573) = 265,719\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me double-check these calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each step again more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. First innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3.

Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Compute 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000+27000=87000 +1500=88500 +72=88572. Then, 1 + 88572=88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n11. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*88573. Compute 88573*3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 +24000=264000 +1500=265500 +210=265710 +9=265719 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so after double-checking each step, it seems that my calculations are correct. So, the final result is 265,719.\n\nBut wait a second, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern, so I can verify my answer without having to compute each step manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nLooking at the structure of the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. This reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say:\n\nLet a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )), starting from the innermost, which is 9 layers deep.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of times we have (1+3(...)): \n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) \u2013 that's the first layer.\n\nBut actually, each layer is one more (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many times the operation is applied. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) terms.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). Inside that, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), and so on. So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) +1? Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, so how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 starts a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(...))\n2. Inside that: (1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms:\n\nFrom the expression, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, let's see:\n\n- The first (1+3(...)) is layer 1.\n\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...)) is layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen each step outward adds another layer. So, let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach time, there's a new (1+3(...)). So, starting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. First (1+3(...)): layer 1\n\n2. Next (1+3(...)): layer 2\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3): layer 9.\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers. So, from the innermost, layer 1 is (1+3)=4, up to layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(layer8). Then, the outermost 3*(layer9) is the final step.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 11 steps, but that was because I included the final multiplication by 3 as step 11. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, and then the final multiplication is the 10th step.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3)=4.\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524)=88572, but wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, the outermost would be 3*(1 + 3*(layer9)).\n\nWait, no, the outermost is 3*(layer9). Because the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572, but then we have to add 1? Wait, no, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(layer9)). Wait, no, actually, no, because layer9 is already 1 + 3*(layer8). So, the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, 3*29524=88572. But then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9), which is 88572. But wait, in my earlier computation, I had 88573 as the layer before the final multiplication. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to map the layers correctly.\n\nLet me write the expression with labels:\n\nLet me denote each nested part:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*(E1)\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*(E2)\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*(E3)\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*(E4)\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*(E5)\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*(E6)\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*(E7)\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*(E8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(E9)\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed, I had 3*(88573) = 265,719. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the expression again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n\n11. 3*(88573) = 265,719\n\nWait, so according to this, the expression has 10 layers, with the outermost being the multiplication by 3. So, E1 to E9 are as above, and then the final result is 3*E10, where E10 = 88573.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(E9), which is 3*29524=88572. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I mislabeled the layers. Let me think again.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is E1=4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2=1 +39=40\n\nE4=1 + 3*40=121\n\nE5=1 + 3*121=364\n\nE6=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nE7=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nE8=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nE9=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nE10=1 + 3*29524=88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E10=3*88573=265,719\n\nSo, that's correct. So, the layers are E1 to E10, with E10 being 88573, and the final result is 3*E10=265,719.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation was correct, and the confusion was due to miscounting the layers. So, the final answer is indeed 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nThe structure is similar to a geometric series, but it's recursive. Each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1*(r)^{n-1})/(1 - r). Wait, but since r > 1, this might not converge, but for finite n, we can use the formula.\n\nAlternatively, the solution can be written as a_n = (a_1 + (c)/ (1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - (c)/(1 - r)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to derive it step by step.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nLet's compute a few terms to see the pattern:\n\na1=4\n\na2=1 + 3*4=13\n\na3=1 + 3*13=40\n\na4=1 + 3*40=121\n\na5=1 + 3*121=364\n\na6=1 + 3*364=1093\n\na7=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\na10=1 + 3*29524=88573\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P\n\nSolving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P =1 => P= -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=10: a10=(3^{11} -1)/2=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all the computed terms. So, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the innermost term is a1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another n. Since the expression has 10 layers (from a1 to a10), the final value before the outermost multiplication by 3 is a10=88573.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a10=3*88573=265,719.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the final result can be computed directly without going through each layer. Since the expression has 10 layers, n=10, so a10=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573, and then 3*a10=265,719.\n\nThis confirms that the result is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is recognizing that each layer effectively contributes a power of 3. So, the entire expression can be seen as a sum of powers of 3, but scaled appropriately.\n\nBut given that we've already derived the formula and verified it with multiple steps, I'm confident that the result is accurate.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression involving repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. By systematically simplifying each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Recognizing this pattern allows us to use a closed-form formula derived from a linear recurrence relation, confirming that the final result is 265,719.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the structure of the problem. It seems like a nested expression where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times (1 plus that). So, maybe I can solve this by working from the inside out. That usually works with parentheses.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that part, the next layer out would be 3 times (1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. Each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(that result). Wait, no, actually, looking back, each time it's 3*(1 + previous result). Hmm, maybe I was too quick there.\n\nWait, let's parse this correctly. The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(that 4). So, let's compute that step by step.\n\nLet me try to write this down step by step, working from the inside out.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, the next layer is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have:\n\n3. 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, now the next layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, let's go step by step.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute 3*40: 3*40 = 120.\n\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, step 4 result is 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3*121: 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3*364.\n\n3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093.\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Compute 3*3280.\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Compute 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n3*20000=60000,\n\n3*9000=27000,\n\n3*500=1500,\n\n3*20=60,\n\n3*4=12.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000,\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500,\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560,\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the result of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes, when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each time, the value grows exponentially, which is why the final result is so large.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time it's 3*(1 + previous term). So, it's like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as a_1, then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1), a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2), and so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers of nesting beyond the initial 1+3.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times 3 is multiplied. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nEach \"3*\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3's multiplied.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many 3's are being multiplied?\n\nLet me count the number of 3's before the parentheses:\n\n- The innermost is 3*(1 + 3).\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to see that each layer is a multiplication by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression can be represented as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15? Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 13, but maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Let me define a_1 as the innermost expression:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I had a_2 as 13, but that might have been a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nWait, in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSecond layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThird layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I had different results. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the number of layers is 9, because each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and there are 9 such layers before the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1), a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2), up to a_9, and then the outermost is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n...\n\nEach time, we have a new layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, from the innermost to the outermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count them.\n\nFrom the innermost 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is another layer.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n4. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n6. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n8. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n10. 3*(...)\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\" and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, total layers after the initial 3* is 9, making it 10 layers in total? Or is it 9 layers?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3*(...\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\nAfter the first 3*, we have 1 + 3*(...), which is the first layer.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), which is the second layer.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we have a new opening parenthesis, that's a new layer.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3*?\n\nLet me see:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3*, the first parenthesis is 1 + 3*(...). Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until we reach the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- After the first 3*, the first ( is 1 + 3*(...\n\n- Then inside that, another ( for 1 + 3*(...\n\n- This continues until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3*?\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n9. 3*(1 + 3\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3*, meaning there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the total number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, if I define a_1 as the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier step-by-step calculation where I got 88572. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 steps, starting from 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, then 1+3*121=364, then 1+3*364=1093, then 1+3*1093=3280, then 1+3*3280=9841, then 1+3*9841=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the a_n approach, with a_1=4, a_2=15, a_3=48, a_4=147, a_5=444, a_6=1335, a_7=4008, a_8=12027, a_9=36084, then outermost 3*a_9=108252.\n\nThese two methods are giving different results, so I must have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let's see. In the initial approach, I computed 10 steps, starting from the innermost and moving out, each time computing the next layer. But according to the a_n approach, there are 9 layers, leading to a different result.\n\nSo, which one is correct? Let me parse the original expression again carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3*(...\" layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n4. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n6. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n8. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n10. 3*(...)\n\nWait, so the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is another layer, up to layer 9, and then the outermost is 3*(...), which is layer 10.\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 10, with the first 9 being \"1 + 3*(...)\" and the 10th being the initial 3*.\n\nTherefore, in my initial step-by-step, I correctly computed 10 layers, leading to 88572.\n\nBut in the a_n approach, I considered a_1 to a_9, which would be 9 layers, but perhaps that was missing the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, perhaps the a_n approach should have a_10 as the outermost result.\n\nWait, let me redefine:\n\nLet me define a_1 as the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*49 = 147.\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*148 = 444.\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\na_10 = 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), which is 3 times the result of the inner expression, which has 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial 3* is part of the layer count or not.\n\nIn the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nTherefore, the total number of a_n terms is 9, with a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1), ..., a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8).\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, no, that would make it 10 layers. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that the number of a_n terms is equal to the number of \"1 + 3*(...)\" layers, which is 9, and then the outermost is 3*a_9.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the result after 9 layers.\n\nSo, in that case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 15, a_3 = 48, a_4 = 147, a_5 = 444, a_6 = 1335, a_7 = 4008, a_8 = 12027, a_9 = 36084.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nBut this contradicts my initial step-by-step calculation where I ended up with 88572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers in the initial step-by-step approach. Let me go back to the original expression and count the number of opening parentheses to determine the number of layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*:\n\nEach \"1 + 3*(...\" introduces a new opening parenthesis.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n...\n\nEach time, a new opening parenthesis is added.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\nAfter the initial 3*, the first ( is for 1 + 3*(...\n\nThen, inside that, another ( for 1 + 3*(...\n\nContinuing until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3*?\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n9. 3*(1 + 3\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3*, meaning 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nTherefore, the total number of layers is 9, and the outermost expression is 3*(result of 9 layers).\n\nSo, in my initial step-by-step approach, I computed 10 layers, which included the outermost 3*, but perhaps that was incorrect.\n\nWait, no, in my initial approach, I started with the innermost as layer 1, then each subsequent layer up to the outermost, which would be layer 10.\n\nBut according to the structure, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", and then the outermost is 3*(...), making it 10 layers in total.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the outermost 3* is considered a layer or not.\n\nIn the a_n approach, if I define a_1 as the innermost, then a_2 is 3*(1 + a_1), and so on, up to a_9, and then the outermost is 3*a_9, which would be 3*(a_9), making it 10 layers in total.\n\nBut in the original expression, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), so the outermost is 3*(...), which includes the inner 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after 9 layers.\n\nSo, in that case, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nTherefore, in my initial step-by-step approach, I computed up to a_9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut according to the a_n approach, a_9 is 36084, then 3*a_9 is 108252.\n\nWait, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the a_n approach. Let me try to compute a_n step by step, carefully.\n\nLet me define a_1 as the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, a_9 is 36084.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step approach, I had:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, why the discrepancy? It seems that in one approach, I'm getting 108252, and in the other, 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the layers in the initial approach.\n\nWait, let's parse the original expression again carefully, counting the number of layers.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3*(...)\" layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n4. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n6. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n8. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n10. 3*(...)\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", and then the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, in the a_n approach, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 15, ..., a_9 = 36084, and the outermost is 3*a_9 = 108252.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step approach, I computed 10 layers, starting from 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer up to 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps in the initial step-by-step approach, I miscounted the layers.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It looks like a recursive structure, where each level is 3 times (1 plus something). Since there are multiple layers, maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, the first one is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me see: \n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So let me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. So, L2 is 3*(1 + L1). Since L1 is 4, then 1 + L1 is 5, times 3 is 15. That seems right.\n\nThen, L3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nHmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous result, adding 1, multiplying by 3. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nSo, L4 would be 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nWait a second, 1 + 147 is 148? Yes, because 147 + 1 is 148. So 3 times 148 is 444.\n\nThen, L6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nWait, 1335 + 1 is 1336, times 3 is 4008? Let me check that multiplication. 1336 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. Yes, that's correct.\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let me compute that. 4000*3=12,000, 9*3=27, so 12,000 + 27 = 12,027.\n\nWait, hold on. 4008 + 1 is 4009, right? So 3*4009. Let me compute that again to be sure. 4000*3=12,000, 9*3=27, so 12,000 + 27 = 12,027. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, L9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028. Let me compute that. 12,000*3=36,000, 28*3=84, so 36,000 + 84 = 36,084.\n\nWait, hold on. 12,027 + 1 is 12,028. Then 3*12,028. Let me break it down: 12,000*3=36,000, 28*3=84, so 36,000 + 84 is 36,084. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + L9). So, L10: 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*36,085.\n\nLet me compute that. 36,000*3=108,000, 85*3=255. So, 108,000 + 255 = 108,255.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me confirm: 36,085 * 3. 30,000*3=90,000, 6,000*3=18,000, 85*3=255. So 90,000 + 18,000 = 108,000, plus 255 is 108,255. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3): that's the innermost, so that's 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, we have another 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by a parenthesis.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after a 3 is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, each being 3*(1 + ...). So that means my L1 to L9 correspond to these layers. So, the outermost layer is L9, which I computed as 36,084. Then the entire expression is 3*(1 + L9), which would be 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*36,085 = 108,255.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counting. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. So, how many opening parentheses after the first 3? Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after the first 3: each \"3(\" adds one. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3)\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is L1, up to L9, which is the 9th layer. Then the entire expression is 3*(1 + L9). So, that's 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*36,085 = 108,255.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write out the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1)\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8)\nThen the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + Layer2), where Layer2 is 3*(1 + Layer1), etc. So, actually, the total number of layers is 9, starting from Layer1 to Layer9, with each Layer being 3*(1 + previous Layer). So, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). So, my computation seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me list out each layer's value step by step:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12,027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9) = 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*36,085 = 108,255.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication for Layer9 again. 12,028 * 3. Let me compute that:\n\n12,000 * 3 = 36,000\n\n28 * 3 = 84\n\nSo, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nThen, 1 + 36,084 = 36,085\n\n36,085 * 3: Let's compute that.\n\n30,000 * 3 = 90,000\n\n6,000 * 3 = 18,000\n\n85 * 3 = 255\n\nAdding them up: 90,000 + 18,000 = 108,000; 108,000 + 255 = 108,255.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify each step again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12,027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal computation: 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*36,085 = 108,255 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 108,255.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing it in a different way, maybe by expanding the expression step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous). So, this is similar to a geometric series, perhaps?\n\nLet me think. Each term is 3 times (1 + the previous term). So, if I denote a_n as the nth term, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 is (1 + 3) = 4. Then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, etc.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) = 3A - 3/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nThus, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, but maybe it's better to compute it as is.\n\nLet me compute a_1 using this formula to check:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3 = (11/6)*3^3 - 3/2 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 3/2 = 148.5 - 1.5 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to be working. Therefore, for n=9, which is the number of layers, a_9 would be:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 / 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nCompute 3280 * 11 = 36,080\n\nCompute 0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo, total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nThen, subtract 3/2 = 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation for Layer9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*36,085 = 108,255 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 108,255.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered the problem step by step, checked my work multiple times, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous layer). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 15\\)\n3. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 48\\)\n4. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 147\\)\n5. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 444\\)\n6. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 1335\\)\n7. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 4008\\)\n8. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 12,027\\)\n9. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12,027) = 36,084\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times (1 + 36,084) = 3 \\times 36,085 = 108,255\\).\n\n$\\boxed{108255}$"

That usually works for these kinds of problems. Let me try to write down each layer step by step.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, no, actually, looking at the problem, each time it's 1 + 3*(something). Let me make sure I parse this correctly.\n\nWait, the problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(...))). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's 4, then moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(result from previous)), and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should count how many layers there are.

Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down each step. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since I see there are 9 layers of 1+3.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost (1+3).

So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, let me try to list each layer properly, ensuring I don't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer, and each is wrapped in 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let's count the number of times we have (1+3(...)):\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each (1+3(...)) is another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first (1+3 is one, then each subsequent (1+3 is another. So, let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because I can see that there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write down each step with the correct layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with a_1:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each multiplication step because that's where errors often happen.\n\nStarting again:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3*a_9 = 3*29524\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because sometimes when I do it quickly, I might make a mistake.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. 29,524 *3 can be broken down as:\n\n29,524 *3 = (30,000 - 476) *3 = 30,000*3 - 476*3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers, because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount how many layers you have. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)) sections:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nEach time, it's one more layer until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, so when I computed up to a_9, that's the ninth layer, right? Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of (1+3) sections is 9, each nested inside the previous one. So, yes, a_1 to a_9, each time computing the next layer.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nGiven that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the ninth layer, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it using both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Starting from the innermost layer and working outwards, each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated 9 times, resulting in the final value of 29,524 for the innermost expression. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part, it's 1 plus 3, and each subsequent layer wraps another 3 times (1 plus that result). So, it's like a chain of operations. Maybe if I start simplifying from the inside out, it'll be manageable.\n\nLet me write down the expression step by step. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, looking back at the expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 1+3(1+... parts. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, there are nine such layers. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out.\n\nLet me label each layer from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9. \n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression: 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so Layer 9 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, maybe I should adjust that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost expression:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, the next layer out is 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, the next layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, each time taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let me denote each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is computed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 is 4.\n\nSo, if I can compute a_1 through a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, let me check that. The innermost layer is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so a_9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my initial breakdown, the innermost layer was a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n up to a_9. But in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would correspond to 3*a_9, where a_9 is 29524.\n\nSo, then the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I computed a_9, I got 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut let me go back through each step to check for any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with a_1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me try computing the expression step by step without using the a_n notation, just to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I got earlier. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each step using another method, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such recursive expressions.\n\nI notice that each a_n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r-1)) + (a_1 - c/(r-1)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nSo, plugging in the values: c=1, r=3, a_1=4.\n\nThus, a_n = (1/(3-1)) + (4 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1}.\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (1/2) + (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1}.\n\nWhich is:\n\na_n = 1/2 + (7/2) * 3^{n-1}.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = 1/2 + (7/2)*3^{8}.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = 1/2 + (7/2)*6561.\n\nCompute (7/2)*6561: 7*6561 = 45927, then divide by 2: 45927/2 = 22963.5.\n\nThen, a_9 = 0.5 + 22963.5 = 22964.\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier. Earlier, I had a_9 as 29524, but according to this formula, it's 22964. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps my formula is incorrect. Let me derive it again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 4.\n\nThus, 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as before.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives a_9 =29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nWait, so earlier when I tried using the other approach, I got a different result because I might have made a mistake in setting up the formula. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the particular solution. Let me go through that again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssuming a particular solution of the form A.\n\nSo, A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. That's correct.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular, which is C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2= (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my initial step-by-step computation. So, why did I get 22964 earlier when using the other formula? Because I think I set up the formula incorrectly, perhaps. Let me check that.\n\nEarlier, I thought a_n= (1/(3-1)) + (a_1 -1/(3-1)) *3^{n-1}.\n\nWhich would be a_n=1/2 + (4 -1/2)*3^{n-1}=1/2 + (7/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nBut when n=9, that would be 1/2 + (7/2)*3^8=1/2 + (7/2)*6561=1/2 + (45927)/2= (1 +45927)/2=45928/2=22964.\n\nBut that's different from 29524. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I used earlier is incorrect. Because the standard solution for a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (c/(r-1)) + (a_1 - c/(r-1)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nBut in this case, c=1, r=3, a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_n= (1/(3-1)) + (4 -1/(3-1)) *3^{n-1}=1/2 + (4 -1/2)*3^{n-1}=1/2 + (7/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nBut when n=1, a_1=1/2 + (7/2)*3^{0}=1/2 +7/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:1/2 + (7/2)*3^{1}=1/2 + (7/2)*3=1/2 +21/2=22/2=11. But according to our earlier computation, a_2=13. So, that's inconsistent. Therefore, the formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, so that formula must be wrong. So, I think I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me check.\n\nThe standard formula for a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (c/(r-1)) + (a_1 - c/(r-1)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nBut in this case, when n=2, a_2=1 +3*a_1=1+12=13.\n\nUsing the formula: a_2=1/2 + (7/2)*3^{1}=1/2 +21/2=22/2=11, which is wrong because a_2=13.\n\nThus, the formula must be incorrect. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in setting it up.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a_n= (c/(r-1)) + (a_1 - c/(r-1)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nBut in our case, a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, so c=1, r=3.\n\nThus, a_n= (1/(3-1)) + (a_1 -1/(3-1)) *3^{n-1}=1/2 + (4 -1/2)*3^{n-1}=1/2 + (7/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nBut as we saw, this gives a_2=11, which is wrong. So, perhaps the formula is only applicable when the recurrence starts at n=0 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should adjust the formula to account for the fact that a_1 is the first term after the initial condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the terms starting from n=0. Let me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s define a_0=4, then a_1=1 +3*a_0=1 +12=13, a_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +39=40, etc.\n\nThen, the formula would be a_n= (c/(r-1)) + (a_0 - c/(r-1)) * r^n.\n\nSo, with c=1, r=3, a_0=4.\n\nThus, a_n= (1/2) + (4 -1/2)*3^n=1/2 + (7/2)*3^n.\n\nThen, for n=0: a_0=1/2 + (7/2)*1=1/2 +7/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=1:1/2 + (7/2)*3=1/2 +21/2=22/2=11. But a_1=13. So, that's still wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a_n= (c/(r-1)) + (a_0 - c/(r-1)) * r^{n}.\n\nBut when n=1, that gives 11, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the formula is not applicable here, or I'm misapplying it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is a_n= (c/(r-1)) + (a_1 - c/(r-1)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nBut that also didn't work earlier. So, perhaps the formula is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, since we've already derived the correct formula using the standard method, which gives a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, which correctly gives a_9=29524, and the entire expression as 3*a_9=88572, I can be confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by simplifying it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus the result of the next layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the innermost expression after nine layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost part, each step involves multiplying 3 by the sum of 1 and another similar expression. Maybe I can compute this from the inside out, solving each layer one by one. \n\nLet me write this down step by step. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let me count: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. It seems like there are nine layers of 3*(...) starting from the innermost. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s. Hmm, I think there are nine 3s multiplied by expressions. So, maybe I need to compute this starting from the innermost and work my way out, each time calculating the value inside and substituting it back into the next layer. \n\nLet me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(innermost expression)). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. \n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nNext, L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nThen, L4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. So, in my breakdown, L1 is the innermost 1+3, then each subsequent L is 3*(1 + previous L). So, in total, there are 9 layers, each adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, the final result would be L9, which is 36084. \n\nBut let me verify this step by step because it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Right.\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Yes.\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Right.\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct.\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check L9 again because 12027 + 1 is 12028, and 12028 * 3 is indeed 36084. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*5 = 15, as before. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. So, for n from 2 to 9, we compute each a_n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something else. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write this as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) = 3A - 3/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this: (11/6)*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6 = 11*3^{n-1}/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence. So, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, in my definition, a_1 is the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then a_2 is 3*(1 + a_1), and so on up to a_9. So, a_9 is indeed the value of the entire expression. So, yes, 36084 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this without using the recurrence, just by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, expanding it:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, so each time, it's 3*(1 + something). If I expand this, it might form a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote the innermost as S0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen S1 = 3*(1 + S0) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nS2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nS3 = 3*(1 + S2) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nS4 = 3*(1 + S3) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nS5 = 3*(1 + S4) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nS6 = 3*(1 + S5) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nS7 = 3*(1 + S6) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nS8 = 3*(1 + S7) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, from S0 to S8, which gives us 36084. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for S_n, where S_n = 3*(1 + S_{n-1}), with S_0 = 4.\n\nSo, as before, solving the recurrence, we get S_n = (11*3^{n} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier, I had a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. So, for n=9, it's (11*3^8 -3)/2 = (11*6561 -3)/2 = (72171 -3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of each layer as adding another term in a geometric progression. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step.\n\nWait, let me try to write the entire expression without the parentheses, just to see the pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Wait, no, let me correct that.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from S0 = 4.\n\nThen S1 = 3*(1 + S0) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nS2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nS3 = 3*(1 + S2) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nS4 = 3*(1 + S3) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nS5 = 3*(1 + S4) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nS6 = 3*(1 + S5) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nS7 = 3*(1 + S6) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nS8 = 3*(1 + S7) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, that's consistent again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nEach time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 3. So, perhaps the expression can be represented as a sum involving powers of 3.\n\nWait, considering the recursive formula S_n = 3*(1 + S_{n-1}), with S_0 = 4.\n\nThis can be rewritten as S_n = 3 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nWe can solve it using the method for such recursions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is S_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution of the form S_n^{(p)} = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 3 => -2*A = 3 => A = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition S_0 = 4.\n\nWhen n=0, S_0 = C*3^0 - 3/2 = C - 3/2 = 4.\n\nThus, C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is S_n = (11/2)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWe can factor this as S_n = (11*3^n - 3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=8 (since we start counting from S_0), the value is S_8 = (11*3^8 -3)/2 = (11*6561 -3)/2 = (72171 -3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nWhich again gives us the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, like expanding the entire expression.\n\nLet me try that. The entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, let's compute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))).\n\nSo, each 3*(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let's count the number of 3s after the initial one.\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, from the initial 3, how many times do we have another 3*(...)? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 8 more 3s, each inside another set of parentheses. So, that's 9 layers in total, each adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, that's why we have layers up to L9, giving us 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, such as using exponents or recognizing a pattern in the coefficients.\n\nWait, looking at the values we got for each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 15 = 3*(4 + 1) = 3*5\n\nLayer 3: 48 = 3*(15 + 1) = 3*16\n\nLayer 4: 147 = 3*(48 + 1) = 3*49\n\nLayer 5: 444 = 3*(147 + 1) = 3*148\n\nLayer 6: 1335 = 3*(444 + 1) = 3*445\n\nLayer 7: 4008 = 3*(1335 + 1) = 3*1336\n\nLayer 8: 12027 = 3*(4008 + 1) = 3*4009\n\nLayer 9: 36084 = 3*(12027 + 1) = 3*12028\n\nSo, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the pattern is that each layer is 3*(previous layer + 1).\n\nWhich is exactly the recurrence relation we used earlier. So, using that, we can see that each layer's value is 3 more than three times the previous layer.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it is that each layer is contributing a term that's 3^n, but let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum involving powers of 3.\n\nLet me try to expand the entire expression:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers.\n\nLet me try to write this as 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + previous expression). So, expanding it:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)))\n\nSo, E = 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) = 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nContinuing this way, each time, we have E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n, but I'm not sure if that's exactly the case here.\n\nWait, actually, no, because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but it's not a simple sum. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps if I expand the expression E:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) \n\nLet me denote the inner expression as E', so E = 3*(1 + E').\n\nBut E' itself is similar to E, but with one fewer layer. So, E' = 3*(1 + E''), and so on, until the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation or the recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using binary exponentiation or some other method, but I think the step-by-step approach is straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using a table, computing each layer step by step, to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me create a table where each row represents a layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer | Value\n-----|-------\n1    | 1 + 3 = 4\n2    | 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3    | 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4    | 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5    | 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6    | 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7    | 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8    | 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9    | 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, layer 9 gives us the final value of 36084.\n\nLet me verify each computation again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers compute correctly, and the final value is indeed 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but adjusted for the number of layers. Let me see.\n\nWait, considering the recurrence relation S_n = 3*(1 + S_{n-1}), with S_0 = 4.\n\nWe can expand this as:\n\nS_1 = 3*(1 + S_0) = 3 + 3*S_0 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15.\n\nS_2 = 3*(1 + S_1) = 3 + 3*S_1 = 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48.\n\nS_3 = 3 + 3*S_2 = 3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147.\n\nS_4 = 3 + 3*147 = 3 + 441 = 444.\n\nS_5 = 3 + 3*444 = 3 + 1332 = 1335.\n\nS_6 = 3 + 3*1335 = 3 + 4005 = 4008.\n\nS_7 = 3 + 3*4008 = 3 + 12024 = 12027.\n\nS_8 = 3 + 3*12027 = 3 + 36081 = 36084.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, each time, we're adding 3 and multiplying the previous result by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a sum involving powers of 3, but I think it's more straightforward to stick with the step-by-step computation or the recurrence solution.\n\nIn any case, both methods give me the same result: 36084.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the calculations, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way outward.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the structure of this expression. It seems like there's a pattern here where each part of the expression is 3 times something inside parentheses, and that something inside is another 1 plus 3 times another expression. So it's like a nested expression with multiple layers. Maybe if I work from the innermost parentheses outward, I can compute each part step by step.\n\nLet me try to write this out in a more manageable way. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, let me count how many layers there are here. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 3(...) around it. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep this goes. \n\nStarting from the right, I see each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count: \n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: 1 + 3(...)\n3. Then another layer: 1 + 3(...)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are 9 layers here because each time we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3(...)), and starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n- Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3( Layer 1 )\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3( Layer 2 )\n- ...\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3( Layer 8 )\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. So I need to compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward. That seems manageable. Let me try that.\n\nLet me label each layer for clarity. I'll start with Layer 1 as the innermost expression and work my way up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So my final answer will be 3 multiplied by the result of Layer 9.\n\nOkay, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 2:\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3:\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4:\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5:\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6:\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7:\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8:\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9:\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nAnd 4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right?\n\nBut maybe it's easier to just do straight multiplication:\n\n29524\n*     3\n________\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524\n*     3\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method, maybe adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet me add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. It's easy to make a mistake when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute this. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. As I checked earlier, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and each step seems to follow logically from the previous one. So I feel confident that this is the right solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's going on here. It looks like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by the previous result. So, there are nine layers of this. That seems a bit tedious, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nWait, before I jump into formulas, maybe I should just compute each layer step by step to see if I can spot a pattern. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. \n\nStarting with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's easy, that's 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the second layer is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times 13. So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so the third layer is 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Fourth layer is 121.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, fifth layer is 364.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Sixth layer is 1093.\n\nMoving on, 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Seventh layer is 3280.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Eighth layer is 9841.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that: 3*9841 is... Hmm, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 800 is 2400, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 1 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, the ninth layer is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses all the way out, we have 29524, and then we need to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. Adding those together, 87000 + 1572 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Maybe I miscalculated one of the layers. Let's go through each step again more carefully.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Okay, that's correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that again: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me think if there's a better way to approach this without computing each layer manually, just to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here.\n\nLooking at the structure of the problem, it's a nested expression where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet's write out the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as we can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form formula. Let me try to find that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values we have to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula seems to hold. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Perfect!\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step, I found the value of the innermost expression, then built up each layer until reaching the outermost one. Then, I multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Additionally, by recognizing the recurrence relation, I derived a formula to compute the nth term directly, which confirmed the result without having to compute each layer manually. This helps in verifying the correctness of the solution.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and build up each subsequent layer. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the ninth term directly, confirming the result without manual layer-by-layer computation.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost expression and work outward:\n\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like a recursive or repeated process. Maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1+3). So that's the starting point. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies to 4. Now, the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me check. The next parentheses out would be 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next step is:\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. So now, that simplifies to 13. Next, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So:\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's 40. Continuing this way, let me list each step systematically. Maybe I can make a table or something to keep track.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time, we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3(...)). So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the original expression: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count how many times the pattern 3*(1 + 3*(...)) occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Then, 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Then, 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Then, 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...) terms. Each time, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So let's count:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me see how many layers that is.\n\nFrom the expression, each \"1 +\" is followed by a 3*(...). Let's count the number of \"1 +\" sections:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is another layer.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(...)\" occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems too many. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of \"3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a 3 followed by (.\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers of 3*(...). But the innermost is just (1 + 3), so maybe the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the expression as a tree. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is another similar expression. So, it's a recursive structure where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nWait, so let me clarify:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that would be the total.\n\nBut let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check if I have 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer from the inside out.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: Let's count the number of 3(1 + 3(1 + ...) terms.\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let's count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so:\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try again.\n\nLet me parse the expression step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the total number of layers is 9, starting from (1 + 3) up to the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but let me check if the count is correct. Each time we have a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me try to write down each step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nStep 10: Finally, compute the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but the innermost is step 1, and step 10 is the outermost. So, actually, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the 9 layers inside are steps 1 through 9, and then step 10 is the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the ninth (1 + 3) from the inside out. Then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, in total, we have 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 10, but the computation steps are 9 for the innermost to the ninth layer, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just proceed step by step, computing each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let's list them:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that seems correct. Each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but let me verify the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOutermost layer:\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, all the steps check out. Each calculation seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 +\" appears in the expression, excluding the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 +\" is followed by a 3*(...). Let's count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3(...)\n\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n\n10. 3*(...))\n\nWait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), so the number of \"1 +\" is 9, each followed by a 3*(...). So, that would correspond to 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the outermost 3*(...). So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the total computation is 3*(the result of the 9th layer), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each step again, perhaps using a different approach.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to recognize that each layer follows a pattern. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, but that might be overcomplicating it since the problem only requires computing it step by step.\n\nWait, but just for my own understanding, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + C\n\nWhere A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet's find C. If a_n is in steady state, then a_n = a_{n-1} = C.\n\nSo, C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression can be computed as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is computed as:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by looking at the structure of the problem. It seems like there's a pattern here where each part of the expression is 3 times something, and inside that something, there's another similar expression. So, it's like a nested structure. Maybe if I work from the inside out, I can compute each part step by step.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, okay, so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Got that.\n\nNow, moving one step out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 equals 12. So, that part simplifies to 12.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me make sure I'm doing this right. The next layer out is 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)). So, I think each time, I have 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me try to parse this correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot of steps, but let me check each one carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I count the number of layers, I see that the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me check that again.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, each time adding another 1 + 3(...). So, when I computed up to step 9, I had 29524, and then the outermost 3 times that gives 88572. But let me make sure that each step is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The first is 3(1+3(...)), so inside that, there's another 1+3(...), and so on until the innermost is (1+3). So, how many layers is that?\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), inside it's 1+3(...), which is the second layer, then inside that another 1+3(...), which is the third, and so on until the ninth layer. So, yes, 9 layers, each time 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, my initial calculation of 9 steps, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous), and then the final step is 3*(result from step 9). So, let me go through each step again to make sure.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check each multiplication to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\n1. 3*4 = 12, 1+12=13\n2. 3*13=39, 1+39=40\n3. 3*40=120, 1+120=121\n4. 3*121=363, 1+363=364\n5. 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093\n6. 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280\n7. 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841\n8. 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524\n9. 3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The final step is 3*(29524) which is 88572, but let me verify that multiplication:\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n- The next digit is 9: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2\n- Then, since there are no more digits, we have 2 left, so write down 27.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me do it properly:\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 29,524, which is 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5 *3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n= ?\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4 *3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems to be correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check again the number of layers because I might have miscounted. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. The innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(...\n3. Then another: (1+3(...\n4. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The first is after the first 3: 3(\n- Then, inside that, another ( after 1+3: 3(1+3(\n- Then, another ( after 1+3: 3(1+3(1+3(\n- Continuing this way, each time there's a ( after 1+3.\n\nSo, how many times does 1+3( occur?\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, so 9 times. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, then the final multiplication by 3 is layer 10.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers of 1 + 3*(previous), and then the final 3*(result). So, that would be 10 steps, but perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and then the final 3*(...) is the outermost layer. So, in total, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n- After the first 3, it's 1+3(\n- Then inside that, another 1+3(\n- And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3( occurs, which would indicate the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. The first layer: 3(1+3(\n2. Then inside that: 1+3(\n3. Then another: 1+3(\n4. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, so from the first 3, each time we have 1+3(, which is 9 times, meaning 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3(...). So, that would mean 9 layers of 1 + 3*(previous), and then the outermost 3*(result). So, that's 10 steps in total.\n\nBut in my initial calculation, I had 9 steps of 1 + 3*(previous), and then the 10th step as 3*(result). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 steps, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous), and then the final step as 3*(result). So, that would be 10 computations, but perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's 10 steps, but the first 9 steps are the 1 + 3*(previous), and the 10th step is the outermost 3*(result). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't skip any layers or count any extra layers. Let me write down the expression with the layers numbered:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to make sure. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps for a small number of terms, computing step by step is easier.\n\nBut just to check, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssume a_p is a constant, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n\n-2*a_p = 1\n\na_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n = 2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which also matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for a_n, where n is the layer number, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our case, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost inside is layer 9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part, each time we have 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). Let me try to visualize this.\n\nLet me write it out more clearly, maybe by expanding from the inside out. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + that result). So, perhaps I should start calculating from the inside and work my way outwards. That seems like a logical approach.\n\nSo, let's denote each layer as follows. Let me assign variables to each nested part to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- a = 1 + 3\n- b = 1 + 3a\n- c = 1 + 3b\n- d = 1 + 3c\n- e = 1 + 3d\n- f = 1 + 3e\n- g = 1 + 3f\n- h = 1 + 3g\n- i = 1 + 3h\n\nAnd finally, the entire expression is 3*i. So, if I compute each of these variables step by step, I should be able to find the value of i and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAlright, let me compute each one by one. Starting with a.\n\n1. Compute a = 1 + 3\nThat's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, a = 4.\n\n2. Compute b = 1 + 3a\nWe just found that a = 4, so 3a = 3*4 = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. So, b = 13.\n\n3. Compute c = 1 + 3b\nb is 13, so 3b = 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, c = 40.\n\n4. Compute d = 1 + 3c\nc is 40, so 3c = 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, d = 121.\n\n5. Compute e = 1 + 3d\nd is 121, so 3d = 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, e = 364.\n\n6. Compute f = 1 + 3e\ne is 364, so 3e = 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, f = 1093.\n\n7. Compute g = 1 + 3f\nf is 1093, so 3f = 3*1093. Let me compute that: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, g = 3280.\n\n8. Compute h = 1 + 3g\ng is 3280, so 3g = 3*3280. Let's calculate that: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, h = 9841.\n\n9. Compute i = 1 + 3h\nh is 9841, so 3h = 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. So, adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, i = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*i, so we have 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, right?\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, so 3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72.\n\nLet me add those up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from a:\n\na = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nb = 1 + 3a = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nc = 1 + 3b = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nd = 1 + 3c = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\ne = 1 + 3d = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nf = 1 + 3e = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\ng = 1 + 3f = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nh = 1 + 3g = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\ni = 1 + 3h = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*i = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check the multiplication to be sure.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in computing 3h when h was 9841. So, 3*9841:\n\n9841 \u00d7 3:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write 9, carry 2.\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number, so actually, it's:\n\n9000 + 800 + 40 + 1.\n\nSo, 3*9000 = 27000\n3*800 = 2400\n3*40 = 120\n3*1 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, i = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*i = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another step to be thorough. Let's say when we computed f = 1 + 3e, where e was 364.\n\n3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, when we computed g = 1 + 3f, f=1093.\n\n3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nh = 1 + 3g, g=3280.\n\n3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think. Each time, we're doing 3*(1 + previous term). So, this is a geometric series or something similar? Wait, but it's not exactly a geometric series because each term is 3 times (1 plus the next term), which might form a recurrence relation.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so maybe a_1 is the innermost, and each subsequent a_n is built by adding another layer. So, let me see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think about it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = k*(a_{n-1} + c), where k and c are constants.\n\nIn this case, k=3 and c=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found by expanding it:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\n= 3*1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSimilarly, a_{n-1} = 3*(1 + a_{n-2})\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*(3*(1 + a_{n-2})) = 3 + 3^2*(1 + a_{n-2})\n\nContinuing this way, we can see that after n steps, it would be:\n\na_n = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n + 3^n * a_0\n\nWait, but our initial condition is a_1 = 4, which is after one step. Wait, perhaps it's better to index it starting from a_0.\n\nLet me adjust that. Let me set a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 3*(1 + a_0) = 3*(1 + 1) = 6? Wait, but in our problem, the innermost term is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, so maybe I need to adjust the indexing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me test that with n=1: (3^{2} - 3)/2 = (9 - 3)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Hmm, but a_1 in our problem is 4, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the general formula. Let me try to derive it properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me expand it:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's use n=1, a_1=4.\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1.5\n\n3A = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5\n\nA = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\n(11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\n(11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. But wait, from our earlier computation, a_2 was 13. Hmm, that's a problem. So, my general formula seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the initial condition.\n\nWait, when I set up the recurrence, I considered a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nBut when I applied the initial condition, I used n=1. Maybe I should check n=0 as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the indexing. Let me try again.\n\nLet me define a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is the innermost term. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on.\n\nWait, so if I set a_0 = 4, then the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), for n >= 1.\n\nSo, the initial condition is a_0 = 4.\n\nThen, the homogeneous solution is still A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, let's try a constant C again.\n\nSo, C = 3*(1 + C)\n\nC = 3 + 3C\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition at n=0:\n\na_0 = 4 = A*3^0 - 3/2 = A - 3/2\n\nSo, A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/2)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 3)/2\n\nLet me test this for n=0:\n\n(11*1 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=1:\n\n(11*3 - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Wait, but from our earlier computation, a_1 was 13, not 15. Hmm, that's a problem. So, my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Let me check.\n\nWait, in our problem, the innermost term is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is a_2. Wait, but in our earlier step-by-step, a_2 was 13. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. Wait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving out, the next is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, which seems inconsistent with this.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the indexing earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but that's only 8 layers, but the problem has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of 3*(1+...) parts.\n\nWait, let me see: starting from the innermost (1+3), then each 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer. So, the number of layers is 9, because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each time there's another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count the number of 3(1+3( parts.\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, when I was computing earlier, I had a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, up to a_9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut when I tried to compute the layers manually, starting from the innermost, I got a different result. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my manual computation.\n\nWait, let me try again, starting from the innermost layer and working outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but according to this, the outermost layer is 36084, and then the entire expression is 3*(that), so 3*36084 = 108252. But that's conflicting with my earlier result of 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I computed using the variables a through i, I got 88572. So, where am I going wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...)).\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each time there's another 3(1+3(...)). Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 36084, then the entire expression is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed using a_1 to a_9, I got a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach using variables a to i was incorrect in the way I defined them. Let me check that again.\n\nIn my first approach, I defined:\n\na = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nb = 1 + 3a = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nc = 1 + 3b = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nd = 1 + 3c = 1 + 120 = 121\n\ne = 1 + 3d = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nf = 1 + 3e = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\ng = 1 + 3f = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nh = 1 + 3g = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\ni = 1 + 3h = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*i = 88572.\n\nBut when I computed layer by layer, starting from the innermost, I got Layer 9 as 36084, leading to 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nThese two results are different, so one of the methods is wrong. Let me see where.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the layers in the first approach. Let me try to map the two approaches.\n\nIn the first approach, I defined a as the innermost (1+3)=4. Then, b was 1 + 3a = 13, which corresponds to Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15, but wait, in the first approach, I had b = 13, which is 1 + 3a, but in the layer-by-layer approach, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is different.\n\nWait, so perhaps the first approach is not correctly modeling the expression because it's not multiplying by 3 at each step.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I defined each subsequent variable as 1 + 3*(previous variable), but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, perhaps the first approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I had a = 1 + 3, which is correct. Then, b = 1 + 3a, but in reality, the next layer is 3*(1 + a), which is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, not 1 + 3a.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake in the first approach by not including the multiplication by 3 correctly. Instead of defining each variable as 1 + 3*previous, I should have defined each variable as 3*(1 + previous).\n\nSo, let me correct that.\n\nLet me redefine the variables correctly, ensuring that each step is 3*(1 + previous).\n\nLet me start over.\n\nLet me define:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 3*(1 + a1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na3 = 3*(1 + a2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na4 = 3*(1 + a3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na5 = 3*(1 + a4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na6 = 3*(1 + a5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na7 = 3*(1 + a6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na8 = 3*(1 + a7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na9 = 3*(1 + a8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, that's different from my first approach because in the first approach, I incorrectly modeled the recurrence as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} instead of a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, that was my mistake. The first approach incorrectly added 1 and then multiplied by 3, but in reality, it's multiply by 3 after adding 1. So, the correct way is to compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nTherefore, the correct result should be 108252, not 88572.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I had a9 = 29524, then 3*a9 = 88572, which is wrong because I was using the wrong recurrence.\n\nSo, to correct this, let me compute each layer properly, starting from the innermost and moving outward, computing each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nLet me do that step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because my initial step-by-step approach gave me 88572, but upon correcting the recurrence, I get 108252. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of the problem to test which approach is correct.\n\nLet me take a smaller version with fewer layers. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute both ways.\n\nFirst, using the correct method:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nEntire expression: 3*15 = 45.\n\nAlternatively, using the incorrect recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 4:\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nEntire expression: 3*13 = 39.\n\nBut the correct value is 45, so the correct approach is the layer-by-layer method.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach using variables a to i was incorrect because I didn't properly model the 3*(1 + ...) structure. Instead, I added 1 and then multiplied by 3, which is different.\n\nSo, the correct result should be 108252.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another smaller example to be sure.\n\nLet me take 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute using the correct method:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nEntire expression: 3*48 = 144.\n\nUsing the incorrect method:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nEntire expression: 3*40 = 120.\n\nBut the correct value is 144, so the layer-by-layer method is correct, and the initial approach was wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the original problem is 108252.\n\nWait, but I'm now getting confused because the initial step-by-step approach gave me 88572, but upon correcting the method, I get 108252. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial approach by not correctly applying the 3*(1 + ...) structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 108252.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it again using the correct layer-by-layer approach, just to be thorough.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, expanding it:\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value at layer n.\n\nThen, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + L_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + L_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by looking at the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a series of nested expressions where each one is 1 plus 3 times something. So, it's like 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (and so on))). Since there are multiple layers, maybe I can solve it starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are here. Starting from the inside, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. Let me see: the innermost part is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), and this repeats. Let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(...))\n3. Then another, and so on.\n\nWait, let me actually count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, after the first 3, there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 3 times (1 plus 3 times (another set)). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nFirst, the innermost expression is (1+3). Then, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, if I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside, that should work.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step.\n\nLet's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, let's see: the innermost is (1+3), which is L1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(L1), which would be L2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(L2), which is L3, and so on, until we reach L9, which is the outermost layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9).\n\nSo, let me write that down:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, I can compute L1 through L9 step by step.\n\nLet me compute each Li:\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. L2 is 13.\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 40. That's getting bigger.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n121, wow, this is growing quickly.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n364, okay.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n1093. That's a pretty big number.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3280. Hmm, this is getting really large.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9841. Wow, that's almost 10,000.\n\nFinally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n29524. So, L9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 29524 is 29,524.\n\nSo, 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, but since it's 29,524, which is 30,000 - 476.\n\nSo, 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 3*476.\n\nCompute 3*476: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200+210=1410+18=1428.\n\nSo, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that because 29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3 step by step.\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n_________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*L9 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: As computed earlier, that's 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar, which might give a quicker way to compute the result without expanding each layer.\n\nLet me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nLet me denote the nth term as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but maybe this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for each step. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThus, the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a formula for a_n, we could directly compute a_9 using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\nBut regardless of the method, both step-by-step computation and the formula lead to the same result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\n= (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the structure of the expression. It's a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So it's like 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (... and so on. Since it's nested multiple times, maybe I can compute it from the innermost parentheses outward. That seems like a logical approach because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+...). Let me see: the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is used after the initial one. Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of closing parentheses. Let's see: starting from the end, each closing parenthesis corresponds to an opening one. So from the end, we have 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So from the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers in total? Wait, no, let's see. The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that, so perhaps 9 layers? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(result of step 1)\n3. 1+3*(result of step 2)\n...\nEach step adds another layer until we reach the outermost one. So how many steps? Let's see, starting from the innermost, each step is a layer. So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each time we have a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, and each parenthesis is 1 plus another 3 times another parenthesis. So it's like a recursive structure. Maybe I can represent this as a function. Let's define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). And the base case would be f(1) = 1 + 3. Wait, actually, when n=1, it's just 1+3, right? Because the innermost layer is 1+3. So f(1) = 4. Then f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5=15. Then f(3)=3*(1 + f(2))=3*(1+15)=3*16=48. Hmm, wait, maybe this is a better approach.\n\nSo, if I define f(n) as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as f(1), then each subsequent layer is f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). So let me compute this step by step.\n\nLet's start:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so f(9) is 36084. But let me check: is the number of layers 9? Let me recount. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, each time it's 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nFrom the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Let's see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer is another 3(...). So let's count the number of 3s after the first one. The first 3 is the outermost, then each inner layer adds another 3. So the number of layers is 9 because the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 3(...). So total layers are 9, which means f(9) is the final result.\n\nWait, but in my function f(n), f(1)=4, f(2)=15, up to f(9)=36084. So the total value is 36084. But let me verify this because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step without defining the function. Let's try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but that's 9 layers, and the final result is 29524. But earlier, using the function approach, I got 36084. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think I messed up the function approach. Let me check again. Maybe I confused the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the function approach, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting with f(1)=4.\n\nBut when I computed f(9), I got 36084, but when computing step by step, starting from the innermost, I got 29524. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me compute the step-by-step approach again, carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo after 9 layers, the result is 29524. Therefore, the final answer is 29524.\n\nWait, but in the function approach, I had f(9)=36084. So I must have made a mistake in the function approach. Let me see where.\n\nIn the function approach, I defined f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)) with f(1)=4.\n\nSo:\n\nf(1)=4\n\nf(2)=3*(1+4)=15\n\nf(3)=3*(1+15)=48\n\nf(4)=3*(1+48)=147\n\nf(5)=3*(1+147)=444\n\nf(6)=3*(1+444)=1335\n\nf(7)=3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nf(8)=3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nf(9)=3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nWait, but this is different from the step-by-step approach. So which one is correct? Let me check the step-by-step approach again, because I think that's more accurate.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step approach, starting from the innermost, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous result). So the first layer is 4, then 13, 40, etc., up to 29524. So that seems correct.\n\nBut in the function approach, f(n) is defined as 3*(1 + f(n-1)), which would be the outermost layer. Wait, maybe I confused the order. Let me think.\n\nWait, in the function approach, f(n) is the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So f(1)=4 is the innermost, f(2)=15 is the next layer out, etc., up to f(9)=36084. But in the step-by-step approach, I computed the innermost as 4, then 13, etc., which is f(2)=13, f(3)=40, etc. So perhaps the function approach is misaligned with the step-by-step.\n\nWait, perhaps the function approach is counting the layers differently. Let me try to align them.\n\nIf f(1)=4 (innermost), then f(2)=13, f(3)=40, f(4)=121, f(5)=364, f(6)=1093, f(7)=3280, f(8)=9841, f(9)=29524.\n\nWait, so in the function approach, I was using f(n)=3*(1 + f(n-1)), but that would be the case if f(n) is the outermost layer. Wait, no, perhaps the function approach is incorrect because each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), but the step-by-step approach is correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo the total number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. So each layer is computed as 3*(1 + previous layer). So the first layer (innermost) is 1+3=4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4)=15. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15)=48, and so on, until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step approach, I computed 9 layers, starting from 4, then 13, 40, etc., which seems different from the function approach. So I think I made a mistake in the function approach. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the function approach is correct, but the step-by-step approach is misaligned. Let me see:\n\nIf f(1)=4, then f(2)=3*(1 + f(1))=3*(5)=15\n\nf(3)=3*(1 + f(2))=3*(16)=48\n\nf(4)=3*(1 + f(3))=3*(49)=147\n\nf(5)=3*(1 + f(4))=3*(148)=444\n\nf(6)=3*(1 + f(5))=3*(445)=1335\n\nf(7)=3*(1 + f(6))=3*(1336)=4008\n\nf(8)=3*(1 + f(7))=3*(4009)=12027\n\nf(9)=3*(1 + f(8))=3*(12028)=36084\n\nSo according to this, the outermost layer is 36084. But in the step-by-step approach, starting from the innermost, I got 29524. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the step-by-step approach is wrong because I didn't start correctly. Let me try again.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step approach, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but according to the function approach, f(9)=36084. So where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nEach layer adds another 1+3(...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times the pattern 1+3( occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nFrom the start, after the first 3, each 1+3( adds a new layer. So starting from the first 3, the first inner is 1+3, then each subsequent is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n\n2. 1+3(1+3(\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(\n\n9. 1+3(1+3)\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers, each adding a 1+3(...). Therefore, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1+3. Then each layer wraps around that. So the outermost layer is the first one, which is 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo in the function approach, f(9) is the outermost layer, which is 36084. But in the step-by-step approach, I started from the innermost and computed outward, getting 29524. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step approach. Let me see: in the function approach, each f(n) is the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as f(1)=4. Then each subsequent layer is f(n)=3*(1 + f(n-1)). So f(2)=15, which would be the second layer from the innermost, which is 3*(1 + 4)=15. Then f(3)=3*(1 +15)=48, which would be the third layer, etc., up to f(9)=36084.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, I computed starting from the innermost as 4, then next layer as 13, which is 1 + 3*4=13, which would be f(2)=13, but according to the function approach, f(2)=15. So there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let's clarify: the function approach defines f(n) as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as f(1)=4. Then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So f(2)=3*(1 +4)=15, f(3)=3*(1 +15)=48, etc.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, starting from the innermost as 4, the next layer is 1 + 3*4=13, which is different from f(2)=15. Therefore, the function approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the function definition. Let me think again.\n\nIf the function approach is f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1)=4, then f(2)=3*(1 +4)=15, which is correct. Then f(3)=3*(1 +15)=48, which is correct, and so on. So the function approach is correct, and the step-by-step approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step approach, I computed the next layer as 1 + 3*previous. But according to the function approach, the next layer is 3*(1 + previous). So which is it?\n\nWait, looking back at the original expression: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Therefore, when computing from the innermost outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So the innermost is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 +4)=15, then the next is 3*(1 +15)=48, and so on.\n\nBut in my step-by-step approach earlier, I mistakenly computed the next layer as 1 + 3*previous, which is incorrect. It should be 3*(1 + previous). So I made a mistake in the step-by-step approach.\n\nLet me correct that. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 +4)=3*5=15\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 +15)=3*16=48\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 +48)=3*49=147\n\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 +147)=3*148=444\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 +444)=3*445=1335\n\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 +1335)=3*1336=4008\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 +4008)=3*4009=12027\n\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 +12027)=3*12028=36084\n\nSo the correct result is 36084. Therefore, the function approach was correct, and I made a mistake in the step-by-step approach by incorrectly computing the next layer as 1 + 3*previous instead of 3*(1 + previous). That's where the discrepancy came from.\n\nSo the correct answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By carefully evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer is three times the sum of 1 and the result of the next inner layer. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers, leading to the final result of 36084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3(4).

Wait, no, 29525 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 5 (units).

It's easy to make an error with so many layers.\n\nLet me recount the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4.

Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, hold on, in step 10, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's see. When I had 3*(29524), I thought it was 88575, but now I'm getting 88572.\n\nWait, let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nThen, step 10 is 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I had step 10 as 3*(29525) = 88575, but now I'm confused because in the previous step, I had 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next step is 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier when I thought it was 88575. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, after step 9, we have 29524.\n\nThen, step 10: 3*(29524) = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nThen, the expression becomes 3*(88573). Wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, in my initial breakdown, I had 10 steps, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to recount all the steps properly.\n\nWait, the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I went too far. Let me recount:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is step 1: 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, step 10: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), so after step 9, we have 29524, and then the next step is 3*(29524) = 88572, but that's not the end yet because the expression is 3*(1 + ...). Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3)\n\nThen, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\n2. 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\n3. 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\n4. 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\n5. 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\n6. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\n7. 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\n8. 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\n9. 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(88572) = 265716.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought it was 88575, but now I'm getting 265716.\n\nWait, I think I confused myself with the number of layers. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should evaluate each layer one by one, keeping track of each result.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start from the innermost layer and work my way outwards.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88575. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572, not 88575. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 layers, but actually, the expression has 9 layers. So, I think I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, L1 to L9 as I defined earlier, and then the final result is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I first did the steps, I had 10 steps, but that was incorrect because I included an extra step beyond the 9 layers. So, the correct final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure.\n\nThe problem is:\n\nCompute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nCounting the number of 3*(1 + ...), let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3)\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses: each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer.\n\nSo, from L1 to L9, as I defined earlier, and then the final result is 3*(L9) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88575, but that was a miscalculation because I thought L9 was 29525 instead of 29524.\n\nWait, let's go back to L9:\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers again. Let me try a different approach by expanding the expression step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n1. Compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nNext, compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))))))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))))))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)))))))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(9841)))))))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(29524)))))))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, hold on, that's different from before. So, the next step is 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nThen, the expression becomes:\n\n3(88573)))))))))\n\nFinally, compute 3*88573.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + ...), so after the last layer, we have 3*(88573).\n\nCompute 3*88573:\n\n88573 \u00d7 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me do it properly:\n\n88573 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, write down the 2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 88573 is a 5-digit number, so:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n  8 8 5 7 3\n\u00d7         3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, write down the 2.\n\nWait, that would make it 265719.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me compute it differently.\n\nCompute 88573 \u00d7 3:\n\n80,000 \u00d7 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 \u00d7 3 = 24,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n70 \u00d7 3 = 210\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\nAdding them up:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, so if the last step is 3*(88573) = 265,719, then that would be the final answer.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 88,572.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong?\n\nI think I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), so after 9 layers, we have 29524, as before.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my previous step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after each layer, we have another 3*(1 + ...), and the total number of layers is 9.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nBut in my other approach, I ended up with 3*(88573) = 265,719, which must be wrong because I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to visualize the expression better.\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer clearly:\n\nStart with:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think the confusion arose because in my earlier step-by-step, I mistakenly continued beyond the 9 layers, leading to an incorrect result. So, the correct approach is to compute up to L9 and then multiply by 3, resulting in 88,572.\n\nTo confirm, let me compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Substitute and compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like a repeated pattern, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works for these kinds of problems, right? Let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nSo, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). Let me write that:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so that gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(result from step 2). Let's compute that:\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's 40. Continuing outward, the next layer is again 1 + 3*(previous result). So:\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 121? That seems a bit big, but okay. Let me check my steps so far. So, step 1: 1+3=4, step 2: 1+3*4=13, step 3: 1+3*13=40, step 4: 1+3*40=121. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Let me calculate that:\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWow, that's getting big quickly. So, 364. Moving outward, next is 1 + 3*(364). Let me do that:\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nOkay, 1093. Next layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that:\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3280? Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Yeah, that's right.\n\nMoving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me calculate that:\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9841. That's a pretty large number, but okay. Next layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me do that:\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWow, 29524. That's almost 30,000. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that:\n\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n88573. That's a huge number. Now, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 10). So, let's calculate that:\n\n11. Outermost layer: 3*(88573) = 265,719\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n11. 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nWait, 3*88,573. Let me compute that again to be sure. 88,573 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 * 3 = 24,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n70 * 3 = 210\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 265,719.\n\nBut wait, that seems really large. Let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nLet me see, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on, how many times?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, starting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied, which is 9 times. Wait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3*(1)\n3. 1+3*(2)\n4. 1+3*(3)\n5. 1+3*(4)\n6. 1+3*(5)\n7. 1+3*(6)\n8. 1+3*(7)\n9. 1+3*(8)\n10. 3*(9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(result). So, total of 10 steps, but the initial 3 is step 10, and the innermost is step 1.\n\nBut when I computed earlier, I went up to step 11, which was 3*(result from step 10). So, maybe my counting is correct.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + 3*(...) appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then 3*(1+3*(...))\n3. Then another 3*(1+3*(...))\n...\nSo, how many times does 3*(1+3*(...) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, that's 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, and then the outermost 3*(...). So, total steps would be 10: 9 inner layers plus the outermost multiplication.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 10 layers (steps 1 through 10), and then step 11 was the outermost 3*(result). Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then each time we go out, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer adds one more step.\n\nSo, let me list the steps with their corresponding layers:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\n10. Layer 10: 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n\n11. Outermost: 3*(88573) = 265,719\n\nSo, actually, there are 10 layers, where layers 1 through 9 are the innermost to the one before the outermost, and then the outermost is 3*(layer 10). So, that's why I had 11 steps.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is structured with 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), so maybe I overcounted. Let me try to recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 9 instances of 3*(1 + ...). So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...) up to layer 9, and then the outermost is 3*(result of layer 9). Wait, no, actually, the outermost is the first 3, so perhaps it's 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost (1 + 3). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n\n11. 3*(88573) = 265,719\n\nSo, actually, there are 10 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 9 layers, and then the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me think of it as a tree. The outermost operation is 3*(...). The ... is 1 + 3*(...), which is another layer. So, each time, we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and this repeats 9 times, with the innermost being (1 + 3). So, the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...) is 9, and then the outermost is 3*(result). So, in terms of steps, we have 9 inner layers and then one outer multiplication, totaling 10 steps, but in my earlier computation, I had 11 steps because I included the outermost multiplication as step 11.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute it again, but this time, I'll count the number of layers properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n\n11. 3*(88573) = 265,719\n\nWait, so that's 11 steps. But the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe I'm including the outermost 3*(...) as step 11, but perhaps the count is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without manually calculating each step, which might be error-prone.\n\nLet me think about this. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 265,719.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify each step again:\n\n1. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. a_10 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n11. Final result = 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the calculations are consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 265,719.\n\nI don't think I made any arithmetic errors this time, as I double-checked each step. So, I think this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each step is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Outermost layer: 3*88573 = 265,719\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{265719}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive expression where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by the previous result. So, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. Continue this process until all layers are done.\n\nSo, let's start from the very inside.\n\n**Step 1:** Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3.\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, the innermost part becomes 4.\n\n**Step 2:** Now, move one layer out. The next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). Since Step 1 was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nSo, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\n**Step 3:** Moving another layer out, the expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). Step 2 gave us 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nSo, now we have 40.\n\n**Step 4:** Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 3). Step 3 was 40, so it's 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nAlright, moving on.\n\n**Step 5:** Next, 1 + 3*(result from Step 4). Step 4 was 121, so 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nHmm, okay, getting bigger.\n\n**Step 6:** Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 5). Step 5 was 364, so 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nSo, now we have 1093.\n\n**Step 7:** Next expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 6). Step 6 was 1093, so 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating 3*1093: Let me do this step by step. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nSo, Step 7 gives us 3280.\n\n**Step 8:** Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 7). Step 7 was 3280, so 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nAlright, moving on.\n\n**Step 9:** Next expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 8). Step 8 was 9841, so 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nSo, Step 9 gives us 29524.\n\nWait, but looking back at the original problem, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer.\n\nLooking at it: There are nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, we have nine layers. Wait, but in my steps above, I went up to Step 9, which was 29524. But the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by the entire thing. So, after computing the innermost nine layers, which give 29524, we have to multiply that by 3, right?\n\nWait, no, actually, let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers of 1+3(...). So, when I did Step 1 through Step 9, I was computing each layer from the inside out, ending up with the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is 29524. So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that 29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I thought each step was moving out one layer, but actually, each step is moving out one layer, so after nine steps, I should have computed the entire inner part, and then I need to multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(...). The innermost part is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the total number of layers is nine, right?\n\nWait, let me count the number of 1+3( parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to nine layers.\n\nSo, in my initial steps, I computed each layer, starting from the innermost, so after nine steps, I would have the value of the innermost nine layers, which is 29524, as per Step 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that 29524. So, the final step would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial counting, I thought I had nine layers, but when I started computing, I went up to Step 9 as 29524, which is the innermost nine layers, so the outermost multiplication by 3 is still pending.\n\nWait, let me verify. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is nine, each adding another 1+3*(...). So, when I computed up to Step 9, I got 29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nFinally, 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recount the layers and the computations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, after nine layers, we get 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing it another way. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something like that, but given the structure, it's a nested multiplication, so each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's similar to a geometric progression but not exactly because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a base case and see if there's a pattern.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, indeed, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, using the recurrence relation, finding a closed-form formula, and verifying each step. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.\n\n1.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So, maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier. That usually helps with these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, okay, so the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So, the next layer is 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 3 * 4 = 12\n\nSo, the next part becomes 1 + 12. Let me compute that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, the structure is 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, I have:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen, moving out, the next expression is 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, but hold on. Is the next layer after 3*(4) equal to 12, and then that is inside another 1 + 3*(...). So, the next step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, in this case, 1 + 3*(4) is 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 3*(13) because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me compute that.\n\nFourth layer: 3 * 13 = 39\n\nThen, the next expression is 1 + 39 = 40\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, so each time we're computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after getting 13, we multiply by 3 to get 39, then add 1 to get 40. That seems correct.\n\nContinuing this way, let me try to list each layer step by step.

Earlier, I thought there were 9 layers, but now I'm getting 9 layers and the final result is 88572. But when I did the previous counting, I got 10 layers and 1092, which seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+... terms. Each time, after the first 3, we have another 3(1 + ... inside. So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\nFirst: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me try to write it as:\n\nLet me denote the innermost as E1: E1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, until E9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, let me check the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent (1 + 3(...) adds another set. So, the original expression has 9 layers of nesting. So, we have E1 to E9.\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(E9). So, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 9 layers, I ended up with 88572, but when I tried to count before, I thought it was 10 layers and got 1092, which was conflicting.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion arises from how we count the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the innermost expression is E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, etc., up to E9.\n\nTherefore, the total number of layers is 9, starting from E1 to E9, and the final expression is 3*E9.\n\nSo, computing step by step:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because 88572 seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error somewhere.\n\nLet me go through each step again carefully.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final result is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), and each subsequent 3(1+...) is one layer. Let's count the number of 3(1+...:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer2 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer3) = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer4 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer5) = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer6 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer7) = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer8 = 364\n\nLayer10: 3*(Layer9) = 1092\n\nWait, now I'm confused again. Earlier, I thought there were 9 layers, but now when I count the layers as operations, I get 10 layers, ending up with 1092.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1 + ... is a new layer. So, let's see:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is layer 1.\n\nInside that, we have another (1 + 3(...)), which is layer 2.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3( ... )) parts:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\n2. Then, moving out, we have (1 + 3*(layer1)), which is layer 2.\n\n3. Then, (1 + 3*(layer2)), layer3.\n\nContinuing until we reach the outermost.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 12\n\nLayer3: 1 + Layer2 = 13\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3) = 39\n\nLayer5: 1 + Layer4 = 40\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 120\n\nLayer7: 1 + Layer6 = 121\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 363\n\nLayer9: 1 + Layer8 = 364\n\nLayer10: 3*(Layer9) = 1092\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer10). So, the final result is 3*1092 = 3276.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused because earlier I thought there were 9 layers, but now I'm getting 10 layers and a different result.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression again. Maybe I should write down each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. Next: 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4. Next: 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. Next: 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. Next: 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. Next: 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. Next: 1 + 363 = 364\n\n10. Next: 3*(364) = 1092\n\n11. Next: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n12. Next: 3*(1093) = 3279\n\n13. Next: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n14. Next: 3*(3280) = 9840\n\n15. Next: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n16. Next: 3*(9841) = 29523\n\n17. Next: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n18. Next: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, now I'm getting 18 layers, which can't be right because the original expression only has 9 layers of nesting.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of 3(1+... terms in the expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. So, the number of 3(1+... terms is equal to the number of layers.\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+... terms:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one.\n\n- Inside that, another 3(1 + ...), so that's two.\n\n- Continuing this way, how many times does 3(1 + ... appear?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) - 1\n\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) - 2\n\nWait, this isn't helpful. Maybe I should think about how many times we have a 3 multiplied by a sum.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of multiplications by 3. Each layer involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1.\n\nWait, let me try to model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define E(n) as the expression with n layers. So, E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1))\n\nAnd E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, E(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but earlier I had E1 = 4, E2 = 13. Hmm, inconsistency here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps my definition is off. Let me redefine.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1)\n\nWith E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen E(2) = 1 + 3*E(1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE(3) = 1 + 3*E(2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE(4) = 1 + 3*E(3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE(5) = 1 + 3*E(4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE(6) = 1 + 3*E(5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE(7) = 1 + 3*E(6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE(8) = 1 + 3*E(7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE(9) = 1 + 3*E(8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final expression is 3*E(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers or 8 layers.\n\nBecause E(1) is the innermost, and E(9) is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, the original expression is 3*(E(9)), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for E(n).\n\nThe recurrence relation is E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E(n) = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nE(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1)\n\nAssume E(n) = A*3^n + B\n\nThen,\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E(n) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E(1) = 4\n\nE(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, E(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9,\n\nE(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*E(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the original expression is 3*(E(9)), and E(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, then:\n\nFinal result = 3*(3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. Starting from the innermost part, each layer is computed by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. By systematically working from the inside out, each layer's value is determined. Using a recurrence relation, the expression is solved, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 3*(1 + ...). Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...) operation.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(3 \\times 13 = 39\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(3 \\times 121 = 363\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 364 = 1092\\)\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating the number of layers, it's clear that the correct number of layers is 9, leading to the final computation:\n\n4. **Recurrence Relation**: Define \\(E(n) = 1 + 3 \\times E(n-1)\\) with \\(E(1) = 4\\). Solving this recurrence gives \\(E(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), \\(E(9) = 29524\\).\n\n5. **Final Result**: Multiply \\(E(9)\\) by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part, each time we have 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That sounds like a plan.\n\nSo, let's write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. So, starting from the innermost one, which is (1 + 3), and moving outwards, each time I compute the innermost expression, replace it, and then compute the next layer. That should simplify the problem step by step.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, I'll compute each layer step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses**\n\nStarting with the innermost part: (1 + 3). That's straightforward.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, now, replace that part with 4. The next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let's compute that.\n\n**Step 2: Compute 1 + 3*(4)**\n\nFirst, compute 3*4.\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nThen, add 1 to that result.\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that.\n\n**Step 3: Compute 1 + 3*(13)**\n\nFirst, compute 3*13.\n\n3 * 13 = 39\n\nThen, add 1 to that result.\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, now, this layer simplifies to 40. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(40). Let's do that.\n\n**Step 4: Compute 1 + 3*(40)**\n\nFirst, compute 3*40.\n\n3 * 40 = 120\n\nThen, add 1 to that result.\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nSo, this layer becomes 121. Next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute that.\n\n**Step 5: Compute 1 + 3*(121)**\n\nFirst, 3*121.\n\n3 * 121 = 363\n\nThen, add 1.\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo, this layer simplifies to 364. Moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(364). Let's calculate that.\n\n**Step 6: Compute 1 + 3*(364)**\n\nFirst, 3*364.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 364 * 3. Let's break it down: 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nSo, 3*364 = 1092\n\nThen, add 1.\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSo, this layer becomes 1093. Next layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that.\n\n**Step 7: Compute 1 + 3*(1093)**\n\nFirst, 3*1093.\n\nLet me compute 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nSo, 3*1093 = 3279\n\nThen, add 1.\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nSo, this layer simplifies to 3280. Moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute that.\n\n**Step 8: Compute 1 + 3*(3280)**\n\nFirst, 3*3280.\n\nHmm, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.\n\nSo, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nSo, 3*3280 = 9840\n\nThen, add 1.\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nSo, this layer becomes 9841. Next layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute that.\n\n**Step 9: Compute 1 + 3*(9841)**\n\nFirst, 3*9841.\n\nLet me break this down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523\n\nThen, add 1.\n\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, this layer simplifies to 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 3*(29524). Let's compute that.\n\n**Step 10: Compute 3*(29524)**\n\nAlright, so 3 multiplied by 29524. Let's compute that.\n\nI can break it down as follows:\n\n29524 * 3 = ?\n\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n----------\n\nLet's compute:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5 * 3 =15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 =27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 =6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 +1=5.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\nNow, add 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 =6 +1=7\n\n0 + 5 =5\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers.\n\nLet me recap the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\n3. 1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\n4. 1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\n5. 1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\n6. 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\n7. 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\n8. 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\n9. 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\n10. 3*29524=88572\n\nEach step seems correct. So, I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process, but since I'm just starting out, breaking it down step by step seems the most straightforward approach.\n\nWait, let me think if there's a better way. Maybe recognizing that this expression is similar to a geometric series or something like that.\n\nLooking at the structure: each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, it's like a repeated multiplication and addition.\n\nBut since there are nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually, as I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a_1, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on until a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in this case, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\na_2 = 1 +3*a1=1+12=13\n\na3=1+3*a2=1+39=40\n\na4=1+3*a3=1+120=121\n\na5=1+3*a4=1+363=364\n\na6=1+3*a5=1+1092=1093\n\na7=1+3*a6=1+3279=3280\n\na8=1+3*a7=1+9840=9841\n\na9=1+3*a8=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that's another way to represent it, but it's essentially the same process.\n\nI think my approach was correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and I carefully computed each multiplication and addition, double-checking where necessary.\n\nSo, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards step by step.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the very inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. That seems straightforward. So now, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nBut wait, the innermost part was the last (1+3), so actually, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(result of innermost). Let me try to map this out.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number to keep track. Let's say the innermost is layer 1, then moving outwards, layer 2, up to layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 3*(1 + result from layer 1). Hmm, maybe I should write this step by step.\n\nLet me write each step as I compute each layer:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 4). Wait, is that right? Let me check. The next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if the previous result was 4, then 1 + 3*4. Wait, no, hold on. The structure is 3*(1 + something). So, if the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\n3. Compute 3*(1 + 4) = 3*(5) = 15.\n\nWait, that seems a bit big. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from the inside:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, adding 1, multiplying by 3, and that's the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, that seems to be the pattern.\n\nLet me write down each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, the final result is 36,084. That seems pretty large, but considering each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3 each time, it might add up quickly.\n\nLet me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let's compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So, 300+120=420, 420+24=444. Correct.\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So, 1200+120=1320, 1320+15=1335. Correct.\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So, 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. Correct.\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12,000, 9*3=27. So, 12,000 + 27 = 12,027. Correct.\n\n9. Finally, 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028. Let's compute 12,028*3: 12,000*3=36,000, 28*3=84. So, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 36,084. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a smarter way to compute this without having to compute each layer manually? Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 3 each time. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). Let me denote each layer as a sequence. Let me define a recursive sequence where a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost, which is 4. Then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 15, as before. Then a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 48, and so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write this as: a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3*A - 1.5 => 3*A = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this: 11/6*3^n = (11/6)*(3^n) = (11/6)*3^n.\n\nAlternatively, 3^n can be written as 3^{n}, so a_n = (11/6)*3^{n} - 3/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - 3/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 / 6: 19683 \u00f7 6. Let's compute that.\n\n6*3280 = 19680. So, 19683 - 19680 = 3. Therefore, 19683 / 6 = 3280.5.\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11: Let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36,080 and 0.5*11=5.5. So, total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: 36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084. Which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. Therefore, the formula confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. However, having the formula is useful for understanding the pattern.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\).\n8.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of this expression. It seems like a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost part, each time I have 3 multiplied by the sum of 1 and another similar expression. So, maybe I can work my way outwards, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That seems like a good plan because working from the inside out should make each step manageable.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI can see that there are multiple layers here. Let's count them: starting from the innermost, each time I have a 1 + 3(...), and this repeats multiple times. Let me count how many times 3 is multiplied. Hmm, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next parentheses. Let me see, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next is 1 + 3*(that), and so on. So, I think there are nine layers here because each time we have a 1 + 3(...), and starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, actually, let's parse the expression more carefully. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis after that adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another ( inside that: (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost part is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the first 3, each time we have a 1 + 3(...), and each of those ... is another 1 + 3(...). So, if I start counting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nI think the expression has nine layers because each time I see a 1 + 3, and that's repeated nine times, each time nested within the previous one. Wait, let me check: the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...), so the number of 3s multiplied would be equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression:\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer adds a 3, so the number of 3s is equal to the number of layers. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, actually, I think I overcounted because each time I'm adding another layer, but the original expression starts with 3*(...), so maybe the number of layers is eight? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is part of the next layer. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression:\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so the number of 3s is 9, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds a 3. Wait, actually, let me count the number of 3s:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the first 3 is at the very beginning, then each time inside the parentheses, there's another 3. So, the number of 3s as multipliers is 9, because starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3. So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each with a 3 multiplier. So, I think there are 9 layers. Therefore, I need to compute from the innermost layer outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, to approach this, I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards, computing each value step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, since we're starting from the innermost, maybe it's better to number them from the innermost as L1, then L2 is the next layer outwards, up to L9 being the outermost.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, let's start by computing the innermost part first.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, the next layer outwards, E2, is 1 + 3*E1\n\nSo, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(E9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, after computing E9, which is 29524, the final result is 3*E9.\n\nSo, final result = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so yes, E9 is the innermost, and each layer up to E9 is built by 1 + 3*previous layer, and then the outermost is 3*(E9). So, yes, the final result is 3*E9.\n\nSo, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back and check each Ei computation step by step.\n\nStarting with E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093:\n\n1093 * 3:\n\n3*1000=3000\n\n3*90=270\n\n3*3=9\n\nSo, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279\n\nSo, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280:\n\n3*3000=9000\n\n3*280=840\n\nSo, 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\nE8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*800=2400\n\n3*40=120\n\n3*1=3\n\nAdd them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, final result is 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. I thought there were 9 layers, but when I started computing, I went up to E9, and then multiplied by 3. But let me check the original expression again to make sure I didn't miscount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside the first set of parentheses.\n\n2. Then inside that, there's another 3.\n\n3. And so on, until the innermost 3.\n\nSo, how many 3s are there? Let me count the number of 3s in the expression:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the first 3 is the outermost. Then, each time inside the parentheses, there's another 3. Let's count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3 inside that.\n3. Continuing until the innermost 3.\n\nLet me count the number of 3s as multipliers:\n\nAfter the first 3, each layer adds another 3. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds a 3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost part is 1 + 3, which is the first layer after the initial 3.\n\nThen, each time we have a 3*(...), so the number of 3s as multipliers is equal to the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each opening parenthesis represents a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(...)\n2. Then another ( inside that: (1 + 3(...)\n3. And so on.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then another ( after that.\n3. Continuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, the expression ends with a )))))))) after the innermost 1 + 3. So, how many closing parentheses are there after the innermost part? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, each layer adds another ( and ), so the number of closing parentheses after the innermost 1 + 3 would indicate how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of times this occurs is equal to the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer. Then, inside that, another 3*(1 + 3(...)), which is the second layer, and so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nSo, let's count the number of 3s that are followed by (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each subsequent 3 is part of the next layer. So, the number of 3s as multipliers is 9, because the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer, and each time we add another 3*(...). Wait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is layer 2, and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, no, the outermost is 3*(layer 9). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, each with a 3 multiplier, and then the final result is 3*(layer 9). Wait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to E9, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, we have 1 + 3*(...), which is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 8, and then the innermost is layer 9. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, with E1 being the innermost, and E9 being the outermost before the final 3 multiplier.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. Let me write down the expression with indices to see how many layers there are.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers, each defined by 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from Layer 1 = 1 + 3, up to Layer 9, and then the final result is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, in my earlier computation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that by looking at the expression again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nLayer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, yes, that's 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then the final result is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nTherefore, my earlier computation seems correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and the final result being 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing each layer again step by step, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, final result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used to compute this without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it as such.\n\nLet me denote the value of each layer as a_i, where i is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n = 1, a_1 = 4\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n = 1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn = 5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn = 6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn = 7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn = 8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn = 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as computed.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nSince 3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as (3^{11} - 3)/2, but since the problem asks to compute the given expression, the numerical value is 88572.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step, or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, we arrive at the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and both the step-by-step method and the closed-form formula give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we can compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3 to get the outermost layer:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the innermost part is $(1 + 3)$. Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have $1 + 3(\\text{result from above})$. Wait, let me make sure. The next layer is $1 + 3(1 + 3)$, but since we just computed the innermost as 4, the next one would be $1 + 3*4$.\n\nWait, maybe I should label each step to keep track. Let me number each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count them: \n\n1. Layer 1: $(1 + 3)$\n2. Layer 2: $(1 + 3(\\text{Layer 1}))$\n3. Layer 3: $(1 + 3(\\text{Layer 2}))$\n...\nUp to Layer 9: $3(\\text{Layer 8})$\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the original problem, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so each layer after the first is multiplied by 3. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, let's parse the expression correctly. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, inside the parentheses, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outward each time.\n\nSo, let me define each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a big jump. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = Let's compute that.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, the inner expression is up to Layer 8, which we computed as 9841. So, the final result is 3*9841.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\":\n\nStarting from the first parenthesis after the initial 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(\" before the innermost (1 + 3). So, that means the innermost is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, we have 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, after Layer 9, we have the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, so maybe my initial count was off. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think my initial layers were correct, with Layer 1 being the innermost (1 + 3), and Layer 9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, proceeding with that:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = Let's compute that.\n\nWait, hold on. Layer 9 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = Let me compute 9841 * 3.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nSo, Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me go through the layers again more carefully:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check each step again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093:\n\n1,000*3 = 3,000\n\n90*3 = 270\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nSo, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3*3,280:\n\n3,000*3 = 9,000\n\n280*3 = 840\n\nSo, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841:\n\n9,000*3 = 27,000\n\n800*3 = 2,400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost multiplication: 3*29,524.\n\nLet's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000*3 = 60,000\n\n9,000*3 = 27,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ), we can compute it as (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nThus, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only had 9 layers, computing step by step was manageable, though a bit time-consuming.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step carefully. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find the closed-form solution to confirm the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive kind of structure. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of problems. Let me try that.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3), right? So that's 1 plus 3, which is 4. Then, moving one step out, we have another (1+3(...)), so let's compute that. Wait, but actually, each step is 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner expression. Hmm, maybe I should define each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as E1, E2, E3, up to E9, since there are nine layers of parentheses. So starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3  \nE2 = 1 + 3 * E1  \nE3 = 1 + 3 * E2  \n... and so on, until  \nE9 = 1 + 3 * E8  \n\nAnd the final result will be 3 * E9. That makes sense because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), which is E9.\n\nSo let's compute each E step by step.\n\nStarting with E1:\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, E2:\nE2 = 1 + 3 * E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, E3:\nE3 = 1 + 3 * E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4:\nE4 = 1 + 3 * E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5:\nE5 = 1 + 3 * E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6:\nE6 = 1 + 3 * E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7:\nE7 = 1 + 3 * E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8:\nE8 = 1 + 3 * E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9:\nE9 = 1 + 3 * E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by E9, so:\n\nResult = 3 * E9 = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3  \n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3  \n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12  \n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7  \n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8  \nSo that gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify with another method. Maybe using distributive property:\n\n29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3  \n= 29000*3 + 524*3  \n= 87000 + 1572  \n= 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check each E step because it's easy to make a mistake in the earlier steps, which would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nStarting again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nAll the E steps check out. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit surprised that the number is so large, but considering each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's exponential growth. So, each layer increases the value significantly.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Maybe I can model it with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think about it. Let\u2019s define E_n as the expression starting from the nth layer. So, E_1 is the innermost, which is 4, and each subsequent E_n is 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nSo, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C  \nC - 3*C = 1  \n-2C = 1  \nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2  \n4 = 3A - 1/2  \n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for E_9, which is the outermost layer, n = 9:\n\nE_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, used a recurrence relation to model it, and even found a formula that gives the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as \\( E_n \\) where \\( E_1 \\) is the innermost part and \\( E_9 \\) is the outermost part. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nE_1 &= 1 + 3 = 4, \\\\\nE_2 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13, \\\\\nE_3 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40, \\\\\nE_4 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121, \\\\\nE_5 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364, \\\\\nE_6 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093, \\\\\nE_7 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280, \\\\\nE_8 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841, \\\\\nE_9 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[\n3 \\cdot E_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works for these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to visualize or write down each step. Let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last \"1+3\" before the first closing parenthesis. So starting there, maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me write this down step by step, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4.\n\n2. The next layer out would be 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\n3. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Continuing outward: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). That's 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\n7. Next step: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). That's 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\n8. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8). That's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let me break that down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a nested expression where each level is 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). So, it's like a chain of operations where each step depends on the one before it. Maybe I can solve it by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works for nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses. Each one starts with 1 and adds 3 multiplied by another expression. So, perhaps I can compute the innermost one first and then work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Then, moving one level out, we have 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, 3 * 4 = 12. Then, add 1 to that: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me correct that. Each level is 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, maybe I should represent each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, ..., up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot. But let me check each step carefully because I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting again, maybe I should write each step more clearly:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000, but wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, so:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, that seems really big. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, Level 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series. Each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level), which might be similar to a geometric progression.\n\nLet me think about it. If I denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let me try to find B.\n\nAssuming the steady-state solution, where a_n = a_{n-1} = B. So, B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th level is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: the problem is to compute 3*(...), where the innermost expression is (1+3). So, does that mean that the total expression has 9 levels? Let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the first level.\n\nThen, each subsequent level adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...):\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...)) is a level, and there are 9 such levels. So, the outermost is 3*(Level 9). So, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the levels. Let me write the expression again with each level:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)=1 + 39=40\n\nLevel 4:1 + 3*(Level3)=1+120=121\n\nLevel5:1 +3*(Level4)=1+363=364\n\nLevel6:1+3*(Level5)=1+1092=1093\n\nLevel7:1+3*(Level6)=1+3279=3280\n\nLevel8:1+3*(Level7)=1+9840=9841\n\nLevel9:1+3*(Level8)=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, yes, 9 levels, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, Level 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but 3^{10} is 59049, so yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, it's like a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach is to expand the entire expression.\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, as before, we have:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the previous method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, perhaps the total expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me try to represent the expression as a sum. Let's see.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 + 3 + 9 = 13 =1 + 3 + 9\n\nSimilarly, the next level: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) =1 + 3 + 9 + 27 =40\n\nWait, that seems like each level adds another power of 3.\n\nSo, at each level, the expression becomes 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but let me check.\n\nAt Level1: (1 + 3) =1 + 3=4\n\nLevel2:1 +3*(Level1)=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13\n\nLevel3:1 +3*(Level2)=1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27=40\n\nLevel4:1 +3*(Level3)=1 +3*(1 +3 +9 +27)=1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121\n\nWait a minute, this seems like each Level n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nWait, the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier.\n\nSo, Level n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Level9 is (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If each Level n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, then Level1 is sum from k=0 to1 of 3^k=1+3=4, which matches. Level2 is sum from k=0 to2 of 3^k=1+3+9=13, which also matches. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3 times the sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k, which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nWait, so another way to compute this is to recognize that the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k).\n\nWhich is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it by expanding all the terms step by step without using the formula.\n\nLet me try that approach again, just to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n(1 + 3) =4\n\nNext layer:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nNext:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nNext:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nNext:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each step using another method, just to be thorough.\n\nLet me compute each step again:\n\nLevel1: (1 +3)=4\n\nLevel2:1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13\n\nLevel3:1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40\n\nLevel4:1 +3*(40)=1 +120=121\n\nLevel5:1 +3*(121)=1 +363=364\n\nLevel6:1 +3*(364)=1 +1092=1093\n\nLevel7:1 +3*(1093)=1 +3279=3280\n\nLevel8:1 +3*(3280)=1 +9840=9841\n\nLevel9:1 +3*(9841)=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I've checked this enough times, and each time I get the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check the multiplication one more time because that's where I might have made a mistake.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nThere are no more digits, so write down 2.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this multiple times, using different approaches: step-by-step computation, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, and using the recurrence relation formula. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next level. Recognizing this as a geometric series, we find that each level follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula up to the ninth level and then multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start from the innermost part of the expression because that's usually where you begin with nested parentheses. So, the innermost part here is the last \"1+3\". Let me write that down:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another \"1 + 3(...)\" where the \"...\" is the result from the first layer. So, substituting that in, we have:\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(4). Hmm, wait, no, actually, looking back at the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1st innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let's compute that:\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so that's 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So:\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that:\n\n3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, so that's 40. Now, moving out another layer:\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40.\n\nCalculating that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, 121. That's interesting, it's a perfect square. Maybe that's a pattern? Let's see as we go on.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*121.\n\nCalculating 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nOkay, 364. Not a perfect square, but maybe it's part of a sequence.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\nLet me compute 3*364 first. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nHmm, 1093. That seems like a prime number, but maybe not important right now.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating 3*1093: Let's see, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nAlright, 3280. That's a pretty big number.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nLet me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait a second, 9841. That looks familiar. Is that a square number? Let me check. 99 squared is 9801, 100 squared is 10000. So, 99^2 = 9801, 99*99=9801. 9801 + 140 = 9941. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, 9841. Let me see, 99^2 is 9801, so 9841 - 9801 = 40. So, it's not a perfect square. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the previous step. So, 3*3280. Let me compute 3280 * 3:\n\n3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nOkay, moving on. Now, the ninth layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841 first. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nAlright, 29524. That's a big number. Let me see if that's a square. 170^2 is 28900, 180^2 is 32400. So, somewhere in between. Let me try 172^2: 170^2=28900, 2*170*2=680, 2^2=4. So, 28900 + 680 + 4 = 29584. Hmm, that's higher than 29524. So, maybe 171^2: 171*171. Let me compute that: 170*170=28900, 170*1=170, 1*170=170, 1*1=1. So, 28900 + 170 + 170 + 1 = 28900 + 340 + 1 = 29241. Hmm, that's lower than 29524. So, between 171^2 and 172^2. So, 29524 isn't a perfect square. Maybe I miscalculated?\n\nWait, no, maybe it's a different kind of number. Anyway, moving on.\n\nTenth layer: 1 + 3*29524.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me count the layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(result). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, there's a 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each next layer is 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nFrom the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a new layer, so:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nUp to 9 layers? Wait, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(...), each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)).\n\nFrom the innermost, the first is (1+3), then each step adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, one layer out is (1+3(1+3))\n- Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n- So, each time, adding another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Let's see:\n\nFrom the initial 3(...), the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3\" inside:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n- Then, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we have to compute the layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each layer out is 1+3*(previous result). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3\" expressions.\n\nLooking at the original expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, actually, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, starting from layer 1 as the innermost (1+3), up to layer 9, which is the outermost before the initial 3(...). So, that means after computing layer 9, we then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then I was about to compute the 10th layer, which is 1 + 3*(29524). But actually, the initial 3 is outside all the layers. So, the layers go up to 9, and then the final result is 3*(result of layer 9). So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, the layers are:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after layer 9, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, we need to compute 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but there's an additional constant term each time. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3*C\n\nSo, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the closed-form formula works.\n\nTherefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's a much faster way, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's good to recognize such patterns.\n\nBut since I already computed each layer step by step and arrived at the same result, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, so 3^{10}=59049. Then, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of multiplications and additions. By recognizing the pattern and using a closed-form formula, we can efficiently compute the result without manually calculating each layer. \n\nThe expression simplifies as follows:\n\n1. Identify the recurrence relation: each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n2. Derive the closed-form formula: \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n3. Compute the innermost term and apply the formula iteratively.\n4. Multiply the final result by 3.\n\nThe final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning it's a bunch of expressions inside other expressions. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by something in parentheses, and inside that, it's another 1 plus 3 times something else. It seems like a repeating pattern. Let me see how many layers there are here.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is 1+3, and then each layer wraps around with 3 times that result plus 1. So, maybe I can compute this from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That seems logical because each layer depends on the result of the previous one.\n\nLet me write this down step by step to keep track. I'll start by identifying each layer. Let's number them from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, actually, wait. Let me count the number of layers properly.\n\nLooking at the original expression: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, the innermost is 1+3, then that is inside another 1+3*(...), and so on. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\n2. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is Layer 2.\n\n3. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 1+3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2013 Layer 1\n\n2. (1+3*(Layer 1)) \u2013 Layer 2\n\n3. (1+3*(Layer 2)) \u2013 Layer 3\n\n4. (1+3*(Layer 3)) \u2013 Layer 4\n\n5. (1+3*(Layer 4)) \u2013 Layer 5\n\n6. (1+3*(Layer 5)) \u2013 Layer 6\n\n7. (1+3*(Layer 6)) \u2013 Layer 7\n\n8. (1+3*(Layer 7)) \u2013 Layer 8\n\n9. (1+3*(Layer 8)) \u2013 Layer 9\n\n10. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, so that's 10 layers? Or is it 9 layers? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one layer. Then each subsequent 1 + 3*(...) adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me see:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so that's the first layer.\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), that's the second layer, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2013 Layer 1\n\n2. (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) \u2013 Layer 2\n\n3. (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) \u2013 Layer 3\n\n4. (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) \u2013 Layer 4\n\n5. (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) \u2013 Layer 5\n\n6. (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) \u2013 Layer 6\n\n7. (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) \u2013 Layer 7\n\n8. (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) \u2013 Layer 8\n\n9. (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) \u2013 Layer 9\n\n10. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, so that's 9 layers inside the first 3*(...). So, the total layers are 9, with the outermost 3 multiplied by Layer 9.\n\nSo, I need to compute Layer 1 to Layer 9, starting from the inside, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nAlright, let's start computing each layer one by one.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify with another method. Let's break down 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which might help verify the result without computing each layer.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, that seems solid. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication, let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after verifying each step and even using a different method with the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested computation that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus three times the previous layer's result.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each one starting with 1 plus 3 times something. So, it's like a chain where each part depends on the one before it. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nHmm, okay, so the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. \n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. \n\nNow, moving one level out, the next part is 3 times that result. So, let's compute that:\n\n2. 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nThen, we add 1 to that result:\n\n3. 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, but hold on, each level seems to be 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, maybe I should represent each step as a separate computation. Let me try to break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.\n\nLet me assign each level a number from 1 to 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. \n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLevel 3: 1 + Level 2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 4: 3*(Level 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLevel 5: 1 + Level 4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 6: 3*(Level 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLevel 7: 1 + Level 6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 8: 3*(Level 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLevel 9: 1 + Level 8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 10: 3*(Level 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me check again. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to the 9th level. So, perhaps I went one step too far. Let me recount:\n\nLet me number each nested part:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(result from 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(result from 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(result from 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(result from 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(result from 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(result from 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(result from 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(result from 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*(result from 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems too high. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can express this as a recursive formula or find a pattern.\n\nLet me define each term as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each nested expression as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, starting with a_1:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations because they seem to be getting quite large, and I might have made an error in multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me go step by step again:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364:\n\n364 * 3:\n\n300*3 = 900\n\n60*3 = 180\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding up: 900 + 180 = 1080; 1080 + 12 = 1092\n\nSo, a_6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3 = 3000\n\n90*3 = 270\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding up: 3000 + 270 = 3270; 3270 + 9 = 3279\n\nSo, a_7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3 = 9000\n\n200*3 = 600\n\n80*3 = 240\n\nAdding up: 9000 + 600 = 9600; 9600 + 240 = 9840\n\nSo, a_8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, a_9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify this because sometimes when dealing with multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Maybe I can compute a few steps again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me recompute a_5 to a_9:\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this sequence. It seems like each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight-hand side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have a_9, let's compute a_9 using this formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to confirm, 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully working through each step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). By computing each level step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3*(1 + appears, which seems to be 9 times.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ... So, from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so that would make the outermost layer a_9 = 36084. But let me check if that's correct because I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the original expression, how many times does 3*(1 + appear? Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + is present.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach 3*(1 + is a new layer. Let me see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n- This continues until the innermost (1 + 3)\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers, right? Because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ... So, if I have 9 layers, then the final result is 36084.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, it's (1 + 3(...)), so the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of layers. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of ( after the initial 3: \n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so let's see:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each starting with (1+3. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, the final result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let me compute each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each time, we're taking the previous result, adding 1, multiplying by 3, and moving outward.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the nested structure, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try computing a few layers manually to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll right, each step checks out. So, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing it in a different way. Maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nThis expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n layers. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if we let a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 3\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 3 => -2*a_p = 3 => a_p = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nBut let's compute a_n for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 / 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36,080 and 0.5 * 11 = 5.5, so total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 = 1.5 from that:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches our step-by-step computation. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, and even derived a closed-form solution using recurrence relations to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 3 times (1 plus the result of the next layer).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the structure of this expression. It seems like there's a lot of nested parentheses, each containing a 1 plus 3 times something. So, it's like a chain of operations where each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, the innermost part of the expression is the last one: $1 + 3$. Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so that part is simple enough. Now, moving one step out, the next part is $1 + 3(1 + 3)$. Wait, but since we just computed that inner part as 4, this becomes $1 + 3*4$. Let me calculate that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, that part simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving outward another step, the next part is $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))$. But wait, we already calculated the inner part as 4, then the next one as 13. So, substituting those in, it becomes $1 + 3*13$. Let me compute that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that step gives me 40.\n\nHmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me see if this pattern continues. The next step out would be $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))$. But we already know the innermost part is 4, the next is 13, then 40. So, substituting, it becomes $1 + 3*40$. Calculating that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, now we're at 121.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))$. Substituting the previous result, which was 121, we get $1 + 3*121$. Let me compute that: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364.\n\nMoving outward again, the next part is $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))$. Substituting the last result, 364, this becomes $1 + 3*364$. Calculating that: 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, now we're at 1093.\n\nAnother layer out, we have $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))$. Substituting the previous 1093, this becomes $1 + 3*1093$. Let me compute that: 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, 3280 is the next result.\n\nMoving one step further out, the expression is $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))$. Substituting the last value, 3280, we get $1 + 3*3280$. Calculating that: 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, now we have 9841.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))$. Substituting 9841, this becomes $1 + 3*9841$. Let's calculate that: 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nAnother step out, the expression is $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$. Substituting the previous result, 29524, this becomes $1 + 3*29524$. Calculating that: 3 times 29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. So, now we're at 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is the entire expression given: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$. We just computed the innermost part as 88573, so substituting that in, we have 3 times 88573. Let me compute that: 3 times 88573. Hmm, let's break it down. 80,000 times 3 is 240,000. 8,000 times 3 is 24,000. 500 times 3 is 1,500. 70 times 3 is 210. 3 times 3 is 9. Adding all those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000. 264,000 + 1,500 is 265,500. 265,500 + 210 is 265,710. 265,710 + 9 is 265,719. So, 3 times 88,573 is 265,719.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88,573 times 3: 3 times 3 is 9, 3 times 7 is 21, carry over the 2. 3 times 5 is 15 plus 2 is 17, carry over the 1. 3 times 8 is 24 plus 1 is 25, carry over the 2. 3 times 8 is 24 plus 2 is 26. So, writing it out: 88,573 * 3 is 265,719. Yep, that looks correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way out, each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. We did this repeatedly until we reached the outermost layer, and then multiplied by 3 one final time. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any errors in my calculations, let me recap the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nEach step seems correct, so I think the final answer is 265,719. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the right result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost part:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested 3s and 1s. It seems like each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus something).

That should be straightforward.\n\nLet me write down each step as I go along. Maybe I can work my way outwards, simplifying each part one by one. Let's start with the innermost expression:\n\n1. Innermost part: 1 + 3. That equals 4. So, replacing that, the next layer becomes 3 times (1 + 3). Wait, but actually, each layer is 3 times (1 + something). So, let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I should number each layer to keep track. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1+3(...), that's a new layer.

Wait, let me count.\n\nWait, the problem is written as: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, it's 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on.

So, how many layers? Let's see.\n\nLet me write it out step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(...): 3*(29523) = 88569\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, I think I might have miscounted. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the first 3, there are 8 more layers of 1+3(...).

So, total layers from inner to outer: 9.\n\nWait, but when I did the calculation earlier, I ended up with 10 layers, which might be incorrect. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.

Let me clarify.\n\nEach layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index them differently. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute from the innermost outwards, step by step, keeping track of each value.\n\nLet me start by writing down each step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing up to Step 9, which is 29524, we have to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, but let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, after computing the innermost, we have 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the outermost layer is 3*(result from Step 9).\n\nSo, Step 10: Compute 3*(result from Step 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n--------\n\n3*4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n3*2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3*5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n3*9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n3*2 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88569, but that was a miscalculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in my earlier steps, I had:\n\nStep 1: 4\n\nStep 2: 13\n\nStep 3: 40\n\nStep 4: 121\n\nStep 5: 364\n\nStep 6: 1093\n\nStep 7: 3280\n\nStep 8: 9841\n\nStep 9: 29524\n\nThen, Step 10: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought the result was 88569, but that's incorrect. The correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was 88569, but that must have been a miscalculation. Let me confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from 4, each step is 3*(1 + previous).\n\nLet me try to see if there's a formula for this kind of recursive multiplication. It seems like a geometric series, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, we start with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc. Wait, that doesn't match my earlier steps. Wait, perhaps I'm misdefining the sequence.\n\nWait, no, in my earlier steps, after a_1 = 4, a_2 was 13, but according to this, a_2 should be 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. But in my earlier step-by-step, a_2 was 13. So, there's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, no, let me see. In the problem, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost layer would be 3*(36084) = 108252\n\nWait, but this is conflicting with my earlier step-by-step. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the layers. Let me clarify: Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(36084) = 108252\n\nWait, but this is different from my initial calculation. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from how the layers are structured. Let me try to parse the original expression correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )).\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen, moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on, until we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), and then the outermost is another 3*(...).\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n10. 3*(36084) = 108252\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...) after the initial 3. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 instances of 1 + 3*(...). So, that would mean 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result), so:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(36084) = 108252\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 88572, but that was based on a miscalculation. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the original expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is part of a new layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers.\n\nEach time after the first 3, there are 8 more layers. Wait, no, let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, from the innermost, how many layers do we have?\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(36084) = 108252\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), where the ... has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, that would mean 9 layers inside the first 3*(...), so total layers would be 10? Or is it 9?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute it step by step, carefully, to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 9 layers leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But now, using this method, I'm getting 108252. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how the layers are being counted. Let me try to parse the original expression again, perhaps using parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...)\n- Inside that, it's 3*(1 + ...)\n- And so on, until we have 9 instances of 1 + 3*(...)\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, each time adding a new 3*(1 + ...).\n\nThus, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(36084) = 108252\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, does that mean that the outermost is another 3*(...), making it 10 layers? Or is the outermost 3 included in the count?\n\nWait, the original expression starts with 3*(...), so the first 3 is part of the outermost layer. Then, inside that, we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, total layers would be 10? Or is it 9?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute it step by step, carefully, to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me write down each layer, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\n10. Next layer: 3*(36084) = 108252\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers inside the first 3*(...). So, perhaps the correct answer is 108252.\n\nBut earlier, I had a different result when I thought there were 9 layers leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one.\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n3(1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another 3, etc.\n\nSo, the number of 3s after the first one is 8, because each time we have another 3*(1 + ...). So, total layers after the first 3 are 8, meaning that the innermost is 1 + 3, then 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), and then the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, that would mean:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(12027) = 36081\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with my earlier counts. I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me try to compute the value step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nStep 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nStep 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nStep 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nStep 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nStep 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nStep 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nStep 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*(...), where ... is the result from Step 9, which is 36084.\n\nSo, Step 10: 3*36084 = 108252\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 108252.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88572, but that must have been a miscalculation. So, the correct answer should be 108252.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table of each step:\n\nLayer | Value\n1 | 4\n2 | 15\n3 | 48\n4 | 147\n5 | 444\n6 | 1335\n7 | 4008\n8 | 12027\n9 | 36084\n10 | 108252\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's value). So, starting from 4, each step multiplies by 3 and adds 3, but structured as 3*(1 + previous).\n\nTherefore, the final result is 108252.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By carefully evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the final result is 108,252.\n\n$\\boxed{108252}$"
