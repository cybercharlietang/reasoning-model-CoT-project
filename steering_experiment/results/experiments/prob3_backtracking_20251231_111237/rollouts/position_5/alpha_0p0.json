    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive kind of structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times the next parenthesis. Hmm, so maybe each step is similar, and I can compute each one step by step.\n\nLet me start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, let's compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\n1. Innermost: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another 3 multiplied by that result. Wait, let me check. The next layer is 3 times (1 + 3(...)). But actually, no, each layer is 3 times (1 + next layer). So, after computing the innermost, I need to plug it into the next one.\n\nWait, maybe I should number each layer to keep track. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd this goes on until Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3. Let me make sure.\n\nLooking again, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3*(...). The innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, nine layers. So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 1+3's. So, I think it's correct that there are nine layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(next layer), and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500.\n\nThen, 24 * 3 = 72.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the total of 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each time, I'm computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous. So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nI notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nEach time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but with each term also adding 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, since it's nested, it's more like a sum of terms where each term is 3^n, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, let me try to write the expression in terms of a sum.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine 1+3's.\n\nWait, but each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), so perhaps we can write E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(...)) = 3 + 9*(next layer).\n\nBut this seems similar to the previous approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as E = 3*(1 + E'), where E' is the inner expression.\n\nBut in this case, E' would have eight layers, so it's similar to the recursive approach.\n\nBut since I've already solved it using the iterative method and the formula, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Start with the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n- Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\n- After nine layers, the result is 29,524.\n\n- Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors, as I double-checked each step, and the formula using the recurrence relation also gave the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression simplifies step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach, we determine that each layer follows a specific pattern, leading to the final result after all layers are computed and multiplied by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\), and the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\), which is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, no, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3 times something. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(the previous result). So, let me list each layer step by step.\n\nLet's define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are nine layers of parentheses. Each L is 1 + 3*(previous L). Wait, actually, the innermost is L1, then L2, etc., up to L9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9).\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8), and so on. So, let me compute each L step by step.\n\nLet me start by numbering the layers from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 3*20000 = 60000.\n\n3*9524 = 3*(9000 + 524) = 27000 + 1572 = 28572.\n\nSo, adding 60000 + 28572 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 3*29524 is actually 88572, right? Let me double-check that multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1.\n\nNo, wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me think again. Is there a pattern here that could have been recognized earlier to save computation time? Because computing each layer step by step is a bit tedious, but perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's take the innermost expression: (1+3)=4. Then, 3*4=12. That's correct.\n\nIf I take two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))=3*(1+3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39.\n\nUsing the formula: n=2, L_2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Then, 3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120.\n\nUsing the formula: n=3, L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Then, 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for n=9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Define \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\).\n3. **Closed-form Solution**: Solve the recurrence to get \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n4. **Compute for n=9**: \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like there's a repeating pattern here, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually makes sense with nested expressions because you want to handle the deepest level first before moving to the outer ones.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, let's count how many times the pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost part, which is just 1+3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times (1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. I think there are nine sets of parentheses here, so maybe this pattern repeats nine times? Wait, no, actually, looking at it, each layer adds one more 3. Let me count the number of 3s multiplied by the parentheses.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to start from the innermost part and work my way out. So, let's start evaluating from the innermost parentheses and move outward step by step. That should make it manageable.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the inside out for clarity. So, starting with the innermost one:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, step 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times the result of the innermost parentheses. So, step 2: Compute 3 * (result from step 1).\n\nSo, 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nNow, moving out another level, the next expression is (1 + result from step 2). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 3: Compute (1 + 12) = 13.\n\nThen, moving out another level, it's 3 times the result from step 3.\n\nStep 4: 3 * 13 = 39.\n\nNext, moving out another level, we have (1 + result from step 4).\n\nStep 5: (1 + 39) = 40.\n\nThen, moving out another level, it's 3 times that result.\n\nStep 6: 3 * 40 = 120.\n\nContinuing outward, next is (1 + result from step 6).\n\nStep 7: (1 + 120) = 121.\n\nThen, moving out, multiply by 3.\n\nStep 8: 3 * 121 = 363.\n\nNext, add 1.\n\nStep 9: (1 + 363) = 364.\n\nMultiply by 3.\n\nStep 10: 3 * 364 = 1092.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have miscounted the steps because each time I go out a level, I'm adding a new step. Let me check how many levels I actually have. The original expression has multiple layers, so perhaps I need to ensure I'm not missing any steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each step with its corresponding parentheses. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let me parse the expression more accurately.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each level as level 1, level 2, ..., level 9.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + Level 2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(Level 3) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + Level 4 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(Level 5) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + Level 6 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(Level 7) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + Level 8 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*(Level 9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but that seems like 9 levels, but when I count the number of 3s, I think there are 9 layers. Let me confirm by counting the number of times 3(1+3(...) occurs. From the original expression, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer, so yes, 9 layers.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier step-by-step, I had 9 levels, but let me recount to make sure I didn't miss any steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write each step as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but perhaps I miscounted the levels because the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ... terms. Starting from the innermost, each time you go out, you add another 3*(1 + ... So, how many times does that happen?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(... in the expression. Starting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, each time you go out a layer, you have another 3*(1 + ... So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds a new 3*(... So, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we have 3*(1 + ... So, the innermost is just (1 + 3) = 4, then moving out, each time you have 3*(previous result) +1? Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps it's a recursive structure.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, that might be a better way to approach it. So, let's model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute each a_n step by step.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000.\n\n3*9000 = 27000.\n\n3*500 = 1500.\n\n3*24 = 72.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because earlier steps were giving me 1092, but this approach is giving me a much larger number. So, I must have made a mistake in how I'm modeling the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of terms. Let me go back to the original expression and count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...) terms.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(previous result) +1? Wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but the way I defined a_n earlier may have been incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, that seems different from the earlier approach where I had a_9 = 29524. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think the confusion arises from how I'm defining the sequence. In the first approach, I was defining a_n as each layer starting from the innermost, but perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let's try again, more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNow, the outermost multiplication is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364.\n\nCompute 3*364:\n\n3*300 = 900.\n\n3*60 = 180.\n\n3*4 = 12.\n\nAdding up: 900 + 180 = 1080; 1080 + 12 = 1092.\n\nSo, the final result is 1092.\n\nWait, that makes sense, and each step seems to check out. So, perhaps my earlier approach where I defined a_1 to a_9 was incorrect because I was adding an extra layer beyond what's in the original expression.\n\nWait, let me check again by another method. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, the expression inside is a repeated pattern of 1 + 3*(...), which can be modeled as a geometric series. Let me try to find a general formula for such a nested expression.\n\nSuppose we have a nested expression of the form:\n\na = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\nIf there are n layers, then a can be expressed recursively as a = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the number of layers is 9, as per the original expression. So, perhaps the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is a_9, which we computed as 364, leading to the final result of 1092.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I have a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4, then we can write this as a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got a_9 as 364, which led to the final result of 1092. But according to this formula, a_9 is 29524, which would make the final result 3*29524 = 88572, which is much larger than 1092. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in either the formula or the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, let me check where the confusion is. In the original expression, the number of layers is 9, but perhaps the way I'm indexing the layers in the formula is different. Let me see.\n\nIn the original expression, the innermost layer is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on up to a_9.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, which matches.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 121, which matches.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 364, which matches.\n\nWait, so when n=5, a_5=364, which is what I computed earlier as Layer 9.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, but in my step-by-step computation, I only went up to a_9=364, which is actually a_5 in the formula. So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + ... terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12.\n\n2. 3*(1 + 12)=3*13=39.\n\n3. 3*(1 + 39)=3*40=120.\n\n4. 3*(1 + 120)=3*121=363.\n\n5. 3*(1 + 363)=3*364=1092.\n\nWait, no, that's not right because the original expression has more layers. Let me try to count the number of times the pattern repeats.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the expression with indices:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nSo, according to this, the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3, ending with Layer 9 being 364, and then the final result is 3*364 = 1092.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, if Layer 9 corresponds to a_9, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which would mean the final result is 3*29524 = 88572, which contradicts the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me see. The formula gives a_n as the value after n layers, but in the original expression, the number of layers is 9, but the way the formula is set up, each a_n represents a complete layer, starting from the innermost. So, perhaps in the original expression, the number of layers is 9, meaning n=9, so a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and the final result is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step approach earlier, I only reached 364 at Layer 9, which would be a_5 according to the formula. So, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + ... terms.\n\nStarting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(... and moving inward, each time there's another 3*(1 + ... until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, let's count the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...:\n\n1. The first 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n2. Then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does 3*(1 + 3*(... occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(1 + ... Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3*(1 + 3*(, there are 8 more opening parentheses before reaching the innermost (1 + 3). So, including the first one, that's 9 layers.\n\nWait, so that means n=9 in the formula, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step approach earlier, I only got to 364 at Layer 9, which would be a_5 in the formula. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers when I was stepping through.\n\nWait, let's try stepping through again, more carefully, and see where I went wrong.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 should be 29524, but here, Layer 9 is 364. So, perhaps the formula is for a different structure. Alternatively, maybe I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 is for an expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), without the outermost multiplication by 3. So, in the original problem, we have an additional multiplication by 3 outside of the nested expression, so the total expression is 3*(nested expression), where the nested expression has 9 layers.\n\nWait, so if the nested expression is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then the total result is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step approach, I only got to 1092, which suggests that perhaps the number of layers is actually 5, not 9. But that can't be because the expression clearly has 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to count the number of times I have to multiply by 3 and add 1 in the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. 3*4 = 12.\n\n3. 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n4. 3*13 = 39.\n\n5. 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n6. 3*40 = 120.\n\n7. 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n8. 3*121 = 363.\n\n9. 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n10. 3*364 = 1092.\n\nSo, that's 10 steps, but the formula suggests that with 9 layers, the result should be much larger. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.\n\nThe formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 is derived from the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, if n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nn=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nn=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nn=4: a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nn=5: a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nn=6: a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nn=7: a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nn=8: a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nn=9: a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, according to the formula, a_9 is 29524, which is the value of the innermost expression after 9 layers. But in my step-by-step approach, I only reached 364 at step 9, which is a_5 according to the formula.\n\nWait, so perhaps the confusion is that in the original expression, the number of layers is 9, but in the formula, a_n represents the value after n layers, starting from the innermost. So, in the original expression, the innermost is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), so after 9 layers, the innermost expression would be a_9 = 29524, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step approach, I thought that the innermost is layer 1, and after 9 layers, I reach 364, which is a_5 in the formula. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression has 9 layers, meaning that the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, so the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is a_9 = 29524, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step approach, I only reached a_5 = 364, which suggests that I might have stopped too early.\n\nWait, let me try stepping through all 9 layers again, carefully.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNow, the outermost multiplication is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 should be 29524, but here, Layer 9 is 364, which is a_5 in the formula. So, perhaps the formula counts the layers differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is for a different structure, where each layer is 1 + 3*(...), without the initial 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me check: If I have an expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), then the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 would apply, where n is the number of layers. But in our problem, the entire expression is multiplied by 3, so it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))).\n\nSo, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted for that initial multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me try to model the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let's denote the entire expression as E.\n\nSo, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me denote the inner expression as F = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nThen, E = 3*F.\n\nBut F itself is similar to E but without the initial multiplication by 3. So, perhaps F = 1 + 3*F', where F' is another similar expression.\n\nWait, but this seems to be getting more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express E in terms of itself.\n\nWait, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut the inner part after the first 3*(1 + is similar to E divided by 3, because E = 3*(inner part).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me denote the inner expression as G = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nThen, E = 3*G.\n\nBut G itself is 1 + 3*G', where G' is the next inner expression.\n\nWait, but this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can set up an equation where E = 3*(1 + (E/3)), but that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, let me think again. If E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), then the part inside the first 3*( is 1 + 3*(... ), which is similar to E but without the initial 3. So, let me denote that as F = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... )).\n\nThen, E = 3*F.\n\nBut F = 1 + 3*F', where F' is the next inner expression, which is similar to F but one layer deeper.\n\nWait, but this seems to be leading me into an infinite loop. Perhaps a better approach is to recognize that each layer alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1, except for the outermost layer which only multiplies by 3.\n\nWait, in the original expression, after the innermost (1 + 3), each layer alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1, except the outermost layer which is only a multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of multiplications by 3 is one more than the number of additions of 1.\n\nWait, in my step-by-step approach, I had 9 layers, ending with 364, then multiplied by 3 to get 1092. But according to the formula, if I have 9 layers, the result should be much larger. So, perhaps my step-by-step approach is incorrect, and I need to adjust the way I'm counting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each time I go out a layer, I'm adding another 3*(1 + ...), which effectively adds a new term to the series. So, for 9 layers, the formula would give a much larger number, as in 29524, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nBut then why in my step-by-step approach, I only got to 364 at Layer 9? It seems like I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try computing a few layers using both methods to see where the discrepancy is.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 13.\n\na_3 = 40.\n\na_4 = 121.\n\na_5 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 29524.\n\nSo, after 9"

That usually works with parentheses, right? Start with the innermost part and work my way outward. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from above). So, replacing the innermost part with 4, the next layer becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now that layer simplifies to 13. Let me move one layer out. The next part is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so that becomes 40. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nAlright, so that's 121. Continuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Let me calculate that.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWhoa, that's getting big. Let me keep going. The next part is 1 + 3*(364). Calculating that.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, okay, this is increasing rapidly. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nThat's a hefty number. Moving outward again, we have 1 + 3*(3280). Let me figure that out.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWow, this is really growing. Next layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nAlright, moving outward once more, we have 1 + 3*(29524). Let me calculate that.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nAnd finally, the outermost layer is 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88,573 times 3: 3*80,000 is 240,000, 3*8,000 is 24,000, 3*500 is 1,500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each time substituting the result into the next layer, I ended up with 265,719 as the final result.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer is essentially tripling the previous result and adding 1, which leads to exponential growth. It's similar to how compound interest works, where each layer compounds the previous amount. So, yeah, the numbers get big quickly, but by breaking it down step by step, I can manage each part without getting overwhelmed.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way, let me recap each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nEach step seems correct, so I think my final answer is right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the inside out.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like a nested structure, so maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, so the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So the next layer is 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\n2. 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen, we add 1 to that result. So the next step is 1 + 12.\n\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNow, moving another layer out, we multiply this by 3 again:\n\n4. 3*(13) = 39\n\nAdding 1 to that gives:\n\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n6. 3*(40) = 120\n\nAdd 1:\n\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n8. 3*(121) = 363\n\nAdd 1:\n\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n10. 3*(364) = 1092\n\nAdd 1:\n\n11. 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n12. 3*(1093) = 3279\n\nAdd 1:\n\n13. 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n14. 3*(3280) = 9840\n\nAdd 1:\n\n15. 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n16. 3*(9841) = 29523\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check how many layers I actually have here because I might have miscounted. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is one more step. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each time we go out, it's another set. So, how many times do we have this 1 + 3*(...) structure? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine 3s after the first one. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Each one corresponds to a layer. So, we have 9 layers inside the first 3. Therefore, I need to compute 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me structure this properly.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is computed as 1 + 3*(previous term). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's our first term.\n\nLet me define:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3*(a\u2089). Because the outermost layer is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested expression. So after computing a\u2089, which is 29524, the final step is to multiply by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So adding them together, 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing step by step, I ended up with 29523 as the last multiplication, but now I see that I need to go one step further. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3s inside the parentheses: starting from the innermost, each layer has a 3, so how many 3s are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2013 that's the first 3.\n\nThen, moving out, each parenthesis has another 3, so total number of 3s is 9. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, after computing a\u2089 = 29524, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to 3*(9841) = 29523, but that was only 8 layers. So, perhaps I need to compute one more layer. Let me recount:\n\n1. a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed step by step earlier, I had:\n\nAfter step 16: 3*(9841) = 29523, but that was the 9th layer? Wait, maybe I confused the layers. Let me try to map my initial step-by-step to the a\u2081 to a\u2089.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n\n2. 3*4=12\n\n3. 1+12=13\n\n4. 3*13=39\n\n5. 1+39=40\n\n6. 3*40=120\n\n7. 1+120=121\n\n8. 3*121=363\n\n9. 1+363=364\n\n10. 3*364=1092\n\n11. 1+1092=1093\n\n12. 3*1093=3279\n\n13. 1+3279=3280\n\n14. 3*3280=9840\n\n15. 1+9840=9841\n\n16. 3*9841=29523\n\nWait, so up to step 16, I have 29523, which is 3*9841, which would correspond to a\u2089. But according to the a\u2081 to a\u2089, a\u2089 should be 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, in my step-by-step, after step 15, I have 9841, which is a\u2088, then step 16 is 3*a\u2088 = 29523, but that's not a\u2089 yet because a\u2089 is 1 + 3*a\u2088. So, I think I missed the last step.\n\nWait, so in my initial step-by-step, I stopped at 3*a\u2088, which is 29523, but I should have continued to compute a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, and then the final result is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by stopping one step too early. Therefore, the correct final result should be 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this again to make sure I didn't make a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me recast the problem as a recursive sequence:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me do it properly:\n\nWait, actually, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute a\u2089 again step by step:\n\na\u2081 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*a\u2089 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it without expanding each step, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), expanding step by step is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to double-check, let me compute 3^{10} again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both expanding step by step and using a recurrence relation formula to arrive at the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive kind of structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nSo now, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$\n\nWait, let me check that. The innermost part is the last (1 + 3), which is the ninth one. So, replacing that with 4, the next layer out is (1 + 3*4). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So when I replace the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, the next layer becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me make sure I'm doing that correctly.\n\nYes, so each time, after computing the innermost parentheses, I replace it with its value and then compute the next layer. So let me go step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 9)) = (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times all of that, right? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nYes, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So after computing the innermost layers up to Layer 1, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 3 * 29524. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n24 * 3 = 72, write down 2, carry over 7.\n\n52 * 3 = 156 + 7 = 163, write down 3, carry over 16.\n\n95 * 3 = 285 + 16 = 301, write down 1, carry over 30.\n\n29 * 3 = 87 + 30 = 117, write down 17, carry over 11.\n\nThere are no more digits, so write down 11.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should do it more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 3*29524=88572. But let me check if I did the layers correctly.\n\nWait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting with Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of (1 + 3(...)), so each layer is from 1 to 9. So when I computed Layer 9 as 4, that's correct. Then each subsequent layer up to Layer 1. Then the outermost 3*(Layer 1). So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_9, then a_8, etc., up to a_1, which is the outermost parentheses. So maybe we can model this as a recurrence.\n\nThe general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the innermost layer is a_9 = 4, then a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*4 =13, which matches what I did earlier.\n\nSo the sequence is a_9=4, a_8=13, a_7=40, a_6=121, a_5=364, a_4=1093, a_3=3280, a_2=9841, a_1=29524.\n\nSo yes, then the total expression is 3*a_1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be found. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - k*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*k^n.\n\nThen, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = k*A + c\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - k*A = c => A*(1 - k) = c => A = c/(1 - k)\n\nIn our case, k=3 and c=1, so A = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to a_1=4. Wait, but in our case, a_9=4 is the innermost. So maybe I need to adjust the indexing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to define the sequence starting from n=0. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a_9=4, a_8=13, etc., up to a_1=29524, maybe it's better to model it as starting from n=9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead consider that each a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a_1=4. Then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost is a_9=4, then a_8=13, etc., so maybe the total number of layers is 9, starting from a_9=4 up to a_1=29524.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula can be applied as follows:\n\nThe nth term of the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^n -1)/2, then for n=1, a_1=(3 -1)/2=1, but in our case, a_1=4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + something. Let me check.\n\nWait, let's solve the recurrence properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's take n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is a_9=4, which corresponds to n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step calculation, a_9=4, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^10 = 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Wait, that's a_9=29524? Wait, no, that can't be right because earlier, a_9 was the innermost layer, which was 4. Wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the indices. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3) =4, which is a_9=4. Then a_8=1 +3*a_9=13, etc., up to a_1=29524.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which matches our earlier result where a_1=29524. Wait, that seems contradictory because in the problem, a_9=4, but according to the formula, a_9=29524.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices. Maybe in the formula, n=9 corresponds to the outermost layer, not the innermost. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, let's think again. In the problem, we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost as layer 9: (1 +3)=4.\n\nThen layer 8: 1 +3*4=13.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*13=40.\n\n...\n\nUp to layer 1:1 +3*(previous layer)=29524.\n\nSo in the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n=9 corresponds to layer 9=4.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which is not 4. So that suggests that my indexing is off.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts from the outermost layer as n=1. So in the problem, the outermost layer is layer 1:1 +3*(layer 2)=29524.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=4, which is layer 9 in our problem.\n\nSo perhaps the formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is layer 9 in our problem.\n\nSo, in our problem, layer 9 corresponds to n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=4.\n\nLayer 8 corresponds to n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=13.\n\nLayer 7: n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to layer 1: n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So in our problem, the outermost layer is n=9, which gives a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_1, but wait no, the expression is 3*(layer 1), where layer 1 is a_9=29524.\n\nWait, no, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost is layer 9:4, then layer 8:13, up to layer 1:29524.\n\nSo the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo that's consistent with both the step-by-step calculation and the formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo writing it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that also works.\n\nSo, after carefully stepping through each layer, verifying each calculation, and cross-checking with the recurrence relation formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the inner layer)}\\). After computing each layer step by step, the final result of the innermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the overall result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive kind of problem, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outwards, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, if I start from the inside, I can compute each layer one by one. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from above). So, plugging in the 4 we just got:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving another layer out:\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me keep going:\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The first layer after the initial 3 is (1+3(...))\n2. Then another layer inside that: (1+3(...))\n3. Continuing, I think there are nine layers in total because each \"1+3\" is nested inside another set of parentheses, and I can see nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count them:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nFrom the end, each \")))\" is a closing parenthesis. Let me count them:\n\n- The innermost part is (1+3), so that's one closing parenthesis at the end.\n- Then, moving out, each additional closing parenthesis adds a layer. Let's see: the expression ends with nine closing parentheses. So, that means there are nine layers inside the initial 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the initial 3 is outside all the parentheses, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer.

So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, I have nine layers to compute. So, I need to compute from the ninth layer up to the first layer.\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I only went up to eight layers. Maybe I need to go one more step. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\n2. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. Layer 1: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the initial expression is 3 multiplied by this entire result. So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to the outermost, the entire expression is 3*(result). So, the final step would be multiplying 29524 by 3.\n\nWait, hold on, let me clarify. When I computed up to Layer 1, I got 29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that value.\n\nSo, the final computation would be:\n\nFinal result = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the layers correctly because I'm a bit confused about how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\" until we have nine layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 1, that was the outermost parentheses, which is the ninth layer. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, 3*(Layer 1 result) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, when I was computing Layer 1, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the layers step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me list each layer with their corresponding number:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nWait, so there are nine \"3(\" after the initial 3, meaning nine layers. So, each layer is computed as above, leading to Layer 1 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the final result.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outer expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\). After computing all layers, we multiply the final result by 3.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 9):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 1:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive structure, where each layer is similar to the one inside it. Maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works for nested expressions. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better. It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (... and so on, until the innermost part is just 1 + 3. So, I think the key is to start from the inside and compute each layer one by one. \n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer wraps another 3*(...) around it. Let's count: 1+3 is the first, then each time we add another layer. Let me see, the expression as given has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 3. So, actually, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, maybe there are eight layers? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then 3*(1+3), then 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)), and so on. Let me count the number of 1+3 inside. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time another 1+3 inside. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Continuing this way, up to the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3. Then layer 2: 3*(1 + layer1). Layer3: 3*(1 + layer2), and so on, until the outermost layer, which is layer8: 3*(1 + layer7). Wait, so how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the initial 3, there are eight sets of parentheses. Let me count the opening parentheses: after the first 3, there are eight opening parentheses, each followed by a 1 + 3(...). So, that suggests that there are eight layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer1: 1+3, then layer2: 3*(1 + layer1), layer3: 3*(1 + layer2), up to layer8: 3*(1 + layer7). So, the total expression is layer8.\n\nTherefore, I can compute this by starting from layer1 and computing each layer up to layer8. That seems manageable. Let me write down each layer and compute step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nWait, so is the final answer 12027? Let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let me compute 3*148: 140*3=420, 8*3=24, so 420+24=444. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So, 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So, 3000+900=3900, +90=3990, +18=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So, 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer builds on the previous one, and after computing each step, I end up with 12027 as the final result. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works, just to verify. \n\nEach layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4 (from 1 + 3). Then, a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, this is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 3.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to write it as:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - 3/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 3/2 = (297/2) - 3/2 = 294/2 = 147. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (11/6)*243 - 3/2 = (2673/6) - 3/2 = (891/2) - 3/2 = 888/2 = 444. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (11/6)*729 - 3/2 = (8019/6) - 3/2 = (2673/2) - 3/2 = 2670/2 = 1335. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (11/6)*2187 - 3/2 = (24057/6) - 3/2 = (8019/2) - 3/2 = 8016/2 = 4008. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (11/6)*6561 - 3/2 = (72171/6) - 3/2 = (24057/2) - 3/2 = 24054/2 = 12027. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for each layer up to n=8, which gives us the final result of 12027.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a closed-form formula, we could directly compute a_8 without computing each layer step by step. But since the problem is only eight layers deep, it's manageable to compute each layer manually, as I did earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 3. So, starting from 4, each subsequent term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, actually, that's the same as the recurrence relation we had before.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to expand the entire expression. Let me try that, just to see if it aligns with the step-by-step computation.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nLet me denote the innermost as A: A = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: B = 1 + 3*A = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, but earlier, I computed Layer2 as 15. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If A is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + A). So, let's be precise.\n\nLet me define each layer properly.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as layer1 to layer8.\n\nlayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nlayer2: 3*(1 + layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nlayer3: 3*(1 + layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nlayer4: 3*(1 + layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nlayer5: 3*(1 + layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nlayer6: 3*(1 + layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nlayer7: 3*(1 + layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nlayer8: 3*(1 + layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to expand the entire expression, it's going to be a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nEach time we have 3*(1 + ...), which is similar to 3 + 3*next layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but let me think.\n\nWait, when I expand the entire expression, starting from the innermost:\n\nStarting with the innermost: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out: 3*(1 + (1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 1 + 3) = 3*(5) = 15.\n\nThen, moving out another layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nWait, but if I expand all the way, how would that look?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum.\n\nLet me try to represent the expression E as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nWith eight layers.\n\nSo, each time, we have E = 3*(1 + E'), where E' is the next inner expression.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, let me try to write out the entire expansion.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me expand each layer:\n\nFirst, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the step-by-step approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression, it's a sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=8, but I need to check.\n\nWait, let me think about the expansion.\n\nEach time, we have 3*(1 + ...), which can be written as 3 + 3*next layer.\n\nSo, the entire expression can be written as 3 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nWhich is 3 + 3*(next layer).\n\nSo, if I keep expanding, I can write it as 3 + 3*(3 + 3*(3 + ...)).\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 + 3*(3 + 3*(...)).\n\nThis seems like a geometric series where each term is 3*3^{n}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as E = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*(3 + ...)).\n\nBut in our case, the expression is finite, with eight layers. So, it's not an infinite series, but a finite sum.\n\nWait, but in our case, the expression is finite, so it's a finite sum of terms, each multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me try to see if I can express E as a sum.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + E'), where E' is the inner expression.\n\nSo, E = 3*(1 + E') = 3 + 3*E'.\n\nSimilarly, E' = 3*(1 + E'') = 3 + 3*E''.\n\nSo, substituting back, E = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*E'') = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*E''.\n\nContinuing this way, each substitution adds another term.\n\nAfter expanding all layers, we'd have E = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^8.\n\nWait, let me see: since there are eight layers, starting from 3^1 up to 3^8.\n\nBut wait, in our case, each layer adds a multiplication by 3, but also adds 3 each time.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, each time we have 3*(1 + ...), which is 3 + 3*inner.\n\nSo, each substitution adds a 3 and then a 3 times the next inner expression.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3 + 3*E1 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15.\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3 + 3*E2 = 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48.\n\nE4 = 3 + 3*E3 = 3 + 144 = 147.\n\nWait, 3*E3 is 3*48=144, plus 3 is 147.\n\nSimilarly, E5 = 3 + 3*E4 = 3 + 441 = 444.\n\nE6 = 3 + 3*E5 = 3 + 1332 = 1335.\n\nE7 = 3 + 3*E6 = 3 + 3996 = 4008.\n\nE8 = 3 + 3*E7 = 3 + 12024 = 12027.\n\nSo, each En = 3 + 3*E(n-1).\n\nSo, if I try to expand E8, it's 3 + 3*E7.\n\nBut E7 is 3 + 3*E6, so E8 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*E6) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*E6.\n\nContinuing this way, E8 = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^8.\n\nWait, but how many terms are there? Let's see.\n\nEach substitution adds another power of 3. Since we have eight layers, starting from E1 to E8, each substitution adds one more term.\n\nSo, E8 would be 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nE1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nE2 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15 = 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3? Wait, 3 + 9 + 27=39, which is not 15.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, E1 = 4 = 1 + 3.\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression can be represented as E = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2, where n is the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me test that.\n\nIf n=1, E1=4. Plugging into formula: (3^{2} - 3)/2 = (9 -3)/2=6/2=3. Not 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps another formula.\n\nWait, in the recurrence relation, we had a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a1=4.\n\nWe found the closed-form solution as a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nLet me test for n=8:\n\na8 = (11/6)*6561 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 6561 / 6 = 1093.5.\n\n11 * 1093.5 = Let's compute 10 * 1093.5 = 10935, plus 1 * 1093.5 = 1093.5, total 10935 + 1093.5 = 12028.5.\n\nThen subtract 3/2: 12028.5 - 1.5 = 12027. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nEach a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nWe can write this as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), choosing c such that the recurrence becomes homogeneous.\n\nSo, a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c.\n\nComparing with a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, we have 3c = 3 => c=1.\n\nTherefore, a_n +1 = 3*(a_{n-1} +1).\n\nThis is a homogeneous recurrence relation with solution:\n\na_n +1 = 3^{n}*(a1 +1).\n\nGiven that a1=4, a1 +1=5.\n\nTherefore, a_n +1 = 5*3^{n}.\n\nThus, a_n = 5*3^{n} -1.\n\nWait, let me check this.\n\nFor n=1: a1=5*3 -1=15-1=14. But a1 is 4. So, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, if a_n +1 = 3*(a_{n-1} +1), then the solution is a_n +1 = (a1 +1)*3^{n-1}.\n\nGiven that a1=4, so a1 +1=5.\n\nTherefore, a_n +1 = 5*3^{n-1}.\n\nThus, a_n =5*3^{n-1} -1.\n\nLet me test for n=1: 5*3^{0} -1=5*1 -1=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:5*3^{1}-1=15-1=14. But earlier, a2=15. Wait, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, earlier, a2=15, but according to this formula, a2=14. That's a problem.\n\nWait, let me check the recurrence.\n\nWe have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nWe set b_n = a_n + c.\n\nThen, b_n = a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 + c.\n\nWe want b_n = 3*b_{n-1}.\n\nSo, 3*b_{n-1} = 3*(a_{n-1} + c) = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c.\n\nSet equal to b_n: 3*a_{n-1} + 3c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 + c.\n\nTherefore, 3c = 3 + c => 2c=3 => c=3/2.\n\nTherefore, b_n = a_n + 3/2.\n\nThen, the recurrence is b_n = 3*b_{n-1}.\n\nWith b1 = a1 + 3/2 =4 + 1.5=5.5=11/2.\n\nTherefore, b_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nThus, a_n = b_n - 3/2 = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2.\n\nWhich is the same as a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nWhich is the same as the closed-form we derived earlier: a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nBecause 11*3^{n-1} = 11/3*3^n, so (11/3*3^n - 3)/2 = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=8, a8 = (11*3^{7} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^7=2187.\n\nSo, 11*2187=24057.\n\nThen, 24057 -3=24054.\n\nDivide by 2:24054/2=12027.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo, that's another way to arrive at the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but with coefficients.\n\nWait, from the expansion:\n\nE8 = 3 + 3*E7 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*E6) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*E6.\n\nContinuing this, E8 = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to eight terms.\n\nWait, but each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but the number of terms is equal to the number of layers.\n\nWait, no, actually, each substitution adds another term, so for n layers, we have n terms.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nIf n=1: E1=4=1+3=3^0 +3^1.\n\nn=2:E2=15=3 + 3*4=3 +12=15.\n\nBut 3 + 3*4=3 +12=15, which is 3^1 +3^2.\n\nWait, 3^1 +3^2=3+9=12\u226015.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, in the expansion, E8=3 +3*E7.\n\nBut E7=3 +3*E6.\n\nSo, E8=3 +3*(3 +3*E6)=3 +9 +9*E6.\n\nSimilarly, E6=3 +3*E5, so E8=3 +9 +9*(3 +3*E5)=3 +9 +27 +27*E5.\n\nContinuing this way, each substitution adds another term multiplied by 3^{k}.\n\nSo, after expanding all layers, E8=3 + 3^2 +3^3 +3^4 +3^5 +3^6 +3^7 +3^8.\n\nWait, let's compute that sum.\n\nSum =3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +729 +2187 +6561.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 3 +9=12.\n\n12 +27=39.\n\n39 +81=120.\n\n120 +243=363.\n\n363 +729=1092.\n\n1092 +2187=3279.\n\n3279 +6561=9840.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier computation, E8=12027.\n\nBut this sum is 9840, which is less than 12027.\n\nSo, that approach must be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, each time we expand E8, we have E8=3 +3*E7.\n\nBut E7=3 +3*E6.\n\nSo, E8=3 +3*(3 +3*E6)=3 +9 +9*E6.\n\nSimilarly, E6=3 +3*E5, so E8=3 +9 +9*(3 +3*E5)=3 +9 +27 +27*E5.\n\nContinuing, E5=3 +3*E4, so E8=3 +9 +27 +27*(3 +3*E4)=3 +9 +27 +81 +81*E4.\n\nSimilarly, E4=3 +3*E3, so E8=3 +9 +27 +81 +81*(3 +3*E3)=3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +243*E3.\n\nContinuing, E3=3 +3*E2, so E8=3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +243*(3 +3*E2)=3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +729 +729*E2.\n\nSimilarly, E2=3 +3*E1=3 +12=15.\n\nSo, E8=3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +729 +729*15 +729*3.\n\nWait, no, that seems messy.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to realize that each substitution introduces a term multiplied by 3^{k}, but the coefficients are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the closed-form solution we have.\n\nGiven that we've computed both step-by-step and through the recurrence relation, and both give us 12027, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 12027.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of multiplications and additions.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like it's a repeating pattern, so maybe I can work from the inside out. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression.\n\nLooking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3). So, let me start there and work my way outward. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). Wait, let me check. The next one would be (1 + 3*(result from the previous step)). So, let's compute each level step by step.\n\nWait, actually, let me make sure I'm counting the number of levels correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. Starting from the left, I see the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))$. So, from the innermost, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so each level adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by starting from the innermost and working outward, computing each step as I go. Let me try that.\n\nLet me number each level from the inside out as Level 1 to Level 9, since I can see that there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, no, let me count again. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1+3(...)), so let me see how many times this occurs. The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))$. So, let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost, the first (1+3) is at the end, then each preceding one is another level. So, let me list them as Level 1 to Level 8, perhaps, because each 1+3(...) is a level, and the outermost 3*() is another level. Wait, maybe it's 9 levels. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, let me parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the last part is (1 + 3), which is the 9th level. Then each previous one is a level above. So, perhaps there are 9 levels, each being 1 + 3*(next level). Let me confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, starting with the innermost (1 + 3), then moving one step out each time. So, let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 27.\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to compute digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my levels to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each step again to ensure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n3*29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, this expression resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 levels of (1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step, we had Level 1 as (1+3) = 4, which is a_1. Then Level 2 is a_2 = 13, etc., up to Level 9, which is a_9 = 29524.\n\nWait, let me compute a_9 using the formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that's another way to confirm it. Thus, the result is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute 3*(29524) again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nThus, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Which confirms the result again.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each level step by step, starting with (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n3. For each subsequent level, compute 1 + 3*(previous level's result).\n\n4. After computing up to the 9th level, which gives 29,524, multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the recurrence relation approach, we found that each level a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and for n=9, that gives 29,524. Multiplying by 3 yields 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Level 1: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. Level 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Level 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Level 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Level 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Level 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Level 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Level 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Level 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Level 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive kind of structure. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested parentheses. \n\nSo, the innermost part is the last one: $1+3$. Let me write that down. \n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. The innermost expression is $1 + 3 = 4$.\n2. Then, moving one level out, we have another $1 + 3$, but wait, no, actually, each level is $1 + 3*(previous result)$. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as each layer being 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner layer.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression properly. The original expression is:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by the next inner expression). So, it's like a chain where each step is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). \n\nLet me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer wraps around with 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers? Wait, let me count:\n\nOriginal expression:\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(...\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) - that's the outermost layer.\n2. Then inside, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. Continuing, each time, it's another 3(1+3(...))\n\nI think there are 9 layers in total. Let me check: the innermost is (1+3), then each step adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1+3). Then layer 2: 3*(1 + layer1). Then layer3: 3*(1 + layer2), and so on up to layer9. \n\nSo, perhaps the way to compute this is to start from layer1 and compute each layer step by step, then use that result in the next layer. That seems manageable.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are getting big quickly, and maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, the same result. Maybe that's correct, but let me verify with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can see a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, especially if it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nWait, in this case, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + x), where x is the result from the inner layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then 15, 48, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute the terms:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 3*(1 + a1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na3 = 3*(1 + a2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the final value after 9 layers is 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. It says compute:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4, then each step is 3*(1 + previous). So, 9 layers in total, leading to 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a general formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C = 3 + 3C => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a1 = A*3^1 - 3/2 = 3A - 3/2 = 4\n\nThus, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nBut let's compute this for n=9.\n\na9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683\n\nThen, a9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 divided by 6 is 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 multiplied by 11: 3280.5 * 10 = 32805, plus 3280.5 = 36085.5\n\nSo, (11/6)*19683 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nSo, a9 = 36084, which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so n=9, leading to a9=36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute one more layer manually. Let's say layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48, which is correct. Then layer4: 3*(1 + 48)=147, which is also correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct, and the general formula also gives the same result, so I'm confident that 36084 is the right answer.\n\nTherefore, after carefully working through each layer and verifying with both step-by-step computation and a general formula, I conclude that the value of the expression is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 3 multiplied by (1 plus the result of the inner layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression after 9 layers is 36084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

So the innermost is Layer 1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because sometimes when I do quick multiplication, I might make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. Let me count again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Layer 1\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 \u2192 Layer 2\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 \u2192 Layer 3\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 \u2192 Layer 4\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 \u2192 Layer 5\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 \u2192 Layer 6\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 \u2192 Layer 7\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 \u2192 Layer 8\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 \u2192 Layer 9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again to ensure that I correctly accounted for all layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections. Each \"1+\" is followed by a \"(\", so let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each \"1+\" introduces a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1+\" occurs before a closing parenthesis.\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1+\" is followed by another layer. Let me count the number of \"1+\" sections:\n\n1. The first \"1+\" is at the beginning: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\n2. Then inside that, another \"1+\".\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many \"1+\" are there? Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3, each \"1+\" is part of a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+\" inside the parentheses.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first \"1+\" is at position 2. Then each subsequent \"1+\" is nested deeper. Let me count the number of \"1+\" sections:\n\n- The first \"1+\" is at the top level: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\n- Then inside that, another \"1+\": 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\n- Continuing this way, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many \"1+\" are there? Let me count:\n\n1. 3*(1+3(...\n\n2. ...1+3(...\n\n3. ...1+3(...\n\n4. ...1+3(...\n\n5. ...1+3(...\n\n6. ...1+3(...\n\n7. ...1+3(...\n\n8. ...1+3(...\n\n9. ...1+3))\n\nWait, so there are 9 \"1+\" sections, each introducing a new layer. Therefore, the innermost layer is Layer 9, which is (1+3). So, the number of layers I computed earlier is correct: 9 layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then the final result is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic again, because sometimes when I compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step, just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing the expression from the inside out, step by step, using another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to ensure that I didn't make any mistake in the recurrence approach, let me check for a smaller n.\n\nFor example, n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Which matches Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Which matches Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nSo, the formula works for the first few layers, so it's reliable.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nThe entire expression is then 3 times Layer 9:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive structure, where each part is similar to the whole. Maybe I can solve it by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write it out more clearly to visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from above)). Since the innermost was 4, the next level would be (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\nSecond level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now I can replace that part with 13. Moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that.\n\nThird level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so now I have 40. Let me go one level out again. Next is (1 + 3*40). Let me calculate that.\n\nFourth level: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWow, that's getting big quickly. Let me keep going. Next level out is (1 + 3*121). Let's compute that.\n\nFifth level: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWhoa, okay, this is increasing exponentially, I think. Let me proceed to the next level.\n\nSixth level: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nSeventh level: 1 + 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nEighth level: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute that. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that. 3280 times 3: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Yeah, so 9840 + 1 is 9841.\n\nNinth level: Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that. 3*9841: Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523, so adding those together: 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, that seems right? Let me double-check: 9841*3. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost parentheses, we have 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\nTenth level: 1 + 3*29524. Let me calculate 3*29524 first. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nSo, now we've computed the innermost parentheses all the way out to the outermost one, and the result inside the outermost parentheses is 88573. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, let's compute that.\n\nFinal step: 3 * 88573. Let me calculate that.\n\n3 * 80000 is 240000, 3 * 8000 is 24000, 3 * 500 is 1500, 3 * 70 is 210, 3 * 3 is 9. Let me add those up:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify 3*88573 another way.\n\nAlternatively, 88573 * 3:\n\n3*3 is 9, write down 9.\n\n7*3 is 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 is 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n8*3 is 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 is 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n8*3 is 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n0*3 is 0, plus 2 is 2, write down 2.\n\nWait, that might be confusing. Let me do it step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carryover 2\n\nWait, but there are no more digits, so we write 26 as 26? That can't be. Wait, maybe I messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 88573 is a 5-digit number: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 3 (units). So, when multiplying by 3, starting from units:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carryover 2\n\nSince there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 at the beginning.\n\nSo, the result is 265719. That matches my earlier calculation. So, 3*88573 is indeed 265719.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any errors in the intermediate steps because this number is quite large. Let me go through the levels again quickly to see if I made any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n11. 3*88573 = 265719\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step seems to be multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is the pattern here. So, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So, starting from 4, each subsequent level is 1 + 3*(previous). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. It's a finite geometric series, perhaps? Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). But since the inner part is similar to E, except it's one level less. Wait, but in this case, it's a finite number of levels, not infinite. So, maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nSo, E = 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, using the recurrence relation, I also get 265719.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_10, which is the term we need, n=10:\n\na_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147\n\nSo, a_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573\n\nWhich matches what I found earlier. Therefore, E = 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I also arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost term, each step is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, expanding the expression, we can see that each level contributes a term that is 3^k, where k is the level.\n\nWait, let me try to write the entire expression expanded.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step:\n\nFirst, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nAs we saw earlier, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, expanding the entire expression, E = 3*(a_10)\n\nWhere a_10 is as above.\n\nBut perhaps another way to think about it is to see how many times 3 is being multiplied. Each time we go out a level, we're adding another factor of 3.\n\nSo, the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nWith 9 sets of (1 + 3*...). Wait, let me count the number of (1 + 3*...). Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3*...). Since the original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3*...), right? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1 + 3*...): starting from the innermost, each layer adds one. So, from the innermost (1 + 3), then each layer out adds another (1 + 3*...). So, starting from 1 layer, up to 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3*, each subsequent (1 + 3*...). Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n10. 3*(1 + 3)\n\nWait, actually, there are 10 layers here, each time adding another 3* until the innermost (1 + 3). So, n=10, as we had earlier.\n\nTherefore, using the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=10, we get a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 88573, as before.\n\nThen, E = 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\n\nThen, 3*88573. Let me compute that again:\n\n88573 * 3:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carryover 2\n\nSince there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, writing it out: 2 6 5 7 1 9. Wait, that's 265719.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I thought of it as 265719, but writing it out digit by digit, it's 2 (from the carryover), then 6, 5, 7, 1, 9. So, 265719. That's correct.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me add 88573 three times to see if I get the same result.\n\n88573 + 88573 = 177146\n\n177146 + 88573 = ?\n\nLet me add 177146 + 80000 = 257146\n\n257146 + 8000 = 265146\n\n265146 + 500 = 265646\n\n265646 + 70 = 265716\n\n265716 + 3 = 265719\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*88573 is indeed 265719.\n\nTherefore, after computing step by step, using recurrence relations, and verifying with multiple methods, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 265719.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n10. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\).\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 88573 = 265719\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{265719}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. It starts with the innermost part and works its way out. So, maybe I should start by solving the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. That seems like a logical approach because each part depends on the result of the previous one.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, counting the number of 3s... Let me see, each time there's a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, and inside each parenthesis, it's 1 plus another 3 times something. So, it's like a chain of operations. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Then, that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer, and so on. So, it's a recursive kind of expression, where each layer depends on the previous one. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving outwards.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost. Let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(result from layer 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(result from layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(result from layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(result from layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(result from layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(result from layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(result from layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(result from layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by the result from layer 9. So, 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524. Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute 29,524 * 3 properly.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I added 29,524 * 3, I thought it was 88,572, but let me confirm:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n----------\n\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit is 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 another way.\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since it's only nine layers, manually computing each step isn't too bad. But just for practice, maybe I can try to find a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers.\n\nBut since there are only nine layers, computing each step was manageable.\n\nIn summary, by computing each nested layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrived at the solution 88,572. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous result). By calculating each layer sequentially, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a nested series of operations where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer's result).\n\n2. **Compute each layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3:** 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's compute that first. \n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, it's 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(something)). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3).

Let me see if I can find a pattern or perhaps a formula instead of computing each layer manually, as this might take too long and there's a high chance of error.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nWait, so each layer is defined as L(n) = 3*(1 + 3*L(n-1)).\n\nSo, L(n) = 3*(1 + 3*L(n-1)).\n\nLet me try to expand this recursively.\n\nStarting from L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L(2) = 3*(1 + 3*L(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nL(3) = 3*(1 + 3*L(2)) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nL(4) = 3*(1 + 3*L(3)) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nHmm, so each L(n) = 3*(1 + 3*L(n-1)).\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for L(n).\n\nLet me expand the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nL(1) = 4.\n\nL(2) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39.\n\nL(3) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(118) = 354.\n\nL(4) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1063) = 3189.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express this recurrence relation as L(n) = 3 + 9*L(n-1).\n\nWait, because 3*(1 + 3*L(n-1)) = 3*1 + 3*3*L(n-1) = 3 + 9*L(n-1).\n\nSo, L(n) = 9*L(n-1) + 3.\n\nHmm, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 9*L(n-1) + 3, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: L(n) = 9*L(n-1).\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 9, so the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*9^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 9*A + 3.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 9*A = 3 => -8*A = 3 => A = -3/8.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*9^n - 3/8.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*9^1 - 3/8 => 4 = 9C - 3/8.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n9C = 4 + 3/8 = 32/8 + 3/8 = 35/8.\n\nThus, C = (35/8)/9 = 35/(8*9) = 35/72.\n\nSo, the general formula is L(n) = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nLet me check this for n=1.\n\nL(1) = (35/72)*9^1 - 3/8 = (35/72)*9 - 3/8.\n\n35/72 * 9 = (35*9)/72 = 315/72 = 35/8.\n\nSo, 35/8 - 3/8 = 32/8 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, check for n=2.\n\nL(2) = (35/72)*9^2 - 3/8 = (35/72)*81 - 3/8.\n\n35/72 *81 = (35*81)/72 = (35*9*9)/(8*9) )= (35*9)/8 = 315/8.\n\n315/8 - 3/8 = 312/8 = 39. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works for n=1 and n=2.\n\nSo, now, since we have the general formula, we can compute L(n) for any n without computing each layer step by step.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers we actually have.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent 3*(1 + 3*(...)) adds another layer.\n\nWait, so from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3 expressions. Each time, it's (1 + 3*(...)), so each one adds a layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the initial 3*(, there are 8 more 1 + 3*(...)) expressions. Wait, perhaps I should count the number of 1 + 3's.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each of those adds a layer. So, including the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) is a new layer. So, how many such layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, from the innermost, there are 8 more layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)), right? Because the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3*(, there are 8 more 1 + 3*(...) expressions. So, in total, from the innermost, it's 8 layers beyond the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, so perhaps the total number of layers is 9, including the innermost.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, when I computed L(1) through L(4), each L(n) was a layer beyond the innermost. So, if the innermost is L(1), then L(9) would be the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3 in the original expression.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the 9-layer expression. So, perhaps I need to compute up to L(9), and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(L(9)), where L(9) is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, each of those 1 + 3*(...) is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3, except the outermost which is just multiplied by 3 once.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as having 8 layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step up to L(9) and see what happens.\n\nSo, using the formula L(n) = 9*L(n-1) + 3, with L(1) = 4.\n\nWe can compute up to L(9).\n\nLet me compute each L(n) step by step:\n\nL(1) = 4.\n\nL(2) = 9*4 + 3 = 36 + 3 = 39.\n\nL(3) = 9*39 + 3 = 351 + 3 = 354.\n\nL(4) = 9*354 + 3 = 3186 + 3 = 3189.\n\nL(5) = 9*3189 + 3 = 28,701 + 3 = 28,704.\n\nL(6) = 9*28,704 + 3 = 258,336 + 3 = 258,339.\n\nL(7) = 9*258,339 + 3 = 2,325,051 + 3 = 2,325,054.\n\nL(8) = 9*2,325,054 + 3 = 20,925,486 + 3 = 20,925,489.\n\nL(9) = 9*20,925,489 + 3 = 188,329,401 + 3 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, so L(9) is 188,329,404.\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(L(9)).\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which we've been computing as L(n). So, perhaps L(9) is the value inside the outermost 3*(...), so the total expression is 3*(L(9)).\n\nWait, but no, in our earlier setup, L(n) is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so L(9) would be the outermost expression.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in our initial setup, L(n) = 3*(1 + 3*L(n-1)).\n\nSo, L(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12? Wait, no, that contradicts earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining L(n). Let me go back.\n\nWait, originally, I thought L(1) was (1 + 3) = 4, then L(2) was 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39, etc.\n\nBut perhaps that's not correct because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))).\n\nSo, perhaps L(n) should be defined as 3*(1 + 3*L(n-1)), starting with L(0) = 1.\n\nWait, maybe I need to redefine the layers.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nLet me consider that the innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, so layer 9 is 188,329,404.\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, perhaps the total expression is 3*(layer 9). But wait, no, because layer 9 is already 3*(...), so the original expression is 3*(layer 9). Wait, that can't be because layer 9 is 3*(something), so the original expression would be 3*(3*(something)), which would be 9*(something). Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's 1 layer.\n\nThen each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) adds another layer. So, how many layers of 3*(...) are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) expressions.\n\nFrom the innermost, after (1 + 3), there are 8 more 3*(1 + 3*(...)) expressions. So, total layers of 3*(...) is 8, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the layers as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*Layer1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*Layer2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 354.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*Layer3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3189.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*Layer4) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 28,704.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*Layer5) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 258,339.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*Layer6) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 2,325,054.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*Layer7) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 20,925,489.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*Layer8) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, so layer 9 is 188,329,404.\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, does that mean that the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9)? Or is layer 9 the outermost expression?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the original expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each time we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and this happens 8 times, right? Because from the innermost, we have 8 more layers of 3*(...).\n\nWait, so perhaps the total number of layers is 9: 1 innermost (1 + 3), and 8 layers of 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, layer 9 was 188,329,404, which would be the result of 3*(1 + 3*Layer8). So, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is layer 9. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me check that.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... is the rest. So, if the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). So, after 9 layers, we get 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=1.\n\nIf n=1, the expression is 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nBut according to my earlier formula, L(1) = 4, and then 3*L(1) = 12, which would be the correct result for n=1.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39, which is correct.\n\nWait, so perhaps in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers of 3*(...), so the total number of layers is 9, including the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) layers being 8, so the total expression is 3*(L(8)), where L(8) is computed as per the layers.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.\n\nWait, let me just compute each layer step by step up to the 9th layer and see what I get.\n\nWait, I did compute up to L(9) = 188,329,404.\n\nBut according to the original expression, that's the value of the entire expression, right? Because each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and after 9 layers, we get 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have an expression with only 2 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 3 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354. Correct.\n\nSo, if I have 9 layers, the result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me check using the formula I derived earlier: L(n) = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8.\n\nWait, 9^9 is a huge number: 9^1=9, 9^2=81, 9^3=729, 9^4=6561, 9^5=59049, 9^6=531441, 9^7=4782969, 9^8=43046721, 9^9=387,420,489.\n\nSo, (35/72)*387,420,489 = ?\n\n35/72 is approximately 0.486111...\n\nBut let me compute it exactly.\n\n35/72 * 387,420,489 = ?\n\nFirst, compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72.\n\n387,420,489 \u00f7 72:\n\n72 \u00d7 5,381,118 = 387,420,456.\n\n387,420,489 - 387,420,456 = 33.\n\nSo, 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 = 5,381,118 with a remainder of 33, which is 5,381,118 + 33/72 = 5,381,118 + 11/24 \u2248 5,381,118.458333...\n\nThen, multiply by 35:\n\n5,381,118.458333... \u00d7 35.\n\nLet me compute 5,381,118 \u00d7 35 = ?\n\n5,381,118 \u00d7 35:\n\n= 5,381,118 \u00d7 30 = 161,433,540\n\n+ 5,381,118 \u00d7 5 = 26,905,590\n\nTotal = 161,433,540 + 26,905,590 = 188,339,130.\n\nNow, add the 0.458333... \u00d735:\n\n0.458333... \u00d735 = (11/24) \u00d735 = 385/24 \u2248 16.041666...\n\nSo, total is approximately 188,339,130 + 16.041666 \u2248 188,339,146.041666...\n\nThen, subtract 3/8 = 0.375.\n\nSo, L(9) \u2248 188,339,146.041666... - 0.375 \u2248 188,339,145.666666...\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got L(9) = 188,329,404, which is significantly different. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, that can't be. There must be a mistake in my formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the recurrence relation.\n\nLet me go back and check my earlier steps.\n\nWe had the recurrence L(n) = 9*L(n-1) + 3, with L(1) = 4.\n\nI tried to solve this as a linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*9^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, I assumed L_p(n) = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 9*A + 3 \u21d2 A - 9A = 3 \u21d2 -8A = 3 \u21d2 A = -3/8.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = C*9^n - 3/8.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*9^1 - 3/8 \u21d2 4 = 9C - 3/8 \u21d2 9C = 4 + 3/8 = 32/8 + 3/8 = 35/8 \u21d2 C = 35/(8*9) = 35/72.\n\nThus, L(n) = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nWait, but when I compute L(9) using this formula, I get approximately 188,339,145.666..., which doesn't match the step-by-step computation of 188,329,404.\n\nWait, that suggests that either my step-by-step computation is wrong, or my formula is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check L(2) using the formula.\n\nL(2) should be 39.\n\nUsing the formula: L(2) = (35/72)*9^2 - 3/8.\n\n9^2 = 81.\n\nSo, (35/72)*81 = (35*81)/72 = (35*9*9)/(8*9) = (35*9)/8 = 315/8 = 39.375.\n\nThen, subtract 3/8: 39.375 - 0.375 = 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, L(3) = (35/72)*9^3 - 3/8.\n\n9^3 = 729.\n\n(35/72)*729 = (35*729)/72 = (35*10.125) = 354.375.\n\nSubtract 3/8: 354.375 - 0.375 = 354. Correct.\n\nL(4) = (35/72)*9^4 - 3/8.\n\n9^4 = 6561.\n\n(35/72)*6561 = (35*6561)/72.\n\n6561 \u00f7 72 = 91.125.\n\n3"

It seems like it's a repeating pattern, so maybe I can compute it from the inside out. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me write it down as it is to visualize better:\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. So, it's like each step is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Hmm, that might form a pattern or even a geometric series. Let me try to compute it step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a separate computation. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check that.

So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, but each inner operation is 1 + 3*(next inner). So, perhaps it's better to compute starting from the innermost and moving outward.

So, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me compute each layer one by one.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3: \n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n--------\n\n29524\n\n\u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, with each layer, we're adding another 3*(...). So, with nine layers, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, yes, nine layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, perhaps we can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me verify 29524*3 again.\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n--------\n\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the closed-form formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost layer and work our way out. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nHmm, so it's a nested expression where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). It seems like a recursive structure, maybe? Let me try to write it out more clearly. So starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me count how many layers there are. \n\nLooking at the problem, I can see that the innermost part is (1+3), then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and this repeats multiple times. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. Starting from the left: 3(...), so that's the first layer. Then inside that, another 3(...), so that's the second layer, and so on. Let me count them: 3(...), 3(...), 3(...), 3(...), 3(...), 3(...), 3(...), 3(...), 3(...). So that's nine layers of 3(...). So it's like 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times ... )) with nine layers. \n\nWait, but when I count the opening parentheses, starting from the first one after the first 3, I see that each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me check again: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each time a (1+3(...)). So how many times does this happen? Let's see: \n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the initial one. The initial 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), so that's the first layer. Then inside that, another 3(...), so that's the second layer. Continuing this way, how many layers do we have? Let's see:\n\n- The first layer is 3(1+3(...))\n- The second layer is inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n- Third layer: 3(1+3(...))\n- Fourth layer: 3(1+3(...))\n- Fifth layer: 3(1+3(...))\n- Sixth layer: 3(1+3(...))\n- Seventh layer: 3(1+3(...))\n- Eighth layer: 3(1+3(...))\n- Ninth layer: 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I think there are eight more opening parentheses, so maybe nine layers in total. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's write it as:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3( ... ))\n\nLayer 2: 3(1 + 3( ... ))\n\nAnd so on until Layer 9. So, actually, there are nine layers of 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: 1 + 3. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9), Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on until Layer 1, which is multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nWait, but maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way outwards. That might make it easier. Let me try that.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nWait, no, that might get confusing because the innermost is Layer 1, and each outer layer is adding another 3(...). Let me try to write each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by computing the innermost expression first.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(L1) + 1, which would be:\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, the next layer out would be:\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but that seems too big. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and each time we multiply by 3 again. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each layer as 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check my calculations step by step because maybe I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's count how many times this happens.\n\nEach time we move outward, we add another layer. So:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems correct, but let me check each step again because it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify using a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula here.\n\nI notice that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but actually, in this case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c))*(c)^{n-1} + d/(1 - c), provided c \u2260 1.\n\nIn our case, c = 3 and d = 1.\n\nSo, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3))*(3)^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3).\n\nSimplifying, 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (a_1 - (-1/2))*(3)^{n-1} + (-1/2).\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, we have:\n\na_n = (4 + 1/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nSimplify 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (9/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nNow, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (9/2)*(3)^{8} - 1/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2\n\nCompute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = 59049, then divided by 2: 59049/2 = 29524.5\n\nThen subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524.\n\nSo, a_9 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this using another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can compute each a_n step by step up to a_9, which we did earlier, and each step gave us the same result, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expression by expanding it step by step without using the formula. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo,\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the previous methods. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution we found earlier is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^8 - 1/2 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = (59049/2) - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nWait, so is the answer 88572? That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again, maybe using a table to keep track.\n\nLayer | Calculation | Result\n-----|-------------|-------\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524\nTotal| 3*29524     | 88572\n\nYes, that looks consistent. Each step builds correctly on the previous one. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out the entire expression step by step, expanding each layer.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 3*(13) = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 3*(40) = 120, 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 3*(121) = 363, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 3*(364) = 1092, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 3*(1093) = 3279, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 3*(3280) = 9840, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 3*(9841) = 29523, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result every time. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) using a different approach, perhaps recognizing it as a geometric progression.\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I think of the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIt's like a series of nested 1 + 3*... terms, nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but each time, the inner expression is 1 + 3*(next inner expression). So, maybe I can represent this as a sum.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series where each term is 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so maybe the sum is something like 3^{9} + 3^{8} + ... + 3^{0}.\n\nWait, but let's see: Let me think about the expansion.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand this, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it.\n\nWait, let me try to see:\n\nThe innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8 because there are 8 layers above it. Then the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the first 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nSo, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) would be:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nExpanding this, it's:\n\n1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1\n\nSo, the sum would be 1*(3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^9 - 1)/2\n\nWait, because the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nWait, in this case, the number of terms is 9, so n=8, because starting from 3^0 up to 3^8.\n\nWait, so sum = (3^{9} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but that's the value of the inner expression before the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but according to this, the inner expression is 9841, then multiplied by 3 gives 3*9841 = 29523, but that contradicts our earlier result of 29524 before the final multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. When we expand the expression, each 1 is at a different level of multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to model the expansion properly.\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand the innermost part first:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 3*(13) = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, so each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's not a simple geometric series because each term is built upon the previous one, not just adding 3^k*1 each time.\n\nSo, perhaps my earlier approach using the recurrence relation is more accurate.\n\nWait, but according to the expansion approach, I got 9841, but according to the step-by-step calculation, the inner expression before the final multiplication was 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the geometric series approach. Let me try to model it correctly.\n\nWait, each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, each layer is 1 + 3*a, where a is the next layer.\n\nSo, if we denote each layer as a_i, where i is from 1 to 9, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{i} = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}.\n\nThen, as we calculated before, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series is perhaps not directly applicable here because each term depends on the previous one multiplicatively, not additively.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence relation solution.\n\nIn any case, all methods so far have led me to the same result of 88572, so I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying using different methods, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost layer and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move outward and compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that it's a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to follow a similar pattern: 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions because you can simplify them one step at a time without getting overwhelmed.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nI think I should start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). So, replacing the innermost part, the next layer becomes:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing that correctly. So, each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the inside:\n\n1st layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2nd layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3rd layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4th layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, hold on, this seems like it's growing pretty quickly. Let me check each step carefully because if I make a mistake here, the whole answer will be off.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6.

Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me verify each step because it's easy to make a multiplication error here.\n\nLet me write down each step clearly:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Move out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093). Compute 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280). Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841). Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524). Compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, add them up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step is correct, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation, especially since it's a repeated pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That sounds like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively.\n\nLet me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to a\u2089, since there are 9 layers of parentheses starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, in general, a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1.\n\nSolving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a\u2081=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3\u00b9 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the initial terms.\n\nFor n=1: a\u2081 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, since there are 9 layers, a\u2089 = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nTo verify, we use the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). The closed-form solution is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), we get \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Thus, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Then, we add 1 to that, so $1 + 12 = 13$. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, it's 3 times (1 plus something). So starting from the inside:\n\n1.

Finally, the outermost level: $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the number of levels. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). So, let's list them step by step.\n\n1.

Ninth level: $3 \\times 9841 + 1 = 29524$\n10. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3: $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps? But the original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me see:\n\nEach time, you have a 1 + 3(...). So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 3*s. So, starting from the innermost, each step adds one more layer. So, actually, there are nine layers, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nLet me define each step as a level, starting from level 1 as the innermost.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) + 1 = 3*4 +1 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 3*(Level 2) +1 = 3*13 +1 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 3*(Level 3) +1 = 3*40 +1 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 3*(Level 4) +1 = 3*121 +1 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 3*(Level 5) +1 = 3*364 +1 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 3*(Level 6) +1 = 3*1093 +1 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 3*(Level 7) +1 = 3*3280 +1 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 3*(Level 8) +1 = 3*9841 +1 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Level 9, we have to multiply by 3 again.\n\nSo, Level 10: 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 10 steps, but the original problem has nine sets of parentheses, meaning nine levels inside, and then the final multiplication by 3 outside.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the expression as starting with the innermost 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 3*(previous result) +1, and after nine layers, we multiply by 3 again.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each time we go out one layer, we do 3*(previous result) +1.\n\nSo, let's count the number of innermost expressions. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (this is the first innermost, let's call this layer 1)\n2. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer 2)\n3. Next, 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (layer3)\n4. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121 (layer4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (layer5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (layer6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (layer7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (layer8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (layer9)\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 10 steps, but since the outermost is just a multiplication by 3, not another layer, maybe the layers are 9, and then the final multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is layer1: 1+3, then layer2: 3*(layer1)+1, up to layer9: 3*(layer8)+1, and then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, that would make sense.\n\nSo, to clarify, the innermost is layer1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 3*(previous layer) +1.\n\nSo, layer2: 3*4 +1=13\n\nlayer3: 3*13 +1=40\n\nlayer4: 3*40 +1=121\n\nlayer5: 3*121 +1=364\n\nlayer6: 3*364 +1=1093\n\nlayer7: 3*1093 +1=3280\n\nlayer8: 3*3280 +1=9841\n\nlayer9: 3*9841 +1=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that's the computation.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's go through each step again:\n\n1. layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. layer2: 3*4 +1 = 12 +1 =13\n\n3. layer3: 3*13 +1 = 39 +1=40\n\n4. layer4: 3*40 +1=120 +1=121\n\n5. layer5: 3*121 +1=363 +1=364\n\n6. layer6: 3*364 +1=1092 +1=1093\n\n7. layer7: 3*1093 +1=3279 +1=3280\n\n8. layer8: 3*3280 +1=9840 +1=9841\n\n9. layer9: 3*9841 +1=29523 +1=29524\n\n10. final result: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each step, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1, except for the innermost step where it's just 1 + 3.\n\nAlternatively, this seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think if there's a formula for such a structure.\n\nIn general, for an expression like a nested multiplication and addition, sometimes you can find a pattern or a formula to compute it without expanding each step. Let me see if that's possible here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nAfter layer1: 4\n\nAfter layer2: 13\n\nAfter layer3: 40\n\nAfter layer4: 121\n\nAfter layer5: 364\n\nAfter layer6: 1093\n\nAfter layer7: 3280\n\nAfter layer8: 9841\n\nAfter layer9: 29524\n\nI can see that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1 =4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 is 4, which is the innermost layer. Then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1.\n\nSolving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the value after 9 layers is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify the computation step by step without using the formula, to ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes.\n\nStarting from layer1: 1 +3=4\n\nlayer2: 3*4 +1=12 +1=13\n\nlayer3: 3*13 +1=39 +1=40\n\nlayer4: 3*40 +1=120 +1=121\n\nlayer5: 3*121 +1=363 +1=364\n\nlayer6: 3*364 +1=1092 +1=1093\n\nlayer7: 3*1093 +1=3279 +1=3280\n\nlayer8: 3*3280 +1=9840 +1=9841\n\nlayer9: 3*9841 +1=29523 +1=29524\n\nThen, final step: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write this as a formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived earlier.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or the computations. Each step logically follows, and the use of the recurrence relation formula confirms the result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a geometric progression. Using the recurrence relation, the final result is computed as 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. It seems like each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nI think it would help to count how many layers there are. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, I see there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, each time it's 3*(1 + ...), so maybe each layer is one more 3. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each next layer is 3*(1 + that result). So perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to parse this step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outward, so let's define each step as follows:\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression first.\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm correctly identifying each layer. Let me try to write each layer as I go outwards.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to represent the expression with indices. Let me define each nested part as a function f(n), where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3. Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1). Similarly, f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2), and so on, up to f(9), and then the entire expression is 3*f(9). Hmm, that might be a systematic way to approach it.\n\nWait, but let me check: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, we have 3*(1 + previous result). So, yes, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, let me compute each f(n) step by step:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems correct, but let me check again because when I did f(9), I got 29524, so 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nBut let me check if I computed f(9) correctly.\n\nWait, f(1)=4\n\nf(2)=1 + 3*4=13\n\nf(3)=1 + 3*13=40\n\nf(4)=1 + 3*40=121\n\nf(5)=1 + 3*121=364\n\nf(6)=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nf(7)=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nf(8)=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nf(9)=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but 3*9841: Let me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So that's correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the f(n) computations. Let me go through each step again.\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps look correct. Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check if I interpreted the original expression correctly. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, each time, we have f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), starting from f(1)=4, and going up to f(9). Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step without using the function f(n). Let me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, hold on, this is different from before. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the original problem, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, and so on.\n\nWait, but in my previous approach, I considered f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). But now, when I compute it this way, I'm getting different results.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the function f(n). Let me see.\n\nWait, in the original problem, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation using f(n), I had f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), which would give f(1)=4, f(2)=13, f(3)=40, etc., but when I compute it as 3*(1 + previous result), I'm getting different numbers.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I didn't account for the multiplication by 3 correctly.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but that's only eight layers. Wait, no, let me count again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with each layer adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from (1 + 3) as layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... ) parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n10. 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the original expression only has nine layers. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me look at the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... ) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). So, let me count the number of times 3*(1 + ... ) occurs.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, there are nine 3*(1 + ... ) terms, each nesting one more layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from 4, then:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n2. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n3. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n4. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n5. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n6. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n7. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n8. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n9. 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nWait, so after nine layers, we get 108255, and then the entire expression is 3*108255 = 324765.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my previous calculation where I got 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, so which approach is correct? Let me figure this out.\n\nIn the first approach, I defined f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), starting from f(1)=4, and computed up to f(9)=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nIn the second approach, I computed each layer as 3*(1 + previous result), starting from 4, and after nine layers, I got 108255, then multiplied by 3 to get 324765.\n\nWait, these two results are different, so one of the approaches must be wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the structure of the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Wait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252? Wait, no, wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... ) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because each time we have 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to layer 9, I got 36084, and then the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought that the entire expression is 3*f(9), where f(9) = 29524, leading to 88572. But now, in the second approach, I get 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, which one is correct? Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the function f(n) in the first approach. Let me re-examine that.\n\nIn the first approach, I thought of f(n) as 1 + 3*f(n-1), starting from f(1)=4. Then, f(2)=1 + 3*4=13, f(3)=1 + 3*13=40, etc., up to f(9)=29524, then 3*f(9)=88572.\n\nBut in the second approach, I computed each layer as 3*(1 + previous result), starting from 4, and after nine layers, I got 36084, then multiplied by 3 to get 108252.\n\nWait, the discrepancy arises from how I'm counting the layers. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the function f(n) is being applied correctly. Let me try to write the entire expression step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought of f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), but that seems to not align with the actual layers. Because in the second approach, each layer is 3*(1 + previous), which would correspond to f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)).\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial function definition was wrong. Let me see.\n\nIn the first approach, I defined f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + previous), so f(n) should be 3*(1 + f(n-1)). That makes more sense.\n\nWait, that would mean that f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). So, starting with f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12? Wait, no, because the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is f(2)=15.\n\nWait, perhaps f(n) is defined as the value after n layers, so f(1)=4, f(2)=15, f(3)=48, etc.\n\nWait, so f(1) = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*36084 = 108252\n\nWait, so in this case, the function f(n) is defined as f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1)=4.\n\nBut in my initial approach, I defined f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), which led to a different result. So, that was my mistake. The correct definition should be f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), not 1 + 3*f(n-1). That explains the discrepancy.\n\nSo, with this correction, the value of f(9) is 36084, and then the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Let me compute f(n) correctly this time.\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*36084 to confirm:\n\n36084 * 3:\n\nCompute 30000*3 = 90000\n\n6000*3 = 18000\n\n80*3 = 240\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 90000 + 18000 = 108000\n\n108000 + 240 = 108240\n\n108240 + 12 = 108252\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, so my initial approach was wrong because I incorrectly defined f(n) as 1 + 3*f(n-1) instead of 3*(1 + f(n-1)). That's why I got a different answer.\n\nSo, the correct result is 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I'm computing the right number of layers.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of 3*(1 + ... ) terms, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time we have a 3*(1 + ...), so how many such terms are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n10. 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nWait, now I'm confused again because I thought there were nine layers, but when I count the number of 3*(1 + ... ) terms, I get ten. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me write the expression with indices to count the layers correctly.\n\nLet me consider the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... ) terms.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252\n\nWait, so there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ... ), starting from Layer1 to Layer9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, after nine layers, we get 36084, then the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, but when I initially thought of f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1)=4, and computed up to f(9)=36084, then multiplied by 3 to get 108252, that seems correct.\n\nBut in my first approach, I incorrectly defined f(n) as 1 + 3*f(n-1), which led me to f(9)=29524 and then 88572, which is wrong.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to define f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1)=4, and compute up to f(9)=36084, then multiply by 3 to get 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my function definition is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute this:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(15) = 45.\n\nAlternatively, using f(n):\n\nf(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12? Wait, no, wait, if f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), then:\n\nWait, no, wait, in the smaller example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nSo, innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*15 = 45.\n\nIf I use f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1)=4:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(2) = 3*15 = 45, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in this case, f(2) is the value after two layers, so the entire expression is 3*f(2). Similarly, in the original problem, after nine layers, we have f(9)=36084, and the entire expression is 3*f(9)=108252.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought of f(n) as 1 + 3*f(n-1), which was incorrect because the structure is 3*(1 + f(n-1)), not 1 + 3*f(n-1).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I'm a bit confused.\n\nLet me compute the smaller example using both approaches.\n\nApproach 1: f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), f(1)=4.\n\nf(1)=4\n\nf(2)=3*(1 + 4)=15\n\nEntire expression: 3*f(2)=45 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nApproach 2: f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), f(1)=4\n\nf(1)=4\n\nf(2)=1 + 3*4=13\n\nEntire expression: 3*f(2)=39, which is incorrect because the correct value is 45.\n\nSo, Approach 2 is wrong, Approach 1 is correct.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, using Approach 1, we get the correct answer of 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check another smaller example to be sure.\n\nTake the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nEntire expression: 3*48 = 144\n\nUsing f(n):\n\nf(1)=4\n\nf(2)=3*(1 + 4)=15\n\nf(3)=3*(1 + 15)=48\n\nEntire expression: 3*f(3)=144 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, Approach 1 works correctly.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the correct answer is 108252.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed using Approach 1, I got f(9)=36084, then 3*36084=108252.\n\nWait, let me compute 3*36084 again to be sure.\n\n36084 * 3:\n\nCompute 30000*3=90000\n\n6000*3=18000\n\n80*3=240\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding up: 90000 + 18000 = 108000\n\n108000 + 240 = 108240\n\n108240 + 12 = 108252 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 108252.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought my initial approach was correct, but now I'm seeing that Approach 1 was wrong, and Approach 2 is correct, leading to 108252.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is 108252.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more by computing each layer step by step.\n\n"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then multiplied by 3, and then added to another similar term. It seems like a recursive or repetitive pattern. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle. That usually works with nested expressions, right?\n\nSo, let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1+3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nCompute (1 + 3):\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, let's move one level out. The next set of parentheses would then be 1 + 3*(result from the innermost part). Wait, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each level is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So maybe each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me confirm that.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) So each time, it's 3 times (1 plus another similar term). So if I start from the innermost, each time I go out, I compute 3*(1 + previous value). Hmm, that sounds like a recursive sequence.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me count how many levels there are. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we go one level up, and we have nine levels in total. So, starting from Level 1 to Level 9. So, the outermost Level 9 would be the final result. So, according to my calculations above, Level 9 is 36084. Hmm, that seems quite large, but let's see if it's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the counting of levels. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, there are nine 3s, each followed by a (1 + ...). So that means we have nine levels. Therefore, my previous calculation up to Level 9 is correct, giving 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step is multiplying 3 by (1 + the previous result). So, each time, the value inside the parentheses is 1 + the previous level's result, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I let each level be a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4, then perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nWait, let's see: a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, the pattern is each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWe can write this as: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3\n\nSolve for C: C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3A => 11/2 = 3A => A = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify: (11/6)*3^n = 11*(3^n)/6 = 11*(3^{n-1})/2\n\nSo, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (11/2)*3^{0} - 3/2 = (11/2)*1 - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: a_2 = (11/2)*3^{1} - 3/2 = (11/2)*3 - 3/2 = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15, which matches.\n\nn=3: (11/2)*9 - 3/2 = (99/2) - (3/2) = 96/2 = 48, correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (11/2)*3^{8} - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/2)*6561 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/2)*6561: 11*6561 = let's compute that.\n\nCompute 10*6561 = 65,610\n\nCompute 1*6561 = 6,561\n\nAdd them: 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171\n\nSo, (11/2)*6561 = 72,171 / 2 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2: 36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nWhich is the same as 36,084, which is 36084. So, that matches my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me recount the levels. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so n=9. So, yes, a_9 is indeed the result, which is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a sum of a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a recurrence relation.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, it's like each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Hmm, that's consistent with the recurrence relation I had before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a sum. Let me see.\n\nIf I write out the expression, it's:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, if I let each innermost term be x, then each level is 3*(1 + x). So, it's like building up the expression from the inside out, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, from the formula a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2, and when n=9, a_9 = (11/2)*3^8 - 3/2 = (11/2)*6561 - 3/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 11*6561: 10*6561=65,610; 1*6561=6,561; total=72,171\n\nSo, (72,171 - 3)/2 = 72,168/2 = 36,084, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the expression as a sum of 3^k terms, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that each time you have 3*(1 + previous term). So, the entire expression can be seen as 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... up to some terms. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression step by step, just to see if I can see a pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, each level is 3*(1 + previous level). So, the value at each level is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula I derived earlier is correct, and the final answer is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the expression by expanding all the parentheses. Maybe that's another way to approach it, although it might be more tedious.\n\nLet me write the expression step by step, expanding each set of parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nExpression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, replace the innermost parentheses with 4:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nStep 2: Compute the next parentheses: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, no, actually, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15, but then the next level is 3*(1 + 15). Wait, I think I confused myself here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to process each level step by step, as I did before, rather than trying to expand all at once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write it as 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... up to a certain number of terms, but let me check.\n\nWait, when I expand the expression, each level adds another term. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nAnd so on, up to nine levels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider that each time, the term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, if I let T be the total value, then T = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but since it's nine levels, it's finite.\n\nWait, but in the case of an infinite series, this would approach a limit, but here it's finite, so the formula I derived earlier is more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that each level is 3 times (1 plus the previous level). So, starting from level 1 as 4, each subsequent level is 3*(1 + previous level). So, the sequence is 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084.\n\nYes, that's nine terms, starting from level 1 to level 9, with level 9 being the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it step by step, and the formula using the recurrence relation also gives the same result. So, I'm confident that 36,084 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost part:\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move one level out:\n   \\[ 3(1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each level:\n   \\[ 3(1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084 \\]\n\nThus, the final result after computing all levels is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that it's a nested expression, meaning there are multiple layers of parentheses inside each other. So, the way to tackle this is probably to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because each parenthesis depends on the result of the one inside it. So, let me try to write this out step by step.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost parentheses. Wait, let me check: the next layer is (1 + 3*(inner result)). So, let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me list each layer from the innermost to the outermost. There are nine layers in total because each \"1+3\" is followed by another layer until the ninth one.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression, it's $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3*(previous result)).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to number them from the inside out.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly. Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of layers. Each time there's a \"3(\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the innermost is only one (1+3). Wait, perhaps I should think of each \"1+3(...)\" as a layer.\n\nLet me try to write it as layers, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, but looking at the original expression, it's 3*(Layer9). So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote Layer1 as (1 + 3). Then Layer2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), Layer3 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), and so on until Layer9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is (1 + 3), then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this repeats until the ninth layer, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, Layer9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the outermost layer 3*(Layer9) or is Layer9 the innermost? Wait, no, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...), and the outermost is 3*(...). So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term.\n\nWait, but in this case, the number of layers is 9, starting from (1+3), then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value of the nth layer from the inside out. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me substitute into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, a_{n} = A*3^n + B\n\na_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. So, a_9 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with the step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the initial condition is correctly applied. Since a_1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is (1+3) = 4, and the layers go up to a_9, which is the ninth layer from the inside. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's like a geometric progression with ratio 3, but with an added 1 each time.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to model it as a sum.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote the innermost as S, then each layer adds a term. But I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). So, with nine layers of 3*(...).\n\nWait, but regardless, the step-by-step approach seems solid, and the closed-form formula also gives the same result, so I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using a different approach, like expanding the expression. But given the depth of nesting, that might be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nWait, another thought: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so each layer can be represented as (3^{n} + 1)/2, but I think that's similar to the closed-form solution I found earlier.\n\nWait, from the closed-form, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like there are multiple layers here, so maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the inside: 1+3, then that result is inside another 1+3, and this repeats several times. Let me see, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one. Hmm, maybe it's easier to count the number of times \"1+3\" appears.\n\nLooking again, the innermost is 1+3. Then each time, that result is inside another 1+3. So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers here because each time you have a new set of parentheses, and I can see that the innermost is the 9th one. Let me confirm that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result2)\n4. 1 + 3*(result3)\n5. 1 + 3*(result4)\n6. 1 + 3*(result5)\n7. 1 + 3*(result6)\n8. 1 + 3*(result7)\n9. 1 + 3*(result8)\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(result9)\n\nWait, so maybe there are nine layers inside the outermost 3. Hmm, I might have miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent 3 is inside another set. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The first part is 3(1 + 3(...\n- Then, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...\n- And this continues until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, each time we have a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"3(\" appears after the first one.\n\nLooking at the expression, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...\n3. And this continues until the last one, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many 3( are there? Let me see:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is (1 + 3(1 + 3(...))...). So, the number of 3( after the first 3 is 8. Because each time you have a new 3(, except for the last one which is just 1 + 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The expression ends with )))))))) which is nine closing parentheses. So, that would mean there are nine layers, each adding a closing parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, each layer adds another closing parenthesis. So, the total number of layers is nine.\n\nWait, but the first 3 is outside all of that. So, the entire expression is 3*(something with nine layers inside). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nOkay, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572 (correct)\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. I assumed there were nine layers, but maybe I miscounted. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, and each is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: )))))))) that's nine closing parentheses. So, that means there are nine layers inside the initial 3. So, my count of nine layers is correct.\n\nTherefore, the computation seems accurate. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of operations where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nHmm, so it's a nested expression where each layer has 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). It seems like a repetitive pattern, so maybe I can work from the innermost part outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is the last (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+4)))))))))$\n\nWait, actually, let me check that. The innermost part is the last (1+3), which is the ninth one. So, I should compute that first and then work my way out. Maybe I should number each layer to keep track.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, starting from the innermost. So, L1 is (1+3). Then L2 is 3*(1 + L1), and so on. Wait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Hmm, maybe I should compute each layer step by step.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outwards, L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, each layer is 3*(1 + inner layer). So, L1 is (1+3)=4, then L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 +4)=15, then L3 is 3*(1 + L2)=3*(1 +15)=3*16=48, and so on.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm doing this right. Let me write down each layer:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 +4)=3*5=15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2)=3*(1 +15)=3*16=48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3)=3*(1 +48)=3*49=147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4)=3*(1 +147)=3*148=444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5)=3*(1 +444)=3*445=1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6)=3*(1 +1335)=3*1336=4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7)=3*(1 +4008)=3*4009=12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8)=3*(1 +12027)=3*12028=36084\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check each step carefully to avoid mistakes.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3) \u2192 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the next layer is 3*(1 +4)=15.\n\nThen, next: 3*(1 +15)=3*16=48.\n\nThen, 3*(1 +48)=3*49=147.\n\nThen, 3*(1 +147)=3*148=444.\n\nNext, 3*(1 +444)=3*445=1335.\n\nThen, 3*(1 +1335)=3*1336=4008.\n\nNext, 3*(1 +4008)=3*4009=12027.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(1 +12027)=3*12028=36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 3*(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then, moving out, each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So, let's count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 L1: 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + L1) \u2192 L2: 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + L2) \u2192 L3: 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + L3) \u2192 L4: 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + L4) \u2192 L5: 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + L5) \u2192 L6: 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + L6) \u2192 L7: 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + L7) \u2192 L8: 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + L8) \u2192 L9: 36084\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers in total. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 +4)=3*5=15\n\nL3: 3*(1 +15)=3*16=48\n\nL4: 3*(1 +48)=3*49=147\n\nL5: 3*(1 +147)=3*148=444\n\nL6: 3*(1 +444)=3*445=1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 +1335)=3*1336=4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 +4008)=3*4009=12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 +12027)=3*12028=36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can model it as a recurrence.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWait, but that's a recurrence relation. So, we can write it as:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWith a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3\n\n-2K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n = 1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C\n\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nBut let's check this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, let's check for n=2:\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 +4)=15\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15, which is correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\nSo, 3^9=19683\n\nNow, compute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 *11 = Let's compute:\n\n3280.5 *10 = 32805\n\n3280.5 *1 = 3280.5\n\nAdding together: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nWhich matches the earlier result of 36084.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms that the result is 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the innermost layer into the outer one. This process is repeated until we reach the outermost layer. \n\nBy breaking down each layer step by step, we find that the final result is 36084.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. \n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outwards, each layer is 3 times (1 + the next layer). Let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous result. Let me see: \n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, 3*(1 + result from step 1)\n3. Then, 3*(1 + result from step 2)\n...\nAnd this goes on until the outermost layer. I think there are 9 layers here because each \"1+\" is followed by another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, nine layers. So I'll need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9 for clarity. So layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), layer 2 is 3*(1 + layer 1), and so on until layer 9, which is the entire expression. \n\nStarting with layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, layer 2 is 3*(1 + layer 1). Since layer 1 is 4, layer 2 becomes:\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nMoving on to layer 3:\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4:\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5:\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6:\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7:\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8:\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9:\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that last step carefully. So, 1 + 12027 is 12028. Now, multiplying by 3: 12028 * 3. Hmm, let me break that down. \n\n12028 * 3: 12,000 * 3 is 36,000, and 28 * 3 is 84. So, adding those together, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. \n\nSo, layer 9 is 36,084. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 36,084. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of these calculations. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36,084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer's result is correct when checked. So, I think the final answer is 36,084. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that for a moment. \n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). That seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 15, a_3 = 48, and so on. \n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nSo, a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. \n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nSolving for A:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A => 11/2 = 3A => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, but maybe it's clearer as is.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - (3/2) = 96/2 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 3/2 = (297/2) - (3/2) = 294/2 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9, the value should be:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9 first: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, divide 19683 by 6: 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11\n\nCompute 3280 * 11 = 36,080\n\nCompute 0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation. That's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084. \n\nI think I've covered all the steps, both by computing each layer manually and by finding a general formula to confirm the result. It seems solid.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the innermost part outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. Let me try to write it out step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1+3. That's straightforward. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me check: the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next one is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*4: First, 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, maybe I should handle each multiplication as I go.\n\nLet me try to structure this properly. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, each time, we take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that becomes the next layer.\n\nBut wait, the original expression has multiple layers, so I need to see how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them.\n\nStarting after the first 3*: 1+3*(...), so that's the first layer. Then inside that, another 1+3*(...), that's the second layer, and so on. Let me count the number of times 1+3*( occurs. Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...\n2. ...1+3*(...\n3. ...1+3*(...\n4. ...1+3*(...\n5. ...1+3*(...\n6. ...1+3*(...\n7. ...1+3*(...\n8. ...1+3*(...\n9. ...1+3*(...\n10. ...1+3))\n\nWait, so starting from the outermost, the first layer is 3*(1+3*(...)), then each inner layer adds another 1+3*. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3*( occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside that, 1+3, which is the first innermost layer, then each subsequent 1+3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen layer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 1 is 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2 is 1+3*(layer1)=1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3=1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4=1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5=1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6=1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7=1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8=1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first innermost layer, which I called layer1: 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each time adding a layer. So, the expression has 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, layer1 is 4, layer2 is 13, up to layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check the calculations again for each layer.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 +5*100 +2*10 +4.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+72=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outwards.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outwards. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\).\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost 9 layers, we get the result 29524. The entire expression is then:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me check: The expression is 1 + 3(...). So, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(result of innermost). \n\nSo, the innermost was 4, so the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that. 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer is 40.\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward.

The original expression has multiple layers, each time with 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the problem again: It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: \n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), and each time there's another (1 + 3(...)).

So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, and moving outward, each time another layer is added. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer.

Let me check 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct, but maybe I should verify with another method or see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer9 result I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems to confirm the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that adds up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute 29524 * 3 by standard multiplication:\n\n   29524\nx      3\n--------\n   88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost as layer1, then layer2, up to layer9, and then multiply by 3.\n\n1. Layer1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way outwards, it'll be easier. So, let me write it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: $1+3$. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another 1 plus 3 times that result. Wait, no, let me check. The next level is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. So, actually, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result.\n\nWait, maybe I should label each step to keep track. Let's say each level is a term, starting from the innermost as level 1. So:\n\nLevel 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nThen, moving out, Level 2 would be $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 1}$. So that's $1 + 3 \\times 4$. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Level 2 is 13.\n\nLevel 3: Similarly, it would be $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 2}$. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's see: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Level 3 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40$. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Level 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: $1 + 3 \\times 121$. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Level 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: $1 + 3 \\times 364$. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Level 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: $1 + 3 \\times 1093$. Hmm, 3*1093. Let me calculate that: 1093*3. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280. Level 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: $1 + 3 \\times 3280$. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, plus 1 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841$. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. Level 9 is 29524.\n\nLevel 10: Finally, the outermost level is $3 \\times \\text{Level 9}$. So, 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, Level 10 is 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a very large number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each level again to make sure.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nLevel 10: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct, but let me verify 29524*3 again.\n\n29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of levels. The original expression is: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3(...) parts: Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is level 1.\n\nThen each time we add another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another level. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" after the first 3.\n\nFrom the innermost, we have 1+3, then each next is 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have one more level. Let me count the number of 3s inside:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each time we have another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, but the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many levels do we have?\n\nLet's see, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we add another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: each \")))\" corresponds to a level. So, the expression ends with nine closing parentheses: \")))))))))\". So, that would mean there are nine levels inside the first 3(...). Wait, but when I counted earlier, I had 9 levels, from level 1 to level 9, each being a deeper level. Then the outermost 3 multiplies level 9, making it level 10.\n\nWait, so perhaps I have 9 levels inside, and then the outermost 3, making it 10 layers. But in my initial counting, I considered level 1 as the innermost, so up to level 9, then the outermost is level 10. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify the number of closing parentheses to be sure. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many closing parentheses at the end? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\n- After the first 3(...), we have \")))\". So, each time we have a \")))\" at the end. Let me count them:\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" adds one more closing parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, each step adds one more closing parenthesis. Let's count from the end:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the end, we have:\n\n- The innermost part is 1+3, then each subsequent part adds another closing parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nAfter the innermost 1+3, we have one closing parenthesis. Then, each time we go out one level, we add another closing parenthesis. So, how many closing parentheses are there in total after the first 3(...)? Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nFrom the end, it's ...))))))))) So, let me count the number of closing parentheses at the very end. Each \")))\" is three closing parentheses, but in the expression, it's actually each \"1+3(...)\" adds one more closing parenthesis. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have \"1+3(\" except for the innermost which is just \"1+3\". So, let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me remove the outer 3(...) for a moment and focus on the inner part: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside this, the innermost is 1+3, then each next is 1+3(...). So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur inside?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds an opening parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, but the original expression is only up to 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, that's 9 levels inside the first 3(...). So, that would mean that we have 9 levels inside, making the total levels 10 when counting from the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had level 1 as the innermost, level 2 as the next, up to level 9, and then the outermost 3 would be level 10. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if I have 9 levels inside. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" inside the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds another level. So, the expression inside the first 3(...) is:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in this part:\n\n- The first 1+3 is level 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent 1+3( adds another level. So, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 levels inside, meaning that when we include the outermost 3(...), it's 10 levels in total. Therefore, my initial calculation up to level 10 is correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed level 9 as 29524, and then level 10 as 3*29524 = 88572, that seems correct. So, is 88572 the final answer? Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nLet me go through each level again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093 again. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nLevel 10: 3*29524. Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after double-checking, it seems that my calculations are correct, and the final answer is indeed 88572. Hmm, that's a pretty big number, but considering the depth of nesting, it makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each level step by step. Let me think about that. Each level is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous level}$. So, starting from level 1 as 4, each subsequent level is $1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous}$. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nIf I denote the nth level as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nn=10: Wait, no, because the outermost level is 3*a_9, which is 3*(29524)=88572. So, the formula gives a_9=29524, which is correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, we can compute a_9 as (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the outermost level is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to express the entire expression in terms of the formula, we could note that the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th term in the sequence. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which might be faster and less error-prone for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only had 9 levels inside, and 10 levels in total, it's manageable to compute step by step, but it's good to know that the formula exists.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level follows the pattern of $1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous level}$. By calculating each level step by step, we find that the value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try to map this out step by step.\n\nLet's number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost as levels 1 through 9. So, level 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and level 9 is the outermost one.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) + 1. Wait, no, actually, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1). Let me correct that.\n\nSo, Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to Level 9, which is 29524, we then multiply by 3. \n\nWait, no, actually, let me check the original problem again. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3*(Level 9). So, after computing Level 9, which is 29524, the final step is to multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my previous step-by-step, I thought Level 9 was the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps I miscounted the levels. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that each time I compute a level, I'm moving one step out, so the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9). So, maybe I should compute Level 9 as the innermost (1 + 3), then each subsequent level adds another layer, and finally, the outermost is 3*(Level 9). Let me try that again.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach was a bit off. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's 4.\n\nThen, moving outwards, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list them as layers 1 through 9, where layer 1 is the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final result is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000.\n\nThen, 3 * 9000 = 27000.\n\n3 * 500 = 1500.\n\n3 * 24 = 72.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but 29524 is actually 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute 3 * 29524 directly.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute digit by digit.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that with another method.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but earlier I thought that the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems to be the answer.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of (1 + 3*(...)), there are 9 layers inside, right? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent 1 + 3*(...) adds another layer. So, the total number of layers is 9. So, yes, I computed up to Layer 9, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Let's say I have a simpler version: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). How would that compute?\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the approach works for a smaller case.\n\nTherefore, applying the same method to the original problem, we get 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next level and compute:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. It seems like there are nine sets of parentheses, so maybe I should start from the innermost one and work my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions. Let me count them to be sure. Starting from the inside: \n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let's count the opening parentheses. Hmm, I think there are nine sets. So, I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me write down each step as I go along. Maybe that will help me keep track. I'll start with the innermost part and move outward.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost part becomes 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another set of parentheses around that. So, the next layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Wait, no, let me check the original problem again. It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (...)), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by the next layer). \n\nWait, maybe I should represent each layer as a step. Let me label each layer from inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, hold on, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + the next layer). So starting from the inside, Layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1). Then Layer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Wait, but the original problem seems to have nine layers because each time you add another (1+3(...)), so maybe I should start from the innermost and go outwards, computing each step.\n\nWait, maybe I should number the layers correctly. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nInnermost Layer (Layer 1): (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so each time, we compute the inner part first, then multiply by 3. So let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me confirm.\n\nWait, maybe I should index the layers from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression seems to have nine layers, so Layer 9 would be the outermost, which would be the entire expression. So the final result would be 36084. Hmm, but let me verify this step by step because I might have made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the original expression. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the innermost, each additional layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside the first parentheses, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s after each opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count how many times 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, if there are nine layers, then after computing each layer, the result would be as I calculated above.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could give me the same result without computing each layer manually.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let me see.\n\nGiven that a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), and a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15\n\na_3 = 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48\n\na_4 = 3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147\n\na_5 = 3 + 3*147 = 3 + 441 = 444\n\na_6 = 3 + 3*444 = 3 + 1332 = 1335\n\na_7 = 3 + 3*1335 = 3 + 4005 = 4008\n\na_8 = 3 + 3*4008 = 3 + 12024 = 12027\n\na_9 = 3 + 3*12027 = 3 + 36081 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the formula seems to hold.\n\nAlternatively, the general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3A => (8/2 + 3/2) = 11/2 = 3A => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: 11/6 * 3^n = 11 * 3^{n-1}, so a_n = 11*3^{n-1} - 3/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = 11*3^{9-1} - 3/2 = 11*3^8 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = 11*6561 - 3/2 = 72171 - 1.5 = 72169.5.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I computed step by step, a_9 was 36084, which is an integer, but this formula is giving me 72169.5, which is a fraction. That means I must have made a mistake in deriving the general formula.\n\nWait, let me check the particular solution again. The nonhomogeneous term is 3, so I assumed a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3 => C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. That seems correct.\n\nThen, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5/3 = 11/6. So, that's correct.\n\nThus, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWait, but when I plug in n=9, I get (11/6)*6561 - 3/2. Let me compute that again.\n\n(11/6)*6561: 6561 divided by 6 is 1093.5, then multiplied by 11: 1093.5*11 = let's compute 1000*11=11000, 93.5*11=1028.5, so total is 11000 + 1028.5 = 12028.5. Then subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: 12028.5 - 1.5 = 12027.\n\nWait, that's a_9 = 12027. But earlier, when I computed step by step, I had a_9 as 36084. Hmm, that's a problem. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the recurrence. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, a_1 is the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 15, a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 48, etc., up to a_9.\n\nBut according to the formula I derived, a_9 = 12027, but according to the step-by-step computation, a_9 was 36084. So, clearly, there's a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the initial condition. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n is defined as starting from n=1, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, a_2 is 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is correct.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9 = 12027, but in my step-by-step, I had a_9 as 36084. That suggests that perhaps the formula is correct, but I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem has more than nine layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"3(\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+3(...). Let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, but the expression ends with nine closing parentheses, so perhaps there are nine layers. So, if a_9 is 12027 according to the formula, but in my step-by-step, I had a_9 as 36084, that suggests that perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, no, in my step-by-step, I went up to a_9 as 36084, but according to the formula, a_9 is 12027. That suggests that perhaps the formula is for a different starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula's initial condition. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nBut in the step-by-step, a_2 = 15, a_3 = 48, etc.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_2 = 3*a_1 + 3 = 3*4 + 3 = 15, which is correct.\n\na_3 = 3*a_2 + 3 = 3*15 + 3 = 48, correct.\n\na_4 = 3*48 + 3 = 147, correct.\n\na_5 = 3*147 + 3 = 444, correct.\n\na_6 = 3*444 + 3 = 1335, correct.\n\na_7 = 3*1335 + 3 = 4008, correct.\n\na_8 = 3*4008 + 3 = 12027, correct.\n\na_9 = 3*12027 + 3 = 36084, correct.\n\nWait, so in the formula, when n=9, a_9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step. Earlier, when I used the formula a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2, I got a_9 = 12027, which is incorrect. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the general solution.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the general solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 3 => K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWait, but when n=9, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683: 19683 / 6 = 3280.5; 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280*11=36080, and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 (which is 1.5): 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nAh, there we go! So, a_9 = 36084, which matches my step-by-step calculation. I must have made a mistake earlier when computing 3^8 instead of 3^9.\n\nSo, the formula is correct, and the final result is 36084.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I can confidently say that the result is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the result of the next layer). After computing each step, the final result is found to be 36084.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 3 * (1 + 4) = 15\n   - Layer 3: 3 * (1 + 15) = 48\n   - Layer 4: 3 * (1 + 48) = 147\n   - Layer 5: 3 * (1 + 147) = 444\n   - Layer 6: 3 * (1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Layer 7: 3 * (1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Layer 8: 3 * (1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - Layer 9: 3 * (1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of parentheses, each containing a similar structure: 3 times something in parentheses. It looks like a nested expression where each inner part is another multiplication and addition. So, maybe the way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order in which operations should be performed, so starting from the inside seems logical.\n\nLet me try to write this out step by step. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be (1 + 3*(previous result)). Wait, let me check that.\n\nLooking at the original expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, starting from the innermost, it's (1+3). Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(the result of the inner layer). So, each time, I have a 1 plus 3 times the previous value. Let me confirm that structure.\n\nSo, if I denote each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- And so on, until Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of parentheses. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression, I can see that after the first 3, there are 9 layers of parentheses. Each layer is of the form (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps there are 9 layers, meaning we need to compute 9 times. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(something). So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer and compute the value step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nThen, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nAnd 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That matches my earlier calculation, so that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step is 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the value after 9 layers is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually is manageable, though a bit time-consuming.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\n3. Do this 9 times, each time getting a new value.\n\n4. After the 9th layer, you get 29524.\n\n5. Multiply this by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nTotal expression = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nEither way, the result is the same.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the inside out. That usually works with parentheses. So, starting from the innermost part, let's see.\n\nThe innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me calculate that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so now that part simplifies to 13.\n\nNext layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*(13). Let's see, 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so that layer becomes 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute 3*121 first. 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Adding 1 gives us 364. So, that layer simplifies to 364.\n\nNext up, we have 1 + 3*(364). Let me calculate 3*364. Well, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives us 9841. So, that layer is 9841.\n\nNext, we have 1 + 3*(9841). Let me calculate 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again because that seems like a big number. 3*9841: Let me compute it another way. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives us 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 29524 * 3: \n\n- 29524\n- Multiply by 3:\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- 5*3=15, wait, no, 29524 is 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, actually, the digits are 2,9,5,2,4 from left to right. So, let's do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nSo, the result is 88572, then adding 1 gives 88573. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute that. First, 3*88573. Let me calculate that. 88573 * 3: \n\nLet's break it down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives us 265720. So, that layer is 265720.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 88573 *3:\n\n- 3*3=9\n- 3*7=21, write down 1, carryover 2.\n- 3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n- 3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n- 3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2.\n- 3*0=0 +2=2, but wait, the number is 88573, so no more digits after 8. Wait, no, 88573 is 8,8,5,7,3. So, from the right:\n\n- 3*3=9\n- 3*7=21, write 1, carryover 2\n- 3*5=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1\n- 3*8=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2\n- 3*8=24 +2=26, write 6, carryover 2\n- 3*0=0 +2=2, but there are no more digits, so write 2.\n\nWait, but 88573 is a 5-digit number, so when we multiply by 3, we should get a 6-digit number starting with 2, then 6, then 5, then 7, then 1, then 9. Wait, let's do it step by step:\n\n88573\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carryover 2\nSince there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, the result is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3*(265720). Let's compute that. First, 3*265720. Hmm, 265720*3. Let me compute that:\n\n265720 \u00d7 3:\n- 200000 \u00d7 3 = 600000\n- 60000 \u00d7 3 = 180000\n- 5000 \u00d7 3 = 15000\n- 700 \u00d7 3 = 2100\n- 20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n- 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n\nWait, that's not the correct breakdown. Wait, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20. So:\n\n200000 \u00d73 = 600000\n60000 \u00d73 = 180000\n5000 \u00d73 = 15000\n700 \u00d73 = 2100\n20 \u00d73 = 60\nAdding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, +15000 = 795000, +2100 = 797100, +60 = 797160.\n\nSo, 3*265720 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives us 797161. So, that layer is 797161.\n\nWait, let me confirm that multiplication. 265720 \u00d73:\n\n- 265720\n\u00d7        3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n0 \u00d73=0\n2 \u00d73=6\n7 \u00d73=21, write 1, carryover 2\n5 \u00d73=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1\n6 \u00d73=18 +1=19, write 9, carryover 1\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7\n\nSo, writing it out: 797160. Then adding 1 gives 797161.\n\nFinally, the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, 3*(797161). Let me compute that.\n\n3 \u00d7797161:\n\nLet me break it down:\n700000 \u00d73 = 2,100,000\n90,000 \u00d73 = 270,000\n7,000 \u00d73 = 21,000\n100 \u00d73 = 300\n60 \u00d73 = 180\n1 \u00d73 = 3\n\nWait, actually, 797161 is 700,000 + 90,000 + 7,000 + 100 + 60 +1.\n\nSo, 700,000 \u00d73=2,100,000\n90,000 \u00d73=270,000\n7,000 \u00d73=21,000\n100 \u00d73=300\n60 \u00d73=180\n1 \u00d73=3\n\nAdding those together:\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n2,391,480 +3 = 2,391,483\n\nSo, 3\u00d7797161=2,391,483.\n\nWait, let me check that again using another method:\n\n797161 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n1\u00d73=3\n6\u00d73=18, write 8, carryover 1\n1\u00d73=3 +1=4\n7\u00d73=21, write 1, carryover 2\n9\u00d73=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2\n7\u00d73=21 +2=23, write 3, carryover 2\n(No more digits, so write the carryover 2)\n\nWait, that would give 2391483. But that's 2,391,483, which matches the previous calculation. So, 3\u00d7797161=2,391,483.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each layer simplifies as follows:\n\nInnermost: (1+3)=4\n\nNext: 1 +3\u00d74=13\n\nNext: 1 +3\u00d713=40\n\nNext:1 +3\u00d740=121\n\nNext:1 +3\u00d7121=364\n\nNext:1 +3\u00d7364=1093\n\nNext:1 +3\u00d71093=3280\n\nNext:1 +3\u00d73280=9841\n\nNext:1 +3\u00d79841=29524\n\nNext:1 +3\u00d729524=88573\n\nNext:1 +3\u00d788573=265720\n\nNext:1 +3\u00d7265720=797161\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3\u00d7797161=2,391,483.\n\nWait, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Next: 1+3\u00d74=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. Next:1+3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. Next:1+3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. Next:1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. Next:1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. Next:1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. Next:1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. Next:1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. Next:1+3\u00d729524=1+88572=88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n11. Next:1+3\u00d788573=1+265719=265720 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n12. Next:1+3\u00d7265720=1+797160=797161 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n13. Finally:3\u00d7797161=2,391,483 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps check out. So, the final result is 2,391,483.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each step followed logically from the previous one, and I double-checked each multiplication to ensure accuracy. So, yeah, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that simplifies step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Repeating this process for each layer ultimately results in the final value.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Substitute back into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. Continue substituting and simplifying each layer:  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\\)\n\n4. Finally, multiply the outermost result by 3:  \n   \\(3 \\times 797161 = 2391483\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{2391483}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that it's a nested expression, meaning each part inside the parentheses depends on the result of the inner parentheses. So, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nHmm, okay. So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). Wait, no, actually, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, moving out one level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, so that part becomes 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, so that becomes 40. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, perhaps I can model this as a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try to define it more formally. Let's denote each level as a_n, where n is the level number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 is the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). Then, a_2 is 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 is 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, until a_9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of parentheses to make sure. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so each level adds another set. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nWait, let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. From the original expression, each \"1+3(\" is a new level. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1+3(...)), so let's count how many times 1+3 occurs:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. The outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is the 9th one, I think. Let me check: Each time, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, in the given expression, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with 9 levels. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, we can model this as a sequence with 9 terms.\n\nSo, let's define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(a_9). So, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me see: The outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then each a_i is 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, so a_9 would be the value after 9 iterations. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 innermost (1 + 3). So, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a_9 = 29524, so the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems quite large. Let me check my a_9 calculation again, maybe I made a mistake in the sequence.\n\nWait, let me recalculate each a_i step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, a_9 is indeed 29524, and 3*a_9 is 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems correct, but let me check if I have 9 levels. Let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*a formula.\n\nStarting from a_1 to a_9, that's 9 steps. So, yes, the innermost is a_1, and each step adds another layer, so the outermost is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 innermost (1 + 3). So, yes, a_9 would be the innermost 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*a_previous, so a_9 is the value after 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses before the first closing parenthesis. Wait, no, actually, let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, a_1 to a_9.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Maybe using a formula for such a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence relation here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive pattern, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is just $1+3$. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost expression: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nOkay, so that simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 3 multiplied by this result. Let me write that next step:\n\nNext layer: $3 \\times 4 = 12$\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the structure, each layer is of the form $3(1 + ... )$. So, perhaps I should be substituting the innermost expression first and then working my way out. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me label each layer from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9, since there are nine layers of 3(...). Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nLayer 2: $3 \\times (1 + 3) = 3 \\times 4 = 12$\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because each layer is actually $3(1 + ... )$, so it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, maybe I should think of each step as:\n\nAt each layer, compute the inner expression first, then multiply by 3 and add 1? Or is it multiplied by 3? Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by ... )). So, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: $1 + 3$, then Layer 8 is $3*(1 + Layer9)$, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 9: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nLayer 8: $3 \\times (1 + Layer9) = 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15$\n\nWait, but hold on, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, Layer 8 would be 3*(1 + Layer9). Since Layer9 is 4, then Layer8 is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, Layer7 would be 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last 1+3, that's Layer1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen moving outwards, each time we have 3*(1 + previous layer). So Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to confirm. Starting from the left:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3*(... Layer9\n2. 3*(... Layer8\n3. 3*(... Layer7\n4. 3*(... Layer6\n5. 3*(... Layer5\n6. 3*(... Layer4\n7. 3*(... Layer3\n8. 3*(... Layer2\n9. 3*(... Layer1\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is Layer1, which is 1+3=4, then Layer2 is 3*(1 + 4)=15, Layer3 is 3*(1 + 15)=48, and so on until Layer9, which is the outermost. But in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so the total number of layers is 9, starting from Layer1 to Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I started, I thought Layer9 was the innermost, but perhaps I should label them from the outermost as Layer1 to Layer9. Hmm, maybe I confused the numbering. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, in nested expressions, the innermost is the deepest layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last 1+3, let's call that Layer1. Then each layer moving outwards is Layer2, Layer3, etc., up to Layer9 being the outermost expression.\n\nSo, Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, the outermost expression, which is Layer9, equals 36,084.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12,027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each step, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 3, because it's 3*(1 + previous). Wait, actually, no, it's 3*(1 + previous). So, it's 3*1 + 3*previous, which is 3 + 3*previous. So, each layer is 3 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if that's the case.\n\nFor example, Layer2: 3 + 3*Layer1 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 3 + 3*Layer2 = 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 3 + 3*Layer3 = 3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works too. So, another way to compute each layer is to take 3 plus three times the previous layer. That might be a quicker way to compute it mentally.\n\nSo, starting from Layer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 3 + 3*4 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3 + 3*15 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3 + 3*48 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3 + 3*147 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3 + 3*444 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3 + 3*1335 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3 + 3*4008 = 12,027\n\nLayer9: 3 + 3*12,027 = 36,084\n\nSame result. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, if I denote the entire expression as S, then S = 3*(1 + S'), where S' is the next inner expression. But since all the expressions are similar, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nWait, but in this case, the expressions are finite, so it's a finite nested multiplication. So, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, for n > 1, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, with a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12,027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the final value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute it all again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12,027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084\n\nYep, that's consistent. I think I can be confident that the result is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write this as a formula, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 3\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 3 => -2*a_p = 3 => a_p = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A => 11/2 = 3A => A = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 3:\n\na_n = 3*(11/6)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for n=9,\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216,513 - 9)/6 = 216,504/6 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches our earlier result. Therefore, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer: 36,084.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both the iterative approach and the recurrence relation method, even deriving a closed-form formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (Layer 9):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

Let me compute that first. \n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. Innermost: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have $1 + 3(\\text{previous result})$. So, replacing the innermost part with 4, the next layer becomes:\n\n2. Next layer: $1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\nOkay, so that's 13.

The original expression has multiple layers, but how many exactly? Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears. Starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer adds another set. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each layer out adds another (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses.

Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the initial expression is 3 multiplied by a big parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, it's 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis, and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, we have (1 + 3(...)), where ... is the previous layer.\n3. Repeating this, each time we go out a layer, we add another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's see, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1.

So, starting from layer 1 as (1 + 3), layer 2 is (1 + 3(layer1)), layer3 is (1 + 3(layer2)), and so on up to layer9, which is the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the initial expression is 3 multiplied by (layer9). So, the total number of layers is 9. So, I need to compute layer1 through layer9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (layer1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (layer3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (layer4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (layer5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (layer6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (layer7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (layer8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (layer9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by layer9, which is 29524. So, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, earlier I thought the layers went up to 9, but when I started computing, I went up to 9 layers, but when I multiplied by 3 at the end, I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The initial expression is 3 multiplied by (layer9). So, layer9 is 29524, so 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, the outermost is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me write down the layers with their corresponding results:\n\n1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers. Let me go through each step again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. 363 +1 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct up to layer9: 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be absolutely sure.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and I've double-checked each step. So, I'm confident that the result is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of multiplications and additions.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like a recursive kind of structure, where each part depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nI count nine sets of parentheses here. Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3( result from step 1 ))\n3. Then: (1 + 3( result from step 2 ))\n...\n9. Outermost: 3(1 + 3( result from step 8 ))\n\nWait, actually, since each step is inside another, maybe I should work from the innermost outwards, computing each layer one by one. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3)\nThat's simple: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nStep 2: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 1))\nSo, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that:\n3*4 = 12\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, moving out another layer:\n\nStep 3: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 2))\nWhich is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that:\n3*13 = 39\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, I see a pattern forming here. Each step, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then proceeding. Let me try to see if this pattern continues.\n\nStep 4: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 3))\nSo, 1 + 3*40. Calculating:\n3*40 = 120\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 4))\n1 + 3*121. Let's do that:\n3*121 = 363\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 5))\n1 + 3*364. Calculating:\n3*364 = 1092\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 6))\n1 + 3*1093. Let's see:\n3*1093 = 3279\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 7))\n1 + 3*3280. Calculating:\n3*3280 = 9840\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 8))\n1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that:\n3*9841 = 29523\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, the outermost operation is:\n\n3*(result from Step 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n3*29524 = ?\n\nWell, let's break it down:\n29524 * 3\n= (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3)\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\nNow, adding those together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to get lost in so many steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks like all the steps check out. Each time, I multiplied by 3 and added 1 correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 also seems right. I don't see any arithmetic errors here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is a repeated application of the operation: 1 + 3*(...). So, it's like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each step as a term in a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3, then a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082, and so on up to a\u2089. Then, the final result is 3*a\u2089.\n\nSo, starting with a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWhich is exactly what I did before. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099 to avoid computing each term step by step.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a\u2099 = r*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + c, where r is the multiplier and c is the constant. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is given by:\n\na\u2099 = (a\u2081 - c/(1 - r)) * r^(n - 1) + c/(1 - r)\n\nWait, let me make sure I recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a\u2099 = r*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + c, the closed-form solution is:\n\na\u2099 = r^(n - 1)*(a\u2081 - c/(1 - r)) + c/(1 - r)\n\nBut wait, this is only valid when r \u2260 1. Since r = 3 here, that's fine.\n\nLet me compute c/(1 - r):\n\nc = 1, r = 3, so c/(1 - r) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2\n\nThen, a\u2081 - c/(1 - r) = 4 - (-1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\na\u2099 = (9/2)*3^(n - 1) - 1/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n = 1:\n\na\u2081 = (9/2)*3^(0) - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 2:\n\na\u2082 = (9/2)*3^(1) - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 3:\n\na\u2083 = (9/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works for the first few terms. So, in general, a\u2099 = (9/2)*3^(n - 1) - 1/2.\n\nSince our problem goes up to a\u2089, let's compute a\u2089 using this formula:\n\na\u2089 = (9/2)*3^(8) - 1/2\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2\n\nCompute (9/2)*6561:\n\nFirst, 6561 * 9 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6561 * 9:\n\n6000*9 = 54000\n\n500*9 = 4500\n\n60*9 = 540\n\n1*9 = 9\n\nAdding up: 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049\n\nSo, 6561 * 9 = 59049\n\nThen, (9/2)*6561 = 59049 / 2 = 29524.5\n\nNow, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524\n\nSo, a\u2089 = 29524, which matches the result I got earlier. So, the formula works perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated step by step before.\n\nI guess the key takeaway here is recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation and then using the formula to find the nth term without computing each step manually. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. If it had more layers, the formula would definitely save a lot of time.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time, we're essentially building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Maybe not necessary, since the recurrence relation worked fine.\n\nIn summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or using the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Compute $(1 + 3 \\times 29524)$:\n    - Multiply: $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n    - Add 1: $1 + 88572 = 88573$\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that last multiplication correctly. 3 times 29524. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n- 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n- 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n- 24 \u00d7 3 = 72\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNow, the outermost part is 3 multiplied by this result. Let's compute that.\n\n11. Compute $3 \\times 88573$:\n    - Let's break it down: 80000 \u00d7 3 = 240000\n    - 8000 \u00d7 3 = 24000\n    - 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n    - 70 \u00d7 3 = 210\n    - 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n    Adding them up:\n    240000 + 24000 = 264000\n    264000 + 1500 = 265500\n    265500 + 210 = 265710\n    265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down.\n\nAlternatively, just compute 88573 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 80000 \u00d7 3 = 240000\n- 8000 \u00d7 3 = 24000\n- 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n- 70 \u00d7 3 = 210\n- 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\nAdding these together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000; 264000 + 1500 = 265500; 265500 + 210 = 265710; 265710 + 9 = 265719.\n\nWait, but 88573 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it another way to verify.\n\nCompute 88573 \u00d7 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (units place)\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, carry over 2\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26\n\nSo writing it down: 265719. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 265719.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my steps because this seems like a lot, and it's easy to make a mistake in one of the multiplications or additions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3\u00d74) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3\u00d713) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3\u00d740) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3\u00d7121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3\u00d7364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3\u00d71093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3\u00d73280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3\u00d79841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. (1 + 3\u00d729524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. 3\u00d788573 = 265719\n\nEach step seems correct. Let me check a couple of the intermediate steps again to be sure.\n\nFor example, step 6: (1 + 3\u00d7364). 3\u00d7364: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12; 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3\u00d71093). 3\u00d71000=3000, 3\u00d793=279; 3000+279=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3\u00d73280). 3\u00d73000=9000, 3\u00d7280=840; 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3\u00d79841). 3\u00d79000=27000, 3\u00d7841=2523; 27000+2523=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: (1 + 3\u00d729524). 3\u00d729000=87000, 3\u00d7524=1572; 87000+1572=88572. 1+88572=88573. Correct.\n\nStep 11: 3\u00d788573. As above, 265719. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the result is indeed 265719. I don't see any errors in my calculations. It was a bit tedious, but taking it one step at a time helped prevent mistakes.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is recognizing that each step is a geometric series or something, but since it's only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually isn't too bad. If it were deeper, maybe a formula would be better, but for 9 layers, step-by-step is manageable.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute one of the steps using a different method to cross-verify. Let's pick step 5: (1 + 3\u00d7121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Alternatively, 3\u00d7121: 120\u00d73=360, 1\u00d73=3, so 360+3=363. 363+1=364. Correct.\n\nAnother one: step 3: (1 + 3\u00d740) = 1 + 120 = 121. 3\u00d740=120, 120+1=121. Correct.\n\nAlright, I think I'm solid here. Each step checks out, so the final answer should be 265719.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each level involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward step by step, we compute each level's value until we reach the final result.\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n10. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 88573\\)\n11. Outermost: \\(3 \\times 88573 = 265719\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{265719}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that it's a nested expression with multiple layers. Each layer seems to be of the form 3 multiplied by something in parentheses, and that something in parentheses is 1 plus another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of operations. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order of operations, so starting from the inside would be logical.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside, I can build up the solution.\n\nLet me list out each layer for clarity:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n10. Finally, multiply the result by 3.\n\nSo, there are nine layers in total, each one building on the previous. Let me start computing each step one by one.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost layer**\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward.\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n**Step 2: Next layer**\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). Since Step 1 gave us 4, this becomes:\n1 + 3*4\nFirst, compute 3*4, which is 12.\nThen, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\n**Step 3: Next layer**\nMoving outward again, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). Step 2 gave us 13, so:\n1 + 3*13\nCompute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39\nThen add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\n**Step 4: Next layer**\nNow, 1 + 3*(result from Step 3). Step 3 result is 40.\nSo, 1 + 3*40\nCompute 3*40: 120\nAdd 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n\n**Step 5: Next layer**\nNext layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 4). Step 4 was 121.\nSo, 1 + 3*121\nCompute 3*121: Let me think, 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363.\nAdd 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\n**Step 6: Next layer**\nMoving outward, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 5). Step 5 result is 364.\nSo, 1 + 3*364\nCompute 3*364: Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092\nAdd 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n**Step 7: Next layer**\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 6). Step 6 gave us 1093.\nSo, 1 + 3*1093\nCompute 3*1093: Let me break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279\nAdd 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n**Step 8: Next layer**\nNow, 1 + 3*(result from Step 7). Step 7 result is 3280.\nSo, 1 + 3*3280\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840\nAdd 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n**Step 9: Next layer**\nMoving outward, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 8). Step 8 gave us 9841.\nSo, 1 + 3*9841\nCompute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523\nAdd 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n**Step 10: Final layer**\nNow, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result from Step 9. Step 9 gave us 29524.\nSo, 3*29524\nLet me compute this:\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\nWait, actually, let me do it properly:\n29524 * 3\nBreak it down digit by digit:\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\nSo, putting it all together: 88572\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the breakdown.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let me verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 30000*3=90000, so 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476*3).\n\nCompute 476*3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200+210=1410 +18=1428.\n\nSo, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps because that would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me recount the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. Final: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEach step seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might help verify the result.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication and addition. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with recursion.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, this confirms the step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each step. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this method also leads to the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, since each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, and the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing step by step, using the recursive formula, or applying the closed-form expression\u2014we arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think this thorough step-by-step approach, along with verifying using a formula, ensures that the answer is correct. It's easy to make a multiplication error when dealing with large numbers, but by breaking it down and cross-verifying, I can be confident that 88572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. This process is repeated outward until the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{88572}."

Next: (1 + 3a\u2081) = a\u2082\n3. Then: (1 + 3a\u2082) = a\u2083\n4. Next: (1 + 3a\u2083) = a\u2084\n5. Then: (1 + 3a\u2084) = a\u2085\n6. Next: (1 + 3a\u2085) = a\u2086\n7. Then: (1 + 3a\u2086) = a\u2087\n8. Next: (1 + 3a\u2087) = a\u2088\n9. Then: (1 + 3a\u2088) = a\u2089\n\nSo, there are nine layers, each building on the previous one. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a\u2089. So, the total expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nOkay, so now I can compute each a\u2081 through a\u2089 step by step. Let me start computing each term one by one.\n\nStarting with a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to a\u2082:\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12\n\nThen add 1: 12 + 1 = 13\n\nSo, a\u2082 = 13\n\nNext, a\u2083:\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n\nAdd 1: 39 + 1 = 40\n\nSo, a\u2083 = 40\n\nMoving on to a\u2084:\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 3*40 = 120\n\nAdd 1: 120 + 1 = 121\n\nSo, a\u2084 = 121\n\nNow, a\u2085:\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: Let's see, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363\n\nAdd 1: 363 + 1 = 364\n\nSo, a\u2085 = 364\n\nNext, a\u2086:\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's break it down. 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nAdd 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093\n\nSo, a\u2086 = 1093\n\nMoving on to a\u2087:\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's do 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nAdd 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280\n\nSo, a\u2087 = 3280\n\nNext, a\u2088:\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: Let's break it down. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nAdd 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841\n\nSo, a\u2088 = 9841\n\nFinally, a\u2089:\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's see. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nAdd 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524\n\nSo, a\u2089 = 29524\n\nNow, remember that the entire expression is 3 times a\u2089, so:\n\nTotal expression = 3 * a\u2089 = 3 * 29524\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Let me compute each part:\n\n20000*3 = 60,000\n\n9000*3 = 27,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the total expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that. Sometimes when I break down numbers, I might make a mistake in the addition. Let me check the multiplication another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572. Yep, that matches my previous result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, and then subtract the difference. Wait, 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That also checks out. So, I'm confident that 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing a\u2089, let me go back and check each step again.\n\nStarting from a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Then, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a\u2089 another way, perhaps using a different approach, like recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the sequence a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2089, each term is defined by a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081\n\nAssume solution a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3\u207f + B = 1 + 3*(A*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + 3*B = 1 + A*3\u207f + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3\u207f + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3\u207f + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3\u207f + B = 1 + A*3\u207f + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3\u207f from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, to find A, use the initial condition. Let's use a\u2081 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a\u2081 = A*3\u00b9 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nWe know B = -1/2, so:\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nSo, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na\u2081 = (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na\u2082 = (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na\u2083 = (3\u2074 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2\n\nCompute 3\u00b9\u2070:\n\n3\u00b9 = 3\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n3\u00b3 =27\n\n3\u2074=81\n\n3\u2075=243\n\n3\u2076=729\n\n3\u2077=2187\n\n3\u2078=6561\n\n3\u2079=19683\n\n3\u00b9\u2070=59049\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089=29524, and the total expression is 3*a\u2089=88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nI think that's solid. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so starting from the inside, I think I should work my way outwards because that's usually how nested parentheses work. So, let's count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1+3\" inside another set of parentheses, that's a new layer. Let me count them: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then that's inside another 1+3, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, I see nine opening parentheses before the first 1+3, so maybe there are nine layers? Wait, no, let me check again. \n\nWait, the problem is written as: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Let me see how many times the pattern 1+3(...) repeats. Let me try to parse it.\n\nLet me write it down more clearly, maybe that will help. So, the expression is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3 * (1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, let me check again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet's number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 through 9, maybe. Wait, let me see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer out adds another 3*(...). So, let me compute each step.\n\nStarting with layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that again because the problem has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let's see how many times we have 3(...). Let me count the number of 3's after the initial 3.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Let me think of each \"1 + 3(...)\" as a term. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer out is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have n layers, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write each layer as a step and compute them one by one.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so layer9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check if I have 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, the pattern is \"1+3(\".\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3(...), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3. Then each layer out adds another 1+3(...). So, let me see:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences.\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. ...1+3(...\n\n3. ...1+3(...\n\n4. ...1+3(...\n\n5. ...1+3(...\n\n6. ...1+3(...\n\n7. ...1+3(...\n\n8. ...1+3(...\n\n9. ...1+3(...\n\n10. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each time we have a \"1+3(...)\", it's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, right? So, after computing layer9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, looking at each layer, each time we have 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from layer1=4, layer2=13, layer3=40, layer4=121, layer5=364, layer6=1093, layer7=3280, layer8=9841, layer9=29524.\n\nWait, let me check if each step is correct.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me see the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps another way: Each time you have a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer, except the last one which is just \"1+3\".\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. So, starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...), so that's the first layer.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...), that's the second layer.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. ...1+3(...\n\n3. ...1+3(...\n\n4. ...1+3(...\n\n5. ...1+3(...\n\n6. ...1+3(...\n\n7. ...1+3(...\n\n8. ...1+3(...\n\n9. ...1+3(...\n\n10. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, now I'm confused because I'm counting 9 layers, but when I count the number of \"1+3(\" after the first 3, I might be getting 9. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- After the first 3, we have (1+3(...), so that's one opening parenthesis.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...), that's two.\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is (1+3). So, how many opening parentheses are there?\n\nLet me count them:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another opening parenthesis. So, the number of opening parentheses is 9, right? Because after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses before the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, let me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(\n\n2. Then another (1+3(\n\n3. Another (1+3(\n\n4. Another (1+3(\n\n5. Another (1+3(\n\n6. Another (1+3(\n\n7. Another (1+3(\n\n8. Another (1+3(\n\n9. Another (1+3(\n\n10. Then, the innermost is (1+3). Wait, no, that's the 9th opening parenthesis, right?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.\n\nIf I consider each \"1+3(\" as a new layer, then the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. So, in the expression, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first \"1+3(\" after 3 is layer1.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" is layer2.\n\n3. Continuing, layer3, layer4, layer5, layer6, layer7, layer8, layer9.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total, right? Because after the initial 3, there are 9 \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nTherefore, my earlier computation of layer9 being 29524, and then 3*29524=88572 seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my computation again because 3*29524 is 88572, but let me verify it another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute each layer and see if I made any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term.\n\nEach layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again because the initial term was a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to be absolutely sure.\n\nLet me try that again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo,\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after all these checks, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe result of the computation is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outwards.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the result of the computation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive structure, where each step depends on the previous one. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, each subsequent layer is 3 multiplied by the previous result plus 1. So, it's like a chain: starting from the inside, each step is 3*(previous result) + 1, and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nLet me try to parse it step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and move outward. \n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from first layer). Hmm, let me check that. Actually, looking again, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So maybe I need to define each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer starting from the innermost one as Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times this happens. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each time moving outward, we have another layer. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, it's another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers because each 1+3 is a new layer. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's (1 + 3(...)), so each of those is a new layer. So starting from the innermost, each layer adds another set of parentheses. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts. Starting from the first one after the initial 3, each subsequent one is another layer. So, let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost part.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3), which is Layer 1. Then each time moving outward, we have another layer. So, how many layers? Let's see, from the innermost to the outermost, how many times do we have (1 + 3(...))? Let me count: \n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1)\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, because the outermost is Layer 9, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3 again? Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(...), so maybe Layer 9 is the innermost, and then each time we go outward, it's another layer, up to Layer 9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 is Layer 10? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. So, let's define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: The next layer out is 3*(1 + result from Step1). So, that would be 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3)=4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16=48, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the given expression, the innermost is (1+3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + (1+3)), which is 3*(1 + 4)=15, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15)=3*16=48, and so on until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the given expression, the entire expression is 3*(...). So, perhaps after computing all the layers, we have to multiply the result by 3 again. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me structure it properly. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing up to L9, do I need to multiply by 3 again? Let me check the structure.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is L1 = 4, then L2 = 15, up to L9 = 36084, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, because L9 is already 3*(1 + L8), so the outermost multiplication by 3 is included in L9. So, perhaps I don't need to multiply by 3 again. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the first layer after the innermost is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nContinuing this way up to the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + ...), and then the entire expression is 3*(that result). Wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, each time applying 3*(1 + ...), and then the entire expression is just that 9th layer. So, perhaps the final result is L9 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check by actually computing each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me write down each step clearly.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, after computing up to Layer 9, the result is 36084. But wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is exactly Layer 9, so the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1+4)=3*5=15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1+15)=3*16=48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1+48)=3*49=147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1+147)=3*148=444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1+444)=3*445=1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1+1335)=3*1336=4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1+4008)=3*4009=12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1+12027)=3*12028=36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be expressed as a geometric series or using a recurrence relation.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined as L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) with L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nHmm, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 3 => A - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nLet me compute L9 using this formula.\n\nL9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, L9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280.5 * 10 = 32805, plus 3280.5 = 36085.5\n\nSo, L9 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nWhich matches our step-by-step calculation. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^9 again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 11/6 * 19683 = (11 * 19683) / 6.\n\nLet me compute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nAdding together: 196830 + 19683 = 216,513.\n\nNow, 216,513 \u00f7 6 = 36,085.5.\n\nThen subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: 36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our step-by-step approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the result from the previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 36,084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"
