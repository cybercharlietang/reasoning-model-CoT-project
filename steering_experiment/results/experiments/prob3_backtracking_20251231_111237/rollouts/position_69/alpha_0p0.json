    "text": " Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 (then another layer)\n\nSo, each time I add a layer, I have another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3 appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nContinuing this way, how many times? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each time we have a \"1+3(\" except the very first one. Wait, perhaps another approach: each time I have a \"1+3(\", it's a new layer. So, let's count how many \"1+3(\" are there.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 1+3 after the initial 3, each time there's a \"1+3(\", which is 9 times. Wait, let me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: 1+3(\n\n2. Then another 1+3(\n\n3. Then another 1+3(\n\n4. Then another 1+3(\n\n5. Then another 1+3(\n\n6. Then another 1+3(\n\n7. Then another 1+3(\n\n8. Then another 1+3(\n\n9. Then another 1+3(\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3, which is the 9th layer? Wait, no, because each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each time you have a \"1+3(\", it's a new layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then, each time you go out, you add another layer. So, the total number of layers is 9, as I initially thought.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps my initial computation is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me write down each step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression, I see that the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3, so the number of layers is 9, right? Because the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 sets of 1+3.\n\nYes, so 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*previous layer. So, my computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is of the form a_n = C*3^n + D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSo, left side: C*3^n + D = right side: 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the count can be tricky.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, starting from the innermost. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each time we have another \"1+3(\", so:\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nContinuing until we reach the outermost layer. How many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let's see:\n\nThe expression after the initial 3 is: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside this, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\n2. Then another \"1+3(\" inside that.\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is just 1+3, without another \"1+3(\" after that.\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\", and the innermost is just 1+3, which doesn't have another \"1+3(\" after it.\n\nSo, the number of \"1+3(\" is 9, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, n=9, and a_9=29524.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote L as the innermost layer, which is 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4=13, and so on. But I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that applies directly here because each term is dependent on the previous term multiplied by 3 and then adding 1.\n\nWait, but the formula I used earlier for the recurrence is a standard approach for linear recurrences of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, which in this case is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, using that method, I found the general solution, which gave me a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways now: computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, and even counting the layers to ensure I'm not making a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer once again, step by step, to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nYes, all the layers compute correctly, so I can be confident that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've thought through this problem thoroughly, checking each step and even using different methods to confirm the solution. It's a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be solved using recurrence relations or by simply computing each layer step by step.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: positions are ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units. So, 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, maybe I can compute it without having to go through each layer manually. Let's see if I can find a recursive formula or perhaps a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That seems similar to a geometric series, but with each term being scaled by 3 and then adding 1. But since each layer is dependent on the previous one, it's a linear recurrence as I solved earlier. Either way, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula both lead to the same result, so I think it's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without going through each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the layers. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series, perhaps. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly and then plug into the formula. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, yes, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this method also gives the same result, confirming that my initial step-by-step computation was correct.

Wait, but let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found using standard techniques. First, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. That might be more efficient if there are many layers, but in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. But it's good to know the pattern, in case the problem had more layers or was more complex. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution, I was able to compute the value efficiently. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also worked, though it was a bit more time-consuming. Either way, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step.

So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_p(n) = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I only had nine layers, it wasn't too bad to compute each step manually. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and setting up the recurrence relation can simplify the problem. I think that's a useful approach for similar nested expressions. So, in summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a recurrence pattern. Each layer follows the relation L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4. Using the closed-form formula for the nth layer, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find L(9) = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. Assuming a particular solution is a constant, let's say a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Starting from the innermost term, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the expression can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. But in this case, since we have a finite number of layers (9 layers), it's not an infinite series but rather a finite nested expression. So, the approach of solving the recurrence relation was appropriate here. Alternatively, if I had to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I would have had to compute each layer step by step, which I did initially, and it worked out correctly. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. In conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form solution, the final value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for a_1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = 2*3^{n} - 1. Let's test that. For a_1: 2*3^1 -1 = 6 -1 =5, which is not 4. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, maybe a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. Let's test that. For a_1: (3^{2} - 3)/2 = (9 -3)/2 = 3, not 4. Hmm, not matching. Maybe I need to derive the formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. The outermost layer is 3*(a_9), and a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to approach it, using the formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in calculating one of them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with multiple layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c = 3, d = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing it as a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, the entire expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. However, the expression is a bit more complicated because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. But since we've already broken it down into layers and used the recurrence relation, and even found a formula, I think that's solid. Alternatively, if I were to write this out, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine sets of parentheses. Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, after the first multiplication by 3, you're adding another 1 and multiplying by 3 again, and so on. It's a nested structure that can be expanded step by step, which we did earlier. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, the result is 88572. I feel confident about this answer because I cross-checked it using two different methods: step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation. Both led me to the same result. I don't think I made any calculation errors because each step was consistent and the formula confirmed the result. So, yeah, I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So the outermost layer is 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's a geometric series kind of structure. Let me represent each layer mathematically. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So 3^{11} = 177147. Then (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the solution efficiently.

Let's see: Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the sequence is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a first-order linear recurrence, we can solve it iteratively or find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we also get the same result, which confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, I could notice that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplying the last term by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Suppose I have a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then, the general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find the closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. Similarly, for n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the general formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so the total sum would be a geometric series with ratio 3. But in this case, the expression is not a sum but a product of terms, so maybe that approach isn't directly applicable. However, since each layer is defined by a recurrence relation, the closed-form solution using the geometric series approach for linear recurrences is appropriate here. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find D first. When n approaches infinity, the term C*3^n will dominate unless C is zero, but since our problem has a finite n, maybe it's better to find a particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the first few terms and see if there's a pattern.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each layer. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=9 corresponds to the 9th layer, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer step by step. That might have saved some time, but since I was practicing step-by-step, I went through each layer.\n\nI think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when I compute step by step, I might have added or multiplied incorrectly. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let's define the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps? The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the formula for the nth layer, \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), we determine Layer 9 to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, that seems correct. Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Adding them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would work. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, since the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B, we can solve for A and B. Let me set up the equation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Assuming L_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3 + B = 3A - 1/2. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series with multiple layers. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). So, it's a series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, repeated multiple times. The closed-form approach seems more efficient, but since I already computed each layer step by step and verified with the closed-form, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given the small number of layers (nine), computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone. If I tried to generalize it, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but perhaps it's overcomplicating for nine terms. But just for practice, let me see if I can find a formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as before. Then layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but given that each layer is dependent on the previous one, the step-by-step computation was straightforward and less error-prone, especially since there are only nine layers. If I had more layers, the formula would be more efficient, but for nine, it's manageable. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Let me just double-check the multiplication step: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.

Hmm, but let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1+3(...)), so that's nine layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, I think I did that correctly. So, each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any errors. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. Let me see if there's a recursive formula or something. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's test this. Plugging into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Using the proposed solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, which is fine. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the proposed solution: L_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4. We already know B = -1/2, so: 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplifying, that's L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we can compute it using the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ), which would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form expression. But since the problem is to compute it step by step, maybe the layer-by-layer approach is more illustrative, even if a bit tedious. So, to recap, starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, and after computing up to Layer 9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, the steps are: 1. Compute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 2. Compute Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 3. Compute Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 4. Compute Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 5. Compute Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 6. Compute Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 7. Compute Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 8. Compute Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 9. Compute Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 10. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing each layer as I go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., up to L9.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let me see. Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me check that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So when n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Wait, but let me check my layers again because that seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >=2. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Since the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, which is 3*L_9. Using the closed-form, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 +3 =4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually computing each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) +1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B +1 = A*3^n + 3B +1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1. So, -2B =1, which gives B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A -1/2 =4. Therefore, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2. So, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression as 3*a_9, where a_9 is as above, so 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Wait, let me check that. 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2=59049. Then, 3^11=3^10*3=59049*3=177147. So, yes, 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, (177147-3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's consistent again. So, all methods lead to the same answer, which makes me more confident that it's correct.

So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since I have only 9 layers, computing each step as I did before is manageable.\n\nBut just to explore, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This looks like a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for this recursion. The general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1, with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 1. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say Layer n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: Layer 2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: Layer 3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I feel like I might have made a mistake earlier when computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Is there a formula or a pattern here that I can use instead of computing each layer manually? Because computing nine layers manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for Layer n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me confirm 3^10. 3^1 is 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation, the general formula for the nth layer is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.

Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\nSo, there are 9 layers in total.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again just to be thorough. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

But wait, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so substituting into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2). So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me verify my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13.

Wait, 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about whether there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for it instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution and confirm the result. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each step out adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). So, that's 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computations. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding step by step is manageable. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. But a_n should also equal C*3^n + D. So, C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, I can compute a few more layers using the closed-form formula to see if they match my previous results. For example, n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which matches Layer 3. n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121, which matches Layer 4. So, the formula works, which gives me more confidence that a_9 =29524 is correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

    "text": " Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, right? So 3 * 29524 is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and verify each step because that's a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check 29524 * 3 another way to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check once more because sometimes when you have multiple layers, especially with similar numbers, it's easy to get lost. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f So, this formula works. Therefore, layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Let's denote the innermost term as x_1 = 1 + 3. Then, x_2 = 1 + 3*x_1, and so on, up to x_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9. From the recurrence relation, we have x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, which we've already solved. So, another way to think about it is that each x_n is contributing a term that's growing exponentially. But since we've already found the closed-form solution, and it gives the same result, I think we're safe. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me check one more time. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Then each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*previous. So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. By computing each layer from the inside out, we find that the innermost term is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Using the closed-form formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we determine the outermost term is 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm my earlier steps because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a direct formula for the entire expression. Let's see. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Using the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and since the entire expression is 3*a_9, that would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to think about it. It's 3^{11}/2 - 3/2, but since 3^{11} is odd, subtracting 3 (which is also odd) gives an even number, so dividing by 2 is clean. So, 3^{11} is 177147, minus 3 is 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's a more formulaic approach, which confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication step again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it as 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, using the standard multiplication method: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 88572. Correct. So, all steps check out, and both the step-by-step computation and the formulaic approach give the same result. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern which can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
