    "text": " Let me check that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

But wait, let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. Let's go back and verify each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems consistent. Each layer builds on the previous one without any errors. So, I think I've computed this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, but since the expression isn't too long, computing each step is manageable. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or something. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is L(n) = A*3^n + B. Let's try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: L(3) = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Seems to work. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10)/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let's denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Notice that inside the first parentheses, it's similar to S/3, because S = 3*(...), so the inner part is S/3. Therefore, S = 3*(1 + 3*(S/3)) = 3*(1 + S). Wait, let's check that: If S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), then the inner expression is 1 + 3*(...), which is equal to S/3. So, S = 3*(1 + S/3). Let me write that equation: S = 3*(1 + S/3). Let's solve for S: S = 3 + S => S - S = 3 => 0 = 3. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, that suggests that my assumption is wrong. Maybe this approach isn't valid because the expression doesn't repeat infinitely; it's finite with nine layers. So, treating it as an infinite series isn't correct here. Therefore, perhaps the recurrence relation method is the way to go, which we already did. So, since the expression has nine layers, it's better to compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula we derived. Either way, we get the same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, it seems like all the layers are correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier for layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is one less than a power of 3, divided by 2. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. But in this case, since we're dealing with n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form expression. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or applying the closed-form formula\u2014the result is consistent: 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with nested expressions that can be easy to miscalculate if not approached systematically.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we confirm that the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which seems like a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a formula for it, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me check if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. We can try to solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did earlier. Alternatively, we can see that each term is 3 times the previous term minus something. Let me try to compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2. Wait, let me check: From L_1 to L_2: 4 to 13. 3*4 = 12, 12 +1=13. So, it's 3*previous +1. Similarly, L_3 = 3*L_2 +1 = 3*13 +1=40. Yes, so the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same answer.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). This looks similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Alternatively, it might form a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, in this case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as computed earlier. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly, which might have saved some time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let's recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about this. Suppose I define each layer as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = (a/(1 - b)) + b^n * C, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, a is 1 and b is 3. So, the homogeneous solution would be L_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + 3^n * C = (-1/2) + C*3^n. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = (-1/2) + C*3^1 => 4 = (-1/2) + 3C => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution would be L_n = (-1/2) + (3/2)*3^n = (-1/2) + (3^{n+1})/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (-1/2) + (3^{2})/2 = (-1/2) + 9/2 = (8/2) = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (-1/2) + (3^3)/2 = (-1/2) + 27/2 = (26/2) = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (-1/2) + (3^4)/2 = (-1/2) + 81/2 = (80/2) = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (-1/2) + (3^{10})/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (-1/2) + 59049/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Let me check each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 12 =13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 39=40 (correct). Layer 4:1 + 120=121 (correct). Layer 5:1 + 363=364 (correct). Layer 6:1 + 1092=1093 (correct). Layer 7:1 + 3279=3280 (correct). Layer 8:1 + 9840=9841 (correct). Layer 9:1 + 29523=29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, giving a_1=4. The outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing a geometric series or something else. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If I denote the entire expression inside as x, then x = 1 + 3x, but wait, that might not be the case here because the expression is finite, with nine layers. If it were infinite, then x = 1 + 3x, which would lead to x = -1/2, but that's not applicable here. Since it's finite, the approach of computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation seems appropriate. So, I think the method I used is solid. Just to recap, I computed each layer from the innermost to the outermost, ensuring that each step was correct. Then, I used a recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, which allowed me to compute the 9th layer directly. Both methods gave me the same result, which adds confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n... and so on.\n\nWait a minute, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nWait, 4 is 4, 13 is 13, 40 is 40, 121 is 121, 364 is 364, 1093 is 1093, 3280 is 3280, 9841 is 9841, 29524 is 29524.\n\nI think these numbers correspond to terms in a geometric sequence or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me check the recurrence relation. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 is correct for each layer. Let's test it with n=1: a_1 should be 4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach to see if it leads to the same result.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, except for the addition of 1 each time.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, it's a bit different. But perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series can help.\n\nWait, but the formula I used earlier for the recurrence relation seems to have given me the correct result, so maybe I don't need to go into the geometric series approach. But just for thoroughness, let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with 9 layers. Let me denote S as the entire expression, so S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. But actually, S is the expression with 9 layers, so S = 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th layer.\n\nBut perhaps another way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Let me see.\n\nWait, from the recurrence relation, we found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2 = 29524, so S=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, then the expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can expand the expression step by step.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression without using the formula, just to see if it still gives me the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1, r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + d, where d is a constant particular solution. To find d, set a_n = d = 1 + 3*d => d = 1 + 3d => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but since each term is built on the previous one, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward. Either way, the result is the same. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but wait, actually, let me recall the formula for the sum of a geometric series because each term is being multiplied by 3 each time. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had recognized the pattern earlier, I could have used the formula instead of computing each layer manually. But since I didn't spot it immediately, breaking it down step by step worked too. It's good to verify the result using a different method to ensure accuracy. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, Layer 1 was 4, Layer 2 was 13, etc. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can consider it as a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, I can write out the terms and see if I can find a pattern. Let's list the terms up to a_9 to see if there's a pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 4 times the previous term minus something. Let me check: 4*4 = 16, which is not 13. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each term is (3^{n} + 1)/2 or something like that. Let me test for n=1: (3^1 + 1)/2 = 4/2=2, which is not a_1=4. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, maybe it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's see: For n=1, (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2, (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3, (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, which matches a_3=40. For n=4, (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=121, which matches a_4=121. For n=5, (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=364, which matches a_5=364. So it seems that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So that's a nice formula. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572, same result. So that's another way to approach it, by recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form formula, which is more efficient than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step is manageable, and it helps to verify the formula.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Let me check that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and each time we have an opening parenthesis, so let's count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1+3( something ). Let's count:\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(...))\n2. 1+3(1+3(...))\n3. 1+3(1+3(...))\n4. 1+3(1+3(...))\n5. 1+3(1+3(...))\n6. 1+3(1+3(...))\n7. 1+3(1+3(...))\n8. 1+3(1+3(...))\n9. 1+3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\" inside each other, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, my initial approach of computing 9 layers from the inside out is correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, which is the 9th layer, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me confirm each step again because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure that I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula here. Let's see if we can find a general formula for L_n. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*(3)^n, and a particular solution can be found as a constant. Let's assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer manually. That's a much faster method. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, let me compute 3^10 just to confirm: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me verify this because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern similar to 1 + 3*(previous layer), which could be modeled as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It looks like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. To solve this, we can write it as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, which is 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10} is 59049, so 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.

Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 =29524.\n\nThus, the original expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\na_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nThis confirms the earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

    "text": " Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let's try to see if this forms a geometric series when expanded. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I let the innermost part be 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous. As we saw earlier, this leads to a recursive relation. But perhaps if I expand E, I can see a pattern. Let's see: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I did before. But perhaps if I consider E as a sum of powers of 3. Let's see: Each time we have 3 multiplied by a term that includes 1 and another 3*... So, maybe E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9 + 3^10? Wait, let me check. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*previous, so when we expand, it's more like a sum of 3^n terms. Let me see: Let me try to compute E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me let x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))), then E = 3*x. But x itself is 1 + 3*x, because it's the same pattern. So, x = 1 + 3x. Then, solving for x: x = 1 + 3x => x - 3x = 1 => -2x = 1 => x = -1/2. Wait, that can't be right because x is clearly positive in our problem. Hmm, maybe this approach is missing something. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the expression has a finite number of layers, so it's not an infinite series but a finite one. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so it's not an infinite recursion but a finite one. Therefore, the approach with the recursive formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 is more appropriate. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. Therefore, E = 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand E step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me work from the innermost parentheses:\n\nStarting with the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, Layer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*(something). So, expanding E, we get:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) = 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nBut this seems like it's leading back to the same recursion. Alternatively, perhaps if I expand all the layers, I can write E as a sum of 3^k.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFrom the layers, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1=4.\n\nWe can write L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut if I look at the coefficients, each L_n can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier, then for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer numerically again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent every time I compute it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach, like using exponents.\n\nSince each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and the previous is similar, maybe we can model this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf we have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))), with 9 layers.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as S = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nSo, S1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to S9.\n\nThen, E = 3*S9.\n\nSo, as before, S9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nE = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf I expand E, it would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent E as a sum:\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*(something), which can be written as 1 + 3*E', where E' is the next layer. So, expanding all the way, E would be a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nLet me count the number of terms. Each layer adds another 3, so with 9 layers, perhaps the expansion would have 9 terms of 3^1, 3^2, up to 3^9, plus some constants. Wait, actually, let me try to expand it:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me expand step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of E as the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k, but that might not be accurate because each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nWait, actually, from the recursive formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, E = 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent as well.\n\nSo, multiple approaches confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Let me verify that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check this multiplication with another method to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go back through each layer and double-check. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So 27000 + 2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I'm ready to present the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer, which equals 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, with the entire expression multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm each step because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic. Let's recast the computation: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12.

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see, solving this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, the answer is 88572. It's reassuring that both methods give the same result. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So yes, the result is 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations because that seems like a big number. Let me go through each layer step by step again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let's denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, but wait, in our earlier computation, we had Layer 1 as a_1 = 4, Layer 2 as a_2 = 13, etc., up to Layer 9 as a_9 = 29524. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. This shows that the answer is consistent whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a formula for a_n, maybe we can use that to compute directly without going through each layer. But in this case, since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable. But it's good to know that a general formula exists for such nested expressions. So, to recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer from the inside out, we arrive at the value of the innermost expression, then build up each subsequent layer, and finally multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the result. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations. Either way, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{inner expression})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. I think I've double-checked all the steps, and everything seems consistent.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me recount each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, yes, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds one more, up to nine layers, so Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nThe general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let me plug n=1 into the general solution:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have nine layers, so n=9. Let me compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation.\n\nBut since the problem is to compute it step by step, perhaps the first method is more appropriate, but knowing the formula is a nice shortcut.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the formula applies correctly here. Because in our case, a_1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is correct as per the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier computation. So yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't know the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, and that this forms a geometric series when expanded. Let me try to see that.\n\nExpanding the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nI see a pattern here. Each layer adds another term which is 3 times the previous term. So, each layer is a sum of powers of 3 up to a certain point.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, each layer n adds up to 3^{n}.\n\nSo, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9.\n\nWait, that's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^9.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nHere, r=3, and the number of terms is 10 (from 3^0 to 3^9), so sum = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich again matches our previous result. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in our initial step-by-step computation, each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer), which resulted in a sum of 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me clarify: When we computed Layer 1 as 1 + 3, that's 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is the sum up to 3^1.\n\nThen, Layer2 is the sum up to 3^2, etc., up to Layer9, which is the sum up to 3^9.\n\nThus, Layer9 = sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it, recognizing the geometric series.\n\nBut since the problem is to compute it step by step, perhaps the initial method is more straightforward, even if it's a bit longer.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrived at the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods (step-by-step expansion, recurrence relation formula, geometric series) all lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is correct. So, yeah, I think 88572 is the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Maybe I can try a different approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can recognize that this expression is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I used two methods: direct computation step by step and solving the recurrence relation. Both gave me the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the ninth layer's value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer computation again.

Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, perhaps this is a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n. Let me denote L(n) as the value of Layer n. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4) = (3^5)/2 -1/2=243/2 -1/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 =88572. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute Layer 9 using the formula again: L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer, and we have 9 layers. Let me think about whether there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for this. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we have L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, and so on up to L_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step, or use the recurrence relation, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6+1=7, 5*3=15, 9*3=27+1=28, 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, that's 88524? Wait, no, wait: 29524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, so 7, carryover 0.\n- Next: 5 * 3 = 15, so 5, carryover 1.\n- Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8, carryover 2.\n- Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 30000 * 3 = 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. So 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that applies here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9. Then, the final result is 3*L_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nI recall that such a recurrence can be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer.\n\nSo, that confirms that the final result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've got this right. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation formula to find a closed-form expression, which made the computation much faster, especially for multiple layers.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me verify a couple of the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could help verify the result or make it faster for larger numbers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), where c is a constant to be determined. Let's see: a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. But from the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so substituting: 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Simplifying: 1 + c = 3c \u21d2 1 = 2c \u21d2 c = 1/2. So, the equation becomes a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). Let me check that: a_n + 1/2 = 3*a_{n-1} + 3*(1/2) = 3*a_{n-1} + 3/2. But from the original equation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so a_n + 1/2 = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + 1/2 = 3/2 + 3*a_{n-1} = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). Yes, that works. Therefore, the sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. The first term b_1 = a_1 + 1/2 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1} = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (3^2)/2 * 3^{n-1} = 3^{n+1}/2. Therefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, using the formula gives the same result without having to compute each layer manually. That's pretty cool. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + D => 4 = 3C + D. Now, let's find another condition. For n=2, a_2=1 + 3*a_1 =1 + 3*4=13. So, a_2=13. Using the general solution: a_2 = C*3^2 + D =9C + D. So, we have two equations: 3C + D =4 and 9C + D =13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9C + D) - (3C + D) =13 -4 =>6C=9 =>C=9/6=3/2. Now, substitute C=3/2 into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + D=4 =>9/2 + D=4 =>D=4 -9/2= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Let me confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 *3=88572. So, I think that's solid. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recursive approach seems more straightforward. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, leading to the formula we derived. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute 29524 *3 once more. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's adding 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, adding 29524 three times: 29524 +29524=59048, +29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down step by step and verifying each layer helped ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of each until the ninth layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Write 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me confirm by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if I did each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, then wrapping it again. So starting from the inside, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each layer is built on the previous one.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of this as a recursive expression. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to f(9), which is the innermost part of the original expression. Then the entire expression is 3*f(9). So if I compute f(9), then multiply by 3, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed f(9) as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me confirm that again. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for f(n).\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 13\n\nf(3) = 40\n\nf(4) = 121\n\nf(5) = 364\n\nf(6) = 1093\n\nf(7) = 3280\n\nf(8) = 9841\n\nf(9) = 29524\n\nI notice that each f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1) = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nThen find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say f_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition f(1) = 4.\n\nf(1) = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. \n\nWe define a function \\(f(n)\\) where each layer is computed as \\(f(n) = 1 + 3 \\cdot f(n-1)\\) with \\(f(1) = 4\\). \n\nCalculating each layer step by step:\n\n1. \\(f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(f(2) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(f(3) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(f(4) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(f(5) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(f(6) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(f(7) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(f(8) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(f(9) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\cdot f(9)\\). \n\nCalculating \\(3 \\cdot 29524\\):\n\n\\[3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Next digit:2*3=6+2=8. So the number is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series or something. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this. Let's denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, I can see that each term is following a pattern where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it's similar to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to 9 terms, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, no, because each term is 1 + 3*(...), so when expanded, each term contributes a 1 and then a 3 times the next term. So, the expansion would actually involve multiple 1s and multiple 3s multiplied in different ways. Maybe it's better to stick with the recursive approach since it worked well. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer numerically again to confirm. Let me list all the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can safely say that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Therefore, the final answer after multiplying by 3 is 88572. Wait, but I just realized, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), where the innermost part is 1+3, and each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first '(', each subsequent '(' adds a layer. Let me count them:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there's a 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on, until the last 1+3). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 wraps around that: 1+3(Layer 1). Layer 3 wraps around Layer 2, and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3 (Layer 1)\n- Then 1+3(Layer1) (Layer2)\n- Then 1+3(Layer2) (Layer3)\n- Then 1+3(Layer3) (Layer4)\n- Then 1+3(Layer4) (Layer5)\n- Then 1+3(Layer5) (Layer6)\n- Then 1+3(Layer6) (Layer7)\n- Then 1+3(Layer7) (Layer8)\n- Then 1+3(Layer8) (Layer9)\n- Then the outermost 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, I think my initial calculation was correct, with Layer9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again, just in case I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLet me write down each layer computation again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, unless I made a multiplication error in one of the layers, this should be correct. Let me check one of the layers where I might have made a mistake. For example, Layer5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Therefore, the final computation is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. It seems like each layer follows a recursive pattern. Maybe I can model it with a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n \u2265 2.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 \u21d2 r = 3\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test it with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nThis method is more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But since the problem only has 9 layers, both methods work fine.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct. So, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Perfect.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can efficiently compute the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).
