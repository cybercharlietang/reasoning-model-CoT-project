    "text": " Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote the entire expression as S. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) But wait, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, in general, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for the nth term. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, S = 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me substitute the general solution into this: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Now, set the left side equal to the right side: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step to see if it forms a geometric series. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try expanding it:\n\nStart from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 + 3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 + 3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 + 3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nIf I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nExpanding this, each term is 3^k for k from 1 to 9, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see:\n\nLet me denote the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nEach time, we have 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*...). So, if I expand E, it would be:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3*3*3*...*3*1.\n\nWait, but how many terms are there? Let me see.\n\nEach time we have a new term when we expand. Let's see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)))\n\nIf I expand E, it's 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nBut that seems recursive. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sum of 3^k for k from 1 to 9, but not exactly because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, from the earlier closed-form solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo, using the formula, E=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as E=3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, which is equivalent to (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nBut perhaps that's getting a bit ahead.\n\nIn any case, both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes in the computations. Each step builds on the previous one correctly, and the closed-form formula corroborates the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. Then, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I also get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in another way. Alternatively, I could notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. So, a_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3, it's more of a linear recurrence. But since I already have the formula, and it's confirmed by both direct computation and the recurrence solution, I'm confident that the answer is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. The general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard solution method is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but for more layers, the formula would be more efficient. Anyway, I think I've confirmed it enough times.

So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, it seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth layer. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln. Each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say D. So, substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches L3=40. Great, the formula works. So, in general, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the general formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. Using a general formula for the nth layer, we confirm that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it formally. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Wait, but in our earlier computation, a_9 was 29524, which is equal to (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Which matches my earlier computation. Similarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula holds.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine 1s. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + d, where d is a constant particular solution. Let me find the particular solution. Assume L_n = d. Then, d = 3*d + 1 => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. Wait, but that seems odd because all our layers are positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the particular solution. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution plus particular solution approach would work better. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized this as a geometric series from the start. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But since each term is built upon the previous one, the formula I derived using the recurrence relation seems appropriate. It's always good to check both by step-by-step computation and by finding a general formula to ensure that the answer is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write it as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), where c is a constant to be determined. Let's find c: a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. But a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so substituting: 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Simplify: 1 + c = 3c => 1 = 2c => c = 1/2. Therefore, a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). So, the sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. Therefore, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. Compute b_1: b_1 = a_1 + 1/2 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (3^2 / 2) * 3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1}) / 2. Therefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a geometric progression.

But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can check a different way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, the problem is to compute a_9, then multiply by 3. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a couple more layers using the formula. For example, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches. a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, which is correct. So, the formula is reliable.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from 4, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find D. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think about the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Let me write the entire expression as: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's denote each innermost expression as follows: Starting from the innermost: Let me define E_1 = 1 + 3 E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 ... up to E_9, and the total expression is 3*E_9. So, E_1 =1 +3=4 E_2=1 +3*4=13 E_3=1 +3*13=40 E_4=1 +3*40=121 E_5=1 +3*121=364 E_6=1 +3*364=1093 E_7=1 +3*1093=3280 E_8=1 +3*3280=9841 E_9=1 +3*9841=29524 Then, total expression=3*E_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the previous methods. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let's see: Starting from the innermost parentheses: E_1 =1 +3 =4 E_2=1 +3*E_1=1 +3*4=1 +12=13 E_3=1 +3*E_2=1 +3*13=1 +39=40 E_4=1 +3*E_3=1 +120=121 E_5=1 +3*121=364 E_6=1 +3*364=1093 E_7=1 +3*1093=3280 E_8=1 +3*3280=9841 E_9=1 +3*9841=29524 Now, 3*E_9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see the pattern. Let me write E_9 as follows: E_9 =1 +3*E_8 =1 +3*(1 +3*E_7)=1 +3 +3^2*E_7=1 +3 +3^2*(1 +3*E_6)=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3*E_6=... Continuing this way, each E_n adds another term of 3^{n-1}. So, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n * E_1. Wait, but E_1=4=1+3, so E_1= sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k =1 +3=4. Wait, that seems to fit. So, in general, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. But wait, when n=1, sum_{k=0}^1 3^k=1+3=4=E_1. When n=2, sum_{k=0}^2 3^k=1+3+9=13=E_2. Similarly, n=3: sum=1+3+9+27=40=E_3. So, yes, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1}-1)/(r-1). Here, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1}-1)/(3-1)=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, E_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for E_9, n=9: E_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is what we had earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*E_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms multiplied by 3. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let me denote each step:\n\nStart with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 +12=13. Next layer: 1 +3*(13)=1+39=40. Next:1+3*40=1+120=121. Next:1+3*121=1+363=364. Next:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Next:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Next:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Next:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Finally, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with everything else. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms, but I think that's similar to the geometric series approach. Let me try to see the pattern in the numbers. Each E_n seems to be 1 +3*E_{n-1}. So, each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence, which we've already solved. So, with the closed-form formula, we can compute E_n directly without computing all the previous terms. For E_9, as we saw, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*E_9=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it multiple ways, so I'm confident that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and each step builds on the previous one correctly. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is straightforward, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a steady state. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n in terms of a_1. Let's try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n. Looking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

    "text": " Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, maybe that would be a faster way instead of computing each term step by step. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Good, the formula works. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation formula, which avoids computing each layer step by step. It's more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, either method works. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute one layer at a time more carefully.

Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7.

Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carried) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also checks out.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. It took a bit of time, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I just had to remember to compute each innermost part first and work my way outward, carefully keeping track of each step to avoid mistakes.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for solving a recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. The solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + (a_0 - c/(1 - r))*(1 - r^{n}), provided r \u2260 1. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me check if I can apply the formula correctly. Let me adjust the indices. Let's say n starts at 1, so a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2. Then, the homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence, maybe it's easier to find a pattern. Alternatively, let me compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier, a_9 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me expand the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2})\n= 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, each time expanding the previous term:\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_{n-3})\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*a_{n-3}\n\nContinuing until we reach a_1:\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}*a_1\n\nSince a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, this gives:\n\na_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n * a_1\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. Each expansion adds another power of 3. So, for a_n:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n * a_1\n\nBut a_1 is 4, so:\n\na_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n * 4\n\nThe sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k is (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 4*3^n\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (3^n - 1)/2 + (8*3^n)/2\n\n= [3^n - 1 + 8*3^n]/2\n\n= (9*3^n - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's compute for n=1:\n\na_1 = (9*3^1 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. But wait, a_1 was 4. Hmm, that's a problem. So my formula must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try again. Let's express a_n in terms of a_1.\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\na_{n-1} = 1 + 3*a_{n-2}\nSo, substituting back:\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\nContinuing this recursively, we get:\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n * a_1\nSince a_1 = 4, we have:\na_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n * 4\n\nNow, the sum sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k is (3^n - 1)/2, as before.\n\nThus, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 4*3^n\n\nLet me compute this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 + 4*3^1 = (3 - 1)/2 + 12 = 2/2 + 12 = 1 + 12 = 13. But wait, a_1 is supposed to be 4, not 13. So there's a mistake here. I think the issue is that when I expanded a_n, I incorrectly included a_1 as 4 in the formula, but in reality, a_1 is the base case, so when n=1, the sum should be just 1, not including 3^0 + ... up to 3^{0}. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the indices.\n\nWait, let's try to express a_n correctly. Starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = 4\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 =3\n3^2=9\n3^3=27\n3^4=81\n3^5=243\n3^6=729\n3^7=2187\n3^8=6561\n3^9=19683\n3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 =59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but let me check. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in my initial calculation, Layer 1 was 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it: The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: At n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without going through each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is n=1, and the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, but in our case, Layer 1 corresponds to n=1, so a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049.

    "text": " Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let me try to find the closed-form solution. First, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is n=1, giving 4. Then Layer 2 is n=2, giving 13, and so on, up to Layer 9, which would be n=9. So, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. But in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula, I can compute the answer directly without having to compute each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since the problem only had nine layers, computing step by step was manageable. It's good to know both methods: one for when you need to verify each step, and another for when you want a quicker solution. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer or using the recurrence relation formula, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, perhaps. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. Good. So, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, (177144)/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's consider the recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then we multiply by 3 as per the original expression: 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, using the recurrence relation, or using the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without going through each layer manually, which might be faster and less error-prone. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, matches Layer 3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, matches Layer 4. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire computation in terms of the formula. Since the original expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form expression. That's pretty cool because it avoids computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming, especially if there were more layers. But in this case, with nine layers, it's manageable, but it's good to know the general formula. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of errors. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me check the numbers: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Let me see if there's a pattern in the numbers. From Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 to 13. 13 is 4*3 + 1 = 13. Layer 2 to Layer 3: 13*3 +1=40. Layer 3 to Layer 4: 40*3 +1=121. Layer 4 to Layer 5: 121*3 +1=364. Layer 5 to Layer 6: 364*3 +1=1093. Layer 6 to Layer 7: 1093*3 +1=3280. Layer 7 to Layer 8: 3280*3 +1=9841. Layer 8 to Layer 9: 9841*3 +1=29524. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That's an interesting pattern. So, if I denote L(n) as the value at layer n, then L(n) = 3*L(n-1) +1, with L(1)=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) +1, with L(1)=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1). Its solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think my earlier calculation was correct. Alternatively, since each layer is defined by L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is L(9) = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value follows the recurrence relation L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. Solving this, we find the nth layer's value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Let's compute L_1 using the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the general formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*(59048)/2 =3*29524=88572. Same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. So, to recap, by computing each layer step by step or by finding a general formula for the layers, both methods lead to the same result: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both approaches confirm the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation, we find that the value of the entire expression is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplify both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute it without going through each layer manually, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the coefficients: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + (1 + 3B). Therefore, B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. That's probably faster, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine, either method works. So, to recap, the expression is 3 times a nested sum that repeats nine times, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. By recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, we can find that the innermost term after nine layers is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives us the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, expanding this, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Now, to find a formula for a_n, since it's a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let me set a_n = A. Then, A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way to compute this without expanding each layer, but since the problem is only 9 layers deep, it's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This looks like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively.

So that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} + B => 3A + B = 4. To find another equation, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general formula: a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B = 13. Now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, since the problem is structured with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(...), and we've established that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, and 3*a_9=88572.

    "text": " Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a linear recurrence, maybe I can find a pattern or formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Now, if I want to find a general formula for a_n, I can solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1 The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if the formula applies correctly for all layers. Since the innermost layer is a_1, and each subsequent layer is a_2 up to a_9, which is correct. So, the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute it step by step, or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we compute up to \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another similar expression)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Proceed Outward Layer by Layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Multiply by 3 for the Outermost Layer:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It seems that each Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Lk. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Lk - 3*Lk-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Lp = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Lk = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when k=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, Lk = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For k=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer k is (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression as a single formula. Let's see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). There are nine 1+3 terms. So, each layer is built upon the previous one, as we saw. Using the formula we derived, the outermost layer is L9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can recognize here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, then the final expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I double-checked by computing each layer step by step and also by finding the general formula for the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a recurrence pattern.

Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but when I compute 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, that's 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of recursive relation. Let\u2019s denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I computed earlier. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series. Let me see. Each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let\u2019s model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s say L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find the particular solution. Assume L(n) = K, a constant. Then substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Wait, that can't be right because our L(n) are all positive. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to solve it as a non-homogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be L(n) = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution L_p. Then:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3L_p = 1 => -2L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we have:\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nSo the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(L(9)) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*next layer.\n\nIf I consider the innermost term as 1 + 3, which is 4, then each layer adds a factor of 3 and adds 1. So, as we saw, each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to compute this without going through each layer. Since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 9 layers, maybe I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, let me consider that each time, the expression is 1 + 3*previous. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, after 9 layers, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*something. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as (3^{10} -1)/2, but then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, from earlier, we saw that L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it, using exponents.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our previous result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly. Each step seems to confirm the result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like a + a(a + a(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or follows a particular pattern. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. To solve such a recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution would be solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which is the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost expression:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Work outward layer by layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
