    "text": " Layer 7: Wait, 3*1093 is 3279? Let me check: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Yes, correct. Then 3279 +1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 +1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 +120=29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. That seems like a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=1+3*4=13, n=3: a3=1+3*13=40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, the problem is essentially computing a_9 and then multiplying by 3. Now, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have n=9, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, we can write it as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Layer 7: 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the recurrence relation approach. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Let's compute the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, set equal to the left side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). This can be modeled as a geometric series, but since each term depends on the previous one, it's more of a recurrence relation as I did before. Another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number that's one more than three times the previous layer, which is why the numbers grow so quickly. It's interesting how the numbers escalate exponentially. For example, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, the value goes from 4 to 29524, which is a huge jump. This makes sense because each step is multiplying by 3, which is an exponential growth. So, the overall expression is 3 multiplied by the 9th term of this sequence, resulting in 88572. I think I've verified it enough times, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a general formula for the nth term, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. After calculating each layer and applying the formula, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with more layers. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me consider that. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9, which is the outermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, we have a recursive relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, so the solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution, which is a constant, say B. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: a1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step. That's a much faster method, especially if there are more layers. But since I only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but it's easy to see how it could get cumbersome. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I was able to find a closed-form solution, which gave me the same result as computing each layer step by step.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved recursively. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.

Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree.

So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which could be faster or more efficient. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, can we find a closed-form formula for a_n? Let's see. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula was a more efficient way to compute the result, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there were only nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable, though time-consuming. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to approach the problem more systematically. I think I've got it right, but let me just double-check my multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the final step. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit again: 29524 \u00d7 3. Starting from the rightmost digit: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 3(....).

Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds another layer.

Let me check with a smaller version to see if the pattern holds. Suppose I have a smaller version: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) Let's compute this manually. Innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Next layer: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40=120. Alternatively, using my method: Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40. 3*40=120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. That's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. It's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. Let's write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. At n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Which matches our earlier step-by-step computation.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a direct formula for the entire expression. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers. But that seems similar to the structure of a_n, but with one less layer. Wait, perhaps I can model this as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n layers. But in our case, n=9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). Wait, actually, the initial expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is 1 + 3*(layer8), etc., down to layer1=1+3. So, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation as I did earlier. Alternatively, using the formula for a_n, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting from layer1: 1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as follows: 29524*3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that adds up correctly. So I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then +1=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This looks like a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence relation. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, using the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let's substitute the general solution into this: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B +1 = A*3^n + 3B +1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1. Then, -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Now, plug B back into the initial condition equation: 3A + (-1/2) =4 => 3A =4 +1/2= 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as before. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the value of the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original expression has nine layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. This method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But for nine layers, either method works. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each time, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition: When n=1, L_1=4. So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So yes, that's correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a geometric progression or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wait, so each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is known, right? It's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is n=9, so (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3: 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula instead of computing each layer step by step. That might have saved some time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. But it's good to know the general formula in case the number of layers increases. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value step by step and verify it with a general formula.

Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. Layer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. Layer 3: n=3, a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step manually. That's a much more efficient way. So, the key was recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence and solving it using standard methods. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize it as a nested pattern that can be broken down using a recurrence relation.

    "text": " Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That's a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Plugging in the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. It's probably faster and less error-prone. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). I recognized the recurrence relation, found a closed-form formula, and confirmed it with both manual computation and the formula. Then, multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final answer. Everything checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

    "text": " Layer 7 was 1 + 3*1093. Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, yes, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested expression. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Alternatively, I could have directly computed a_9 using the formula and then multiplied by 3. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern? It seems like each layer is following the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might be faster. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps it's a geometric series. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, this method confirms the answer. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I'm glad I checked my work using the closed-form formula because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a multiplication error, especially with larger numbers. It's reassuring to see both methods leading to the same result.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few layers again to check for any arithmetic errors. Let's check Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substitute back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Wait, because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads us to the same result. That gives me even more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a geometric progression. The closed-form formula we derived is a geometric series solution. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. Then Layer 2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. Layer 3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, in general, Layer k: a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If there are n layers, then E = 3*a_n, where a_n is as above. So, in our case, n=9, so E=3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, E=(177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572, which is the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By computing each subsequent layer, we find that the innermost layers build up to a value of 29524 at the ninth layer. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, etc., up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a way to express a_n in terms of a geometric series? Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for C and D. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is a_n = C*3^{n} + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. So, equating both sides: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1. Wait, but it's a bit more complicated because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a linear recurrence, which we've already solved. So, I think the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result, which is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer follows a specific pattern.

To make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. For example, let's say the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, three layers. Let's compute it step by step: Innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Then, 3*40 = 120.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. But I think the recurrence approach is clearer here.

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but since it's only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute the value without calculating each layer individually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, the multiplier is 3, so the total after 9 layers would be 3^9 times the initial term plus some sum.

Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. a_3=1+3*a_2=1 +39=40. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.

The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 +3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.

    "text": " Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without doing each layer manually. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a nested expression? It seems similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me think. If I have a recurrence relation like L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4, then this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have L9, which is n=9. So, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this without going through each layer by recognizing the pattern early on. But since I already have the formula, it's more efficient. So, the key steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and that each layer can be computed from the previous one. 2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. 3. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation and solve it. 4. Apply the formula to find the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3. Either way, the answer comes out to 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think if there's a better way to approach this without computing each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 ... up to L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 Then the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = (a*r^{n} - a)/(r - 1) + c, where c is a constant. Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*r^n, where r is the common ratio. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a + r*K => K - r*K = a => K(1 - r) = a => K = a/(1 - r). So the general solution is L_n = C*r^n + a/(1 - r). Using the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, for n=1: L_1 = C*r^1 + a/(1 - r) = C*r + a/(1 - r) = 4. Here, a is 1, and r is 3. So, L_1 = C*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 3C + 1/(-2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049; 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572 as the final answer. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my computations for each layer once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step approach. Layer 1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Correct. So, all layers check out, and the final computation is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the final result is 3*a_9. Now, I recall that such recursive sequences can sometimes be expressed using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2. Similarly, for n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is a_3. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have a_9, let's compute that: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, let me compute a_9 using the formula and then multiply by 3. 3^{10} is indeed 59049, so a_9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the correct way to break it down because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n \u2265 2, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.

Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result.

Let me try to expand this expression step by step, but that might get too long. Alternatively, since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Let me consider that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, the key was recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence and then solving it either by iteration or by finding the closed-form expression. Both methods led me to the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then 9840 +1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 29523 +1 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me think if there's a general formula for expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...))). I recall that for a finite nested expression like this, where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer), and there are n layers, the value can be expressed using a geometric series. Specifically, each layer can be seen as adding another power of 3. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 Hmm, so each layer seems to be the sum of a geometric series up to 3^{k} where k is the layer number. Wait, let me check: Layer 1: 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 Layer 3: 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 Layer 4: 121 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 Wait, but when I computed Layer 4, I got 121, which is indeed 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Similarly, Layer 5: 364. Let me check if that's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243. Let's compute that: 1 + 3 = 4, +9=13, +27=40, +81=121, +243=364. Yes, that's correct. So each layer k is the sum of the geometric series from 3^0 up to 3^{k}. So, the sum S_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) ) = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Wait, let me confirm that formula. The sum of a geometric series from n=0 to n=k of 3^n is (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 1: k=1, S_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. Layer 2: k=2, S_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: S_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, each Layer k is S_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, S_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * S_9 = 3 * 29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the geometric series formula\u2014lead to the same result. So, yeah, that's how I would approach this problem.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me write them out: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 wraps around that, Layer 3 around Layer 2, etc., until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, 9 layers in total. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, getting 88572, that should be correct. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution. L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. If L_{n} = A*3^{n} + B, then L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula instead of computing each layer. This seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there were only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Just needed to be careful with each multiplication and addition. I think I did everything correctly. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. All these steps check out, and the formula also confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the numbers: a1 = 4 a2 = 13 a3 = 40 a4 = 121 a5 = 364 a6 = 1093 a7 = 3280 a8 = 9841 a9 = 29524 Let me see if there's a pattern in the multipliers. From a1 to a2: 4 to 13: 13 = 3*4 +1. Similarly, a2 = 3*a1 +1? Wait, 3*4 +1=13, yes. a3 = 3*a2 +1=3*13+1=40, yes. So, it seems that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, an = 3*a(n-1) +1, with a1=4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for an. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The recurrence is an = 3*a(n-1) +1. The homogeneous equation is an - 3*a(n-1) = 0, characteristic equation r=3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution A. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A +1 => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, general solution is an = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying initial condition a1=4. When n=1, a1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, an= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's consistent with what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the innermost expression, a9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since each layer is a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recursive expression? Let me see. The expression a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem since we only have 9 layers. But just for fun, let me try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me check: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. But since the problem only had 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. It's good to know that there's a formula in case the number of layers is larger, though. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Layer 7: 3280. Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000+840=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if this forms a geometric series or something. Let me think. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, so each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, yes, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{10} = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems solid. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. But since the expression is finite, with nine layers, the formula I found using the recurrence seems more straightforward. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 3L_{n-1} + 1 \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\), we find a closed-form formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 9840 +1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. I think that confirms that the answer is correct.

The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Setting a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9.

Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for each layer. Let\u2019s denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the values at each layer.

This seems like a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's see, each term is defined as Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a simple linear recurrence, we can solve it iteratively. Let's try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let me compute the first few terms to see the pattern: L1 = 4 L2 = 13 L3 = 40 L4 = 121 L5 = 364 L6 = 1093 L7 = 3280 L8 = 9841 L9 = 29524 Let me see if these numbers relate to powers of 3. Let's compute 3^0 = 1, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Hmm, 3^9 is 19683, which is less than L9=29524. Let me see if there's a relation between Ln and 3^n. Let me compute Ln + something: L1=4=3 +1=3^1 +1 L2=13=3^2 + 4=9 +4=13 L3=40=3^3 + 27 +1=27 + 13=40 Wait, that might not be consistent. Alternatively, perhaps each Ln is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test that. For L1: n=1: (3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. L2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct. L3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40. Correct.

Correct. L9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=29524. Correct. So, the general formula for Ln is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. That's a neat formula. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L9, is (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. That's consistent with what I got before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, since L9 = (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with each layer. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the ninth layer, \\(L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3( is the first, then each closing parenthesis corresponds to moving out one layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1+3(, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first \"(\" is after the initial 3, then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"(\" after the first one: Each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. So, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3) is the innermost, then moving out, each layer adds another \"1+3(\". So, let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sections. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me try to parse this:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3), so that's Layer 1: 1+3\n2. The next layer is 1+3(Layer1)\n3. Then 1+3(Layer2)\n4. And so on, until Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"(\", I think there are 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then the first \"1+3(\", then another \"1+3(\", and so on. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, then:\n\n1. 3(1+3( ... So, that's the first \"1+3(\", which would be Layer1: 1+3\n2. Then inside that, another \"1+3(\", which is Layer2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n3. And so on, until we reach the innermost \"1+3)\", which is Layer9: 1+3\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, I think it's 9 layers, meaning that the innermost is Layer9: 1+3, then Layer8 wraps around that, etc., up to Layer1, which is the first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer1). Hmm, maybe I got the layers numbered the opposite way before. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards. So, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer1: 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Let me just confirm each layer's computation:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all checks out. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each layer is correctly computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer as we go. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
