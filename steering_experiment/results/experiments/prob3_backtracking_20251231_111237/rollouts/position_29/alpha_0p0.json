    "text": " Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Wait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: innermost, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9: outermost. So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using the formula for a geometric series or some kind of recursive relation. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent when calculating 3^{10}, let me double-check: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding all the layers, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since it's finite, with 9 layers, it's more of a finite geometric series. But I think the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward here. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term step by step again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent each time. I don't see any mistakes in the arithmetic here. So, I think the answer is indeed 88572. I guess another way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in a base-3 system, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. However, the recurrence relation method seems solid, and the step-by-step computation also checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify each step again to be sure. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using the formula for such sequences. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (c*r^{n} - c)/(r - 1) + initial term.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so r=3, c=1, and a_1=4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the first term is a_1=4, which is 1+3. Then a_2=1+3*a_1, etc. So, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nTo solve this, let's consider the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. Let's take n=1: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing from the top: 8 (from 2*3+2), then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but when I write it out, it's 88572. Hmm, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3.

So, let me compute that: 3*(29524) = 88572 Hmm, wait a second. Let me verify these calculations because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Wait, 3*364 is 1092? Let me check: 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Yes, correct. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly because I started with Layer 1 as the innermost and went up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, yes, Layer 9 is the one right before the outermost 3(...). So, I think my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these kinds of expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier calculations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer. I think that's solid. Just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, yes, 88572 is the correct result.

Maybe I should write it out properly:\n\n  29524\n\u00d7      3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's 88,572. Let me verify that again. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = (20,000 \u00d7 3) + (9,000 \u00d7 3) + (500 \u00d7 3) + (20 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u00d7 3)\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when I'm doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one step, which affects all subsequent layers.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is calculated properly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives us 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, let's compute that: Final result: 3*29524 = ? Hmm, I need to calculate 3*29524. Let me do that step by step. 3*29524: First, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is actually 88572. Let me check that again to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 3*3=9. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just multiply 29524 by 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me retrace my steps to check for errors. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, let's see if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). Then, the sequence goes: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the 9th term is 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, this recursive relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved as a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can solve for the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. So, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Proceed to Next Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   - Final Result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3.

Alternatively, I can add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, and then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524. Adding units place: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\nGiven that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis matches the result I got when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. Then 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdd them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've got it right. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped a lot. It's interesting how the nested expressions form a geometric progression, allowing us to find a closed-form solution. That makes solving such problems more efficient once you recognize the pattern.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 &= 13, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nTo verify, we use the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). The general solution is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\nThus, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, it's 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me write it out vertically to make sure:\n\n```\n  29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n```\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, the result is 88572. Let me verify this calculation another way to be sure. Alternatively, I can break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms the result. So, the final value of the entire expression is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. To recap, I computed each layer starting from the innermost parentheses, working my way out, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3. Each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, which I did iteratively. I double-checked the final multiplication to ensure accuracy, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Wait, no. Wait, let me check the original expression again. It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So, actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any.

So, starting from the innermost, I have: 1. 1+3 2. 1+3(...) 3. 1+3(...) and so on, until the outermost. Let me see, the expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3.

Let me compute that step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27 + the carried over 2?

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost, the first is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each time you go out, you add another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(...).\n\nLet me write it down:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and a \"(\", so each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+\" after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression, starting after the first 3(, we have 1+3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many \"1+\" are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, the first is 1+3(...), then inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on, until we reach the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, the number of \"1+\" is equal to the number of layers. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers because the innermost is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is the first layer, so when I computed up to Layer 9, that's the outermost. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, when I start from the innermost, that's Layer 1, then each time I go out, that's the next layer. So, the expression has 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's the outermost, and then I multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, and Layer 9 as the outermost, which is correct. So, the final result is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again: The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might be a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nWith L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small (only 9), it's easier to compute each step manually, as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation can be expressed as:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its closed-form solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for L_n is:\n\nL_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, let's write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5:\n\nL_5 = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6:\n\nL_6 = (3^{7} - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7:\n\nL_7 = (3^{8} - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8:\n\nL_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, using this formula, L_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, everything checks out.\n\nSo, the step-by-step process is:\n\n1.

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. So, each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the number of layers, each multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it does add up quickly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is known. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} is 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which is the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula, which might be faster for larger n. But in this case, since n=9, computing each layer step by step wasn't too bad, but for larger n, the formula would be more efficient. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Maybe I miscalculated one of the layers earlier on. Let me go back and verify each step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is built upon the previous one. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see if this matches what I did before. a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Yep, same as before. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering how each layer was tripling the previous value, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let's think about it as a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might help me compute it without calculating each layer. Let's try to model this. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, as we saw, each layer can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, if I expand it all the way, the entire expression before the outermost 3 is a_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers. So, the expansion would involve terms like 3^8, 3^7, etc., each multiplied by 1. Let me try to write it out. a_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) If I keep expanding, each layer adds another power of 3. So, the expression can be written as a sum: a_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Because each time you have 1 + 3*(...), so when you expand, each 1 contributes a term, and the 3s multiply the inner terms. Let me test this with a smaller number of layers. Suppose we have a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Alternatively, 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Correct. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Alternatively, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Correct. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}. But wait, in our case, a_9 is built with 9 layers, each adding a power of 3. So, if n=9, then a_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. That's a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and 9 terms. The sum of such a series is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier we had a_9 = 29524. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping. Let me clarify. Each a_n corresponds to n layers. So, for a_1, it's 1 layer: 1 + 3 = 4. For a_2, it's 2 layers: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 13. Which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k. Therefore, a_9 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier when using the recursive formula, we had a_9 = 29524. That's a discrepancy. So, I must have made a mistake in the mapping. Let me go back. The original problem has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each layer adds one more 3 multiplication. So, when I compute a_9, it's after 9 layers. But in my initial approach, I had a_1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each a_n is built from a_{n-1}. So, the number of terms in a_n is n, starting from 1 term at a_1, up to 9 terms at a_9. Wait, but in the expansion, a_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, which is 9 terms, summing to (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. But earlier, when using the recursive formula, I got a_9 = 29524. So, which is correct? Let me compute a_3 using both methods. Using the recursive formula: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Using the expansion: a_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Wait, no, that's a_2. Wait, hold on. Maybe I'm confusing the indices. If a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1. a_2 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2. a_3 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but for a_1, n=1: sum from k=0 to 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. For a_2, sum from k=0 to 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Correct. For a_3, sum from k=0 to 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Correct. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Therefore, the sum is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the sum up to k=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the recursive calculation. So, earlier, when I thought a_9 was the sum up to k=8, that was incorrect. Actually, a_9 is the sum up to k=9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That makes sense now. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just summarize the steps to ensure clarity: 1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting with Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. 3. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). 4. After computing up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 5. Alternatively, model the expression as a geometric series and use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to find the total, then multiply by 3. Both methods lead to the same answer, confirming that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. This process is repeated for each layer, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   Compute the innermost parentheses:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   Substitute Layer 1 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   Substitute Layer 2 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   Substitute Layer 3 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   Substitute Layer 4 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   Substitute Layer 5 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   Substitute Layer 6 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   Substitute Layer 7 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost):**  \n   Substitute Layer 8 into the final layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, that's right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, that's correct.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's compute the first few layers: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 13 L_3 = 40 L_4 = 121 L_5 = 364 L_6 = 1093 L_7 = 3280 L_8 = 9841 L_9 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, they seem familiar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute that: 29524*3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

I think that makes sense because each layer is growing exponentially due to the multiplicative factor of 3. So, each time we go a layer out, the value increases by a factor of 3 plus 1, which leads to rapid growth. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying each calculation, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, the final step is: Final result: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572.

So, yes, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that's a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it that way to confirm. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find a closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3 times 29524: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But let me check the multiplication step again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I could think about this problem as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series to verify the result another way. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches my previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this method also confirms that the result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series and compute it that way. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this expression step by step, although it's quite nested. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: Let me denote the innermost part as x. So, x = 1 + 3 =4. Then, moving one layer out: y = 1 + 3x =1 +12=13. Next layer: z=1 +3y=1 +39=40. Then, w=1 +3z=1 +120=121. Next, v=1 +3w=1 +363=364. Then, u=1 +3v=1 +1092=1093. Next, t=1 +3u=1 +3279=3280. Then, s=1 +3t=1 +9840=9841. Next, r=1 +3s=1 +29523=29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*r=3*29524=88572. So, same result again. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Let's see: Let me think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). There are 9 layers of 1 + 3*... So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps I can model this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Let me denote the innermost term as t_1 =1 + 3. Then, t_2=1 +3*t_1, and so on, up to t_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*t_9. So, t_n =1 + 3*t_{n-1}, with t_1=4. As I found earlier, t_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, t_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*t_9=88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Alternatively, if I try to expand the entire expression, it's going to be a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by coefficients. Let me see: Let's try to expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 =4. Then, moving out: 1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13. Then, 1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40. Then, 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Then, 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, same result. I think I've done this multiple ways now: step-by-step computation, recognizing the recurrence relation, using the formula for a geometric series, and each time I get the same result, 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me compute the expression using another method, perhaps by expanding each term and adding them up. Let me try to expand the entire expression as a sum. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand this expression step by step, writing each multiplication out. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 =4\n2. Next layer: 1 +3*(4)=13\n3. Next: 1 +3*(13)=40\n4. Next: 1 +3*40=121\n5. Next: 1 +3*121=364\n6. Next: 1 +3*364=1093\n7. Next: 1 +3*1093=3280\n8. Next: 1 +3*3280=9841\n9. Next: 1 +3*9841=29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524=88572\n\nEach step is straightforward, and each result is correct as per previous calculations. So, this method also leads me to the same conclusion. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)))) with nine layers. Let me try to express this as a sum of powers of 3. Each time we have a 1 added, it's multiplied by 3 multiple times depending on its depth. For example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1 which is multiplied by 3^0=1. Similarly, the 3s inside each parentheses are also contributing to the total. Wait, maybe I can model this as a geometric series where each term is 3^k, where k is the number of layers from the innermost to the current one. Let me try to think about it. Let me denote the innermost term as t_1 =1 +3. Then, t_2=1 +3*t_1, and so on, up to t_9. Then, t_9 is the term that's multiplied by 3 in the outermost layer. So, t_9=1 +3*t_8. Let me see if I can express t_n as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me write t_n as t_n=1 +3*t_{n-1}. So, recursively, each t_n is 1 +3*(1 +3*t_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*t_{n-2}. Continuing this, t_n=1 +3 +3^2 + ... +3^{n-1}*t_1. Since t_1=1 +3=4, then t_n= sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n* t_1. Wait, that might be a way to express it. Let me check for n=2: t_2=1 +3*t_1=1 +3*(4)=13. Using the formula: sum_{k=0}^{1}3^k +3^2*4= (1 +3) +9*4=4 +36=40. Wait, but t_2 is 13, not 40. So, that approach might not be correct. Maybe I need to think differently. Alternatively, since each t_n =1 +3*t_{n-1}, and t_1=4, perhaps I can write t_n as t_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I did earlier. Then, t_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*t_9=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum where each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to a certain power. Let me see: The innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, because it's inside eight layers of multiplication by 3. Similarly, the next 1 is inside seven layers, so multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0=1. Then, each of these 1s is added together, and each 3 is also contributing as part of the terms. Wait, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand the expression without parentheses. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step, writing each multiplication out:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) )\n\nLet me compute the innermost part first:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*Layer1 =1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*Layer2=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*Layer3=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*Layer4=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*Layer5=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*Layer6=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*Layer7=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*Layer8=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, E=3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, same result again. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of each addition of 1 as contributing to a sum that's multiplied by 3 each time. So, each 1 is effectively contributing 3^k where k is the number of layers it's nested within. Let me see: Starting from the innermost 1, it's multiplied by 3^8 because it's inside eight layers of 3 multiplications. Then, the next 1 is inside seven layers, so multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the sum of all the 1s would be 1*(3^8 +3^7 +3^6 +...+3^0). Similarly, each 3 inside the parentheses is also contributing. Wait, but in the original expression, each layer is 1 +3*(...), so each 3 is multiplied by the next layer. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted. Perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation or the recurrence relation method, which both give consistent results.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 2 * 3 = 6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, putting it all together, each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost, which was 4, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to Layer 9, which was 29524, multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.

Because the original expression is 3*(...), and the ... part is Layer 9. So, let's compute that: Total = 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, that can't be right because when I did 29524 * 3, I think I made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me try again without breaking it into parts: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 3*3=9. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly: 29524 * 3: Let's compute digit by digit from right to left: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 3*3=9. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to just do 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake in the layer computations. Let me go back step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I feel like 88,572 is a big number, but given the depth of nesting, it might be right. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, especially if they're repeated multiple times. Let me think about this. Suppose I have an expression like x = 1 + 3x. Then, solving for x would give x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's for an infinite nesting. In our case, the nesting is finite, so it's different. However, perhaps I can find a pattern or a recursive formula. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, let's compute each L_n step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. L1: 1 +3=4. L2:1 +3*4=13. L3:1 +3*13=40. L4:1 +3*40=121. L5:1 +3*121=364. L6:1 +3*364=1093. L7:1 +3*1093=3280. L8:1 +3*3280=9841. L9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern in the L_n values. Let's list them: L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_{n} = 3*L_{n-1} +1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for L_n and then multiplied by 3 directly. So, 3*L9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Okay, that seems correct. Let me just verify each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems to check out. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this with a formula to confirm the result. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Now, since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using the formula. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so the outermost layer is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, both methods give the same answer, which makes me confident that 88572 is correct.

So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

I think I did each calculation correctly, but just to be sure, maybe I can check one of the layers again. Let's pick Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That seems right.

    "text": " Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, this seems confusing. Maybe it's easier to do it step by step. Let me write it out: 29524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24) * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each step again. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That's similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for such a recurrence. Let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+...). Let me see: Each time, it's 1+3(...), and I can see that there are nine layers, as I initially thought. So, layer 9 would be the outermost one. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had layer 1 as the innermost, and layer 9 as the outermost. But according to the formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer from the innermost. So, in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me try to compute one more layer using the formula to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's say n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which matches my earlier computation of layer 5. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Using the formula for the nth layer, \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we find the outermost layer's value and multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Expression:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, but wait a second, let me confirm each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate anywhere. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 (Correct)\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d73 =12, write 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7\n5 \u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It seems like there are nine layers because each time you have 1 + 3(...), and each time it's nested one more time. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, 9 layers in total. So, my calculation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Therefore, the total is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that the number of layers is correct. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside each other. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, which is the outermost. So yes, 9 layers, which I've computed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + c, where c is a constant if the recurrence is homogeneous. Wait, actually, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the closed-form solution is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, where L_0 is the initial term. But in our case, the initial term is L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, perhaps we can model this as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as I calculated earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which expands to 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) and so on. This is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. The total number of terms in the series would be n terms, where n is the number of layers. But since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. Wait, but in this case, it's a nested expression, not a simple series, so maybe the closed-form approach is more straightforward. Either way, the result seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again more carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279? Let me compute that again: 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the outermost layer is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, just to make sure, maybe I should approach this problem differently, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but nested. Let's see if I can model this. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1, then a2 = 1 + 3a1, a3 = 1 + 3a2, and so on up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 1 + 3. Wait, no, the innermost expression is a1 = 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I did earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. So, when n=1, a1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, which matches the manual computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have computed a9 using the formula directly: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Either way, the result is the same. I think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Just to be thorough, I'll compute 3^{10} to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3: 29524*3, as I computed earlier, is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the outermost layer efficiently. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I need to compute 3 times 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute this step by step. First, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28.

Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29,524 * 3\n= (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering the number of layers, it might make sense.

I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this more efficiently, especially since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me think about whether there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Specifically, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. Hmm, this recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression, which might make computation easier, especially for larger n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2,187\n3^8 = 6,561\n3^9 = 19,683\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, 3^{10} = 59,049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29,524, and then 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I would have had to compute each layer step by step, which is what I did initially. But recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it is a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were much larger.\n\nIn summary, by computing each nested layer step by step and then verifying using a closed-form expression derived from the recurrence relation, I determined that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72.

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This seems similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the nth layer, where n goes from 1 to 9. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the multiplication just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. I think that's it. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable.

So, the final step is to compute: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Then each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*previous. Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40, Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121, Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, the 9th layer, which is a_9, is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and after 9 layers, a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572. So, I think I've got the correct answer here. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Starting from the innermost, I computed each layer step by step, which gave me the 9th layer as 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result, 88572. Alternatively, by solving the recurrence relation, I found that each layer a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572. Both methods lead to the same answer, so I feel confident that 88572 is correct. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors because I double-checked each step and also used a different method (recurrence relation) to confirm the result. So, yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is to compute: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3)\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.

I think I did that correctly. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, L_9 = 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. It seems that using the recurrence relation and solving it gives the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, the total expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series. Let me explore that perspective as well, just to see if it aligns with my previous findings. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. If I expand it, it would be 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3*3^9. Wait, let me see: Each time you open a new parenthesis, you're effectively adding another power of 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, when you expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3*3^9. But wait, actually, the number of terms might be different. Let me count how many terms there are when fully expanded. Since there are nine layers, each time you're adding a term, so the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3*3^9. Let me check that. Each layer adds another exponent. So, starting from the innermost, which is 3^1, then moving out, it's 3^2, up to 3^9, multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, but when you have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, actually, when expanded, each term is 3^n where n starts from 0. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a smaller example to see the pattern. Suppose I have just one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. If I expand it, it's 3 + 3*3 = 3 + 9 = 12. So, that's two terms. For two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39. Expanding it: 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 = 3 + 9 + 27 = 39. So, that's three terms. For three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Expanding: 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120. So, four terms. Wait, so for n layers, the expansion has n+1 terms, each being 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n+1}. Wait, let me see:\n\nFor 1 layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3 + 9 = 12. Which is 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nFor 2 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3 + 9 + 27 = 39. Which is 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nFor 3 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120. Which is 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4.\n\nSo, it seems that for each additional layer, we're adding another term in the geometric series. Therefore, for nine layers, the expansion would be 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}. Because the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3^1 + 1, but when multiplied by 3, it becomes 3^2 + 3, and so on. Wait, but in the first case, with one layer, it was 3^1 + 3^2. So, for nine layers, it's 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{10}. Let me confirm that with the earlier formula. We had L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Alternatively, the sum of the geometric series from 3^1 to 3^{10} is (3^{11} - 3)/ (3 - 1) ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Which matches the expression above. So, indeed, the entire expression simplifies to the sum of the geometric series from 3^1 to 3^{10}, which is (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Which matches my earlier result. Therefore, both methods lead me to the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I've explored this problem thoroughly, using both step-by-step expansion and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Both approaches confirm that the result is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's find another equation. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, let's compute that: Total = 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the total is 88572. I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: n=1, giving 4. Then, Layer 2 is n=2, giving 13, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get to the same answer, which confirms that the result is correct. It's interesting that recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a formula, which might have saved time if the expression were even more nested. But for nine layers, computing each step was manageable. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, let's compute that: Final result: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is just multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, which is a geometric progression. Wait a second, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If we have an expression like a + a(a + a(a + ... )), it's similar to a geometric series. The general form is something like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)). So, if we have n layers, the value can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me test it with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Which matches Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Which matches Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Which matches Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. So, n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which is exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using the formula for such a geometric progression, we find that the value after 9 layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm. Another approach might be to recognize the pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. We can compute each a_n step by step, which is exactly what I did earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous with constant coefficients. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into this form. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. But according to our assumed form, a_n = C*3^n + D. Therefore, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which increases my confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let's see. If I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's try expanding this step by step. Let me denote the innermost part as follows: Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me call the innermost expression E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression without parentheses, it would be a sum of terms each multiplied by 3 raised to a certain power. Let me see if I can express this as a geometric series. Starting from the innermost term: Each time, we have 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer adds a term that is 3^n multiplied by 1, where n increases by one each layer. Let me try to write the entire expression as a sum. Let's denote the entire expression as S. S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, as I did before, each layer is a term in the sequence. But perhaps if I expand S, it's a sum of 3^k terms. Let's see. Let me try to write S as follows: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand the innermost part first. Let me define each layer as E1, E2, ..., E9 as before. Then, S = 3*E9. But E9 = 1 + 3*E8, and so on, down to E1 = 1 + 3. So, if I expand E9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) Which is 1 + 3*E8. Similarly, E8 = 1 + 3*E7, and so on. So, when I expand S, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) But this seems like a tree with depth 9. Alternatively, maybe I can express S in terms of a sum where each term is 3^k, but I need to think about how the coefficients add up. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer adds another power of 3 multiplied by 1. Let me try to write S as a sum. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost term, each layer adds a term that is 3^k. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, so E3 = 1 + 3*(E2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, each layer adds another term which is 3^(n) where n is the layer number. So, E1 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nAnd so on, up to E9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nYes, that seems to be the case. So, in general, En = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n.\n\nTherefore, E9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9.\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term a = 1, common ratio r = 3, and number of terms n = 10 (from 3^0 to 3^9).\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is given by S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nSo, E9 = (3^10 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, S = 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this method also confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by coefficients. Let me see:\n\nIf I expand S, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nEach time, we have a 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, expanding step by step, S would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet's try expanding this:\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, S = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, again, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but that might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if there's a pattern in the numbers we're getting: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88572.\n\nLooking at these numbers, each is one more than a multiple of 3. For example, 4 = 3 + 1, 13 = 9 + 4, wait, that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the ratio between consecutive terms.\n\nFrom 4 to 13: 13/4 \u2248 3.25.\n\nFrom 13 to 40: 40/13 \u2248 3.077.\n\nFrom 40 to 121: 121/40 \u2248 3.025.\n\nFrom 121 to 364: 364/121 \u2248 3.008.\n\nFrom 364 to 1093: 1093/364 \u2248 3.000.\n\nFrom 1093 to 3280: 3280/1093 \u2248 3.000.\n\nSimilarly, the next terms are approaching 3 as the ratio, which makes sense because each term is defined as 1 + 3*previous term, so as n increases, the term approaches the behavior of 3^n.\n\nBut perhaps that's more of an asymptotic analysis rather than helpful for computation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table of n and a_n to see the pattern:\n\nn | a_n\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n10| 88572\n\nLooking at this table, I can see that each a_n is roughly 3 times the previous a_n, minus 2. Let me check:\n\na_2 = 13, which is 3*4 + 1 = 13. Wait, 3*4 = 12 +1=13. Similarly, a_3 = 3*13 +1=40. Yes, 3*13=39 +1=40. Similarly, a_4=3*40 +1=121. So, in general, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. Wait, but earlier we had a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which is the same as a_n=3*a_{n-1}+1. So, that's correct.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. We've already solved it earlier, finding the closed-form solution as a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and S=3*a_9=88572.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same conclusion, which makes me confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the problem, with each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. Decide to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.\n\n3. Compute each layer's value, verifying each step to prevent arithmetic errors.\n\n4. Notice that the problem can be modeled as a recurrence relation, leading to a closed-form solution using geometric series properties.\n\n5. Confirm the result by expanding the entire expression and computing the final value.\n\n6. Cross-verify using multiple methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nThrough all these steps, I arrived at the solution 88,572. I think I've covered all possible angles to approach this problem and have thoroughly checked each step, so I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute the value step by step. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Proceed outward, each time computing \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous result}\\).\n3. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the outermost term is 29,524.\n4. Finally, multiply this result by 3 to get the total value.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
