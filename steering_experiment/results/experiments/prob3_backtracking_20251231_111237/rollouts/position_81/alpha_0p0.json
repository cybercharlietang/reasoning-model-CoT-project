Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which would make it easier instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This kind of recursive structure might relate to a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, doing it manually isn't too bad. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 3^2 + 3 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1 = 3*(3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1 = 3*(3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer n is equal to 3^n + 3^(n-1) + ... + 3 + 1. That is, each layer is a geometric series. Specifically, Layer k is equal to (3^(k+1) - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2. Let me check that formula. For Layer 1: k=1, so (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. Layer 2: k=2, (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, yes, each layer k is (3^(k+1) -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost layer is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I consider the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, the innermost is 1+3=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous. As I noticed earlier, each layer is a sum of a geometric series. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Wait, let me think. Wait, each layer is a sum of powers of 3 up to a certain point. For example, Layer 1: 3^0 + 3^1 =1 +3=4. Layer 2: 3^0 + 3^1 +3^2=1 +3 +9=13. Layer 3:1 +3 +9 +27=40. And so on. So, Layer k: sum from i=0 to k of 3^i = (3^(k+1) -1)/2. So, Layer 9: sum from i=0 to 9 of 3^i = (3^10 -1)/2=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(sum from i=0 to 9 of 3^i). Wait, but actually, each time you go a layer out, you add another term in the geometric series. So, the innermost is 3^0 +3^1, then next is 3^0 +3^1 +3^2, etc., up to 3^0 +3^1 +...+3^9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(sum from i=0 to 9 of 3^i). Therefore, the sum is (3^10 -1)/2, so 3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. That's a more formulaic approach, recognizing the geometric series. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the geometric series formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer forms a geometric series. The outermost expression is 3 times the sum of a geometric series with 10 terms, leading to the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is defined by L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => 0 = 1 + 2*L_p => L_p = -1/2. Wait, that's a negative number, but our layers are all positive. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't the best here, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the recurrence as L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. Let's compute the first few terms to see if we can find a pattern: L(1) = 4 L(2) = 3*4 + 1 = 13 L(3) = 3*13 + 1 = 40 L(4) = 3*40 + 1 = 121 L(5) = 3*121 + 1 = 364 L(6) = 3*364 + 1 = 1093 L(7) = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280 L(8) = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841 L(9) = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Now, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's plug in n=0, but wait, we don't have L(0). Alternatively, we can use the particular solution approach again. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the sum as a geometric series. Let's write the recurrence as L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. Let's unroll it:\n\nL(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1\n= 3*(3*L(n-2) + 1) + 1\n= 3^2*L(n-2) + 3*1 + 1\n= 3^2*(3*L(n-3) + 1) + 3 + 1\n= 3^3*L(n-3) + 3^2 + 3 + 1\nContinuing this pattern, after n-1 steps, we get:\nL(n) = 3^{n-1}*L(1) + 3^{n-2} + 3^{n-3} + ... + 3^1 + 3^0\n\nSince L(1) = 4, we have:\nL(n) = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\nBecause the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but here we have the sum from k=0 to n-2, because the first term is 3^{n-1} and the last term is 3^0. Wait, let's see: The sum is 3^{n-2} + 3^{n-3} + ... + 3^1 + 3^0. That's a geometric series with m = n-1 terms, first term a=1, ratio r=3. So the sum is (3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L(n) = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me simplify this:\n\nL(n) = (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n= (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n= (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, because 9*3^{n-1} = 3^2 * 3^{n-1} = 3^{n+1}? Wait, no, 9*3^{n-1} = 3^2 * 3^{n-1} = 3^{n+1}? Wait, 3^2 is 9, so 9*3^{n-1} = 3^{2 + n -1} = 3^{n+1}. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 3^{n-1} multiplied by 3^2 is 3^{n-1 + 2} = 3^{n+1}. So, 9*3^{n-1} = 3^{n+1}.\n\nWait, but that would mean L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut let me check with n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula is L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, L(n)=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so for n=9, L(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147.

    "text": ". Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check my multiplication again because 3*29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent. So, I think I did that correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I just realized that the original problem is 3 times the entire expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). But in my computation, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if I correctly identified the layers. Wait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: (1+3) = 4. Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) +1 = 3*4 +1 =13. Layer 3: 3*(Layer 2) +1= 3*13 +1=40. Layer 4: 3*(Layer 3) +1=3*40 +1=121. Layer 5: 3*121 +1=364. Layer 6: 3*364 +1=1093. Layer 7: 3*1093 +1=3280. Layer 8: 3*3280 +1=9841. Layer 9: 3*9841 +1=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Wait, but let me count the number of layers to make sure I didn't skip any. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have (1+3(...)), so the number of such layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed as above. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute it in another way. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, comparing both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + (1 + 3B). Therefore, B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 =4: a_1 = A*3^{1} -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. So, 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier terms: For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive relation. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. So, looking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. a_3 =1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B +1. Solving for B: B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have thought of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, perhaps it's a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see: Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost is 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 +3 +9. Next layer:1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27. So, each layer adds another term which is 3^{n} where n increases by 1 each time. So, when we get to the outermost layer, which is layer 9, the expression would be 1 +3 +9 +27 +...+3^9. Wait, but that's not exactly accurate because each layer is 1 +3*(previous sum). Let me see: Let me denote S_n as the sum up to layer n. Then, S_n=1 +3*S_{n-1}. So, S_1=1 +3=4. S_2=1 +3*4=13. S_3=1 +3*13=40. Which is similar to the a_n I had earlier. So, S_n= a_n, and S_9= a_9=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*S_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since S_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then S_9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. So, 3*S_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, another way to compute it is to recognize that the entire expression is (3^{11} -3)/2. Which is 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. So, in mathematical terms, if we denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, the recursion is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. So, assuming L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Simplifying both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire computation using the closed-form formula, I could note that the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, the answer is 88572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. Then, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10}=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this method is more efficient because it avoids computing each layer step by step, especially since the number of layers could be more than nine in similar problems. But in this case, since there are nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's good to know that there's a formula for such nested expressions. So, to recap: The problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and finding the general formula for each layer, I was able to compute the innermost layers and work my way out, ultimately multiplying the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Lp = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the recurrence relation formula, which is much faster, especially if there are more layers. But since in this problem there are nine layers, and I had to compute each one step by step, it worked out. I think I've got it right. Let me just recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the inside out, I arrived at the innermost value of 4, then built each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recursive formula is linear, so we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's see: Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4. Then Layer 2 is a_2=13, etc., up to Layer 9. So, in terms of n, n=1 corresponds to the innermost, and n=9 corresponds to the outermost before multiplying by 3. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this method also leads to the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think both methods confirm the same result, so I don't think I made a mistake. It's always good to check using a different approach to make sure. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this pattern as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each term is 1 + 3*term. Hmm, but it's nested multiple times. Wait, perhaps if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4. Then, a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + particular solution. The particular solution can be found by assuming it's a constant, say P. Plugging into the equation: P = 1 + 3*P => P = 1 + 3P => -2P =1 => P= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result.

Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, starting from L(1) = 4, each subsequent L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = (L(0) - c)/ (1 - a) + c*a^n, where c is a constant. Wait, maybe I should use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 1 + 3, then each layer is a term in a geometric series. Let's see: Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. L_3=1 +3*L_2=1 +3*13=40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n =1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 + 3*C => C =1 +3C => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall, for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1) + a_0*r^{n}, but in this case, a_0 would be 1, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found. Let me try to solve it.\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Wait, but let me check the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses inside the outermost 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the one before the outermost 3. So, when we compute Layer 9 as 29524, then multiply by 3, that's the total expression. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series but with a factor of 3 each time. Let me see if I can model this recursively. Let me denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general form for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a geometric progression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - k*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a solution of a_n = A*k^n. Then, a particular solution can be found. Alternatively, we can solve it iteratively. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 As we saw earlier. So, the pattern is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1=4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches a_1=4. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches a_2=13. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches a_4=121. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, which matches a_5=364. So, yes, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I could recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall: For a recurrence of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, actually, I think the formula is a bit different. Let me try to solve it step by step. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see if we can find a pattern. L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1. Wait, no, L_1 is 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Now, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I can see that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the general term can be expressed as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, the entire expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I can't find any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same answer.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. L3=1 + 3*L2=1 + 39=40. Hmm, this seems like a geometric sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for Ln in terms of n. Let's write down the values:\n\nn: 1, Ln:4\n\nn:2, Ln:13\n\nn:3, Ln:40\n\nn:4, Ln:121\n\nn:5, Ln:364\n\nn:6, Ln:1093\n\nn:7, Ln:3280\n\nn:8, Ln:9841\n\nn:9, Ln:29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524.\n\nI wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each term seems to be 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let's check:\n\nL1=4\n\nL2=3*4 +1=13. Correct.\n\nL3=3*13 +1=40. Correct.\n\nL4=3*40 +1=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 +1, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for Ln.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3Ln-1 =0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Ln= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln= (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9= (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost layer is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the formula for Ln is (3^(n+1)-1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 )= (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88572 as the final answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out for each layer. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P +1. Solving for P: P -3P=1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that matches the previous result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. That's reassuring. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. It's always good to verify the result using different methods to ensure it's correct. So, in summary, by expanding each layer step by step and then confirming with a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I can confidently say the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern in the nested expressions.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. Alternatively, this looks similar to a geometric series or something that could be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, and so on, up to a_9. Then the expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous plus particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is a geometric progression. But since it's only nine layers, computing each step is feasible. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result.

So yes, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, each layer is defined in terms of the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined based on initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L_2 = 13. So, 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's another way to get the same result without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since the problem only had 9 layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad. It's good to know both methods, though. The first method is more straightforward for a small number of layers, but the second method using the formula is better for larger numbers or if we need a general solution.

    "text": ". Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms my previous calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. But I think the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward here. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: Each time I see 1+3(...). Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. Each time we have a 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3(1+3), then the next is 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on until we have 9 layers? Wait, when I counted before, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, each adding another layer. So, in total, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, each time I computed up to Layer 9, which is correct. So, the computation seems right. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

I just need to make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. Let me double-check a couple of the layers. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without going through each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute step by step. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, it's a linear recursion where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p +1 => a_p -3*a_p=1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same answer.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). In this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is solid because I've cross-verified using both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation. It's always good to check with two methods to ensure there are no mistakes.

    "text": ". Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, as we computed. Then each subsequent a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. Wait, because a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 =4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 3. Solving for B: B - 3B = 3 => -2B =3 => B= -3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 =4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4= 3A - 3/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A= (11/2)/3=11/6. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1= (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2= (11/6)*3 - 3/2= (11/2) - 3/2= (11-3)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2= (11/6)*9 - 3/2= (99/6) - 3/2= (33/2) - 3/2=30/2=15. Wait, but earlier I computed a_2 as13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Wait, in my initial computation, a_1 was 4, which corresponds to n=1. Then a_2=13, which is n=2. Let me compute a_2 using the formula: a_2= (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2= (11/6)*9 - 3/2= (99/6) - 3/2= (33/2) - 3/2=30/2=15. But wait, according to my step-by-step computation, a_2 was 13, not 15. So, there's a problem here. That suggests that either my step-by-step computation is wrong, or my formula is incorrect. Let me check my step-by-step again. Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. So a_2=13, but according to the formula, it's 15. Therefore, my formula must be wrong. Let me check my recurrence relation again. I thought the recurrence was a_n=3*a_{n-1}+3, but let me confirm. The expression is a_n=3*(1 + a_{n-1})=3 + 3*a_{n-1}. So yes, that's correct. So, the recurrence is a_n=3*a_{n-1}+3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is B, where B=3*B +3. So, B= -3/2. Therefore, general solution is a_n= A*3^n - 3/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4= A*3 -3/2. So, 3A=4 + 3/2=11/2. Thus, A=11/6. So, a_n= (11/6)*3^n -3/2. But when n=2, a_2= (11/6)*9 - 3/2= (99/6) - 3/2= (33/2) - 3/2=30/2=15. But according to the step-by-step, it's 13. So, something's wrong. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check: The expression is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), so a_n=3*(1 + a_{n-1})=3 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is correct. But when I compute a_2, using the formula, it's 15, but step-by-step it's 13. So, there's a mistake in either the formula or the step-by-step. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on, until the outermost one. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen moving out, each time there's another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear as the innermost expression? Let's count the number of 1+3 in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because the expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)), each nested within the previous one. So, when I computed up to Layer9=29524, that's correct. So, the formula should give me a_9=29524, but according to the formula, a_9= (11/6)*3^9 -3/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9= (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\n11*19683=216,513.\n\n216,513/6=36,085.5.\n\nThen subtract 3/2=1.5.\n\nSo, 36,085.5 -1.5=36,084.\n\nBut according to my step-by-step, a_9=29524, which is different from 36,084. So, clearly, the formula is not matching the step-by-step. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in setting up the recurrence relation. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Therefore, the recurrence is a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}, not a_n=3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, that's a crucial mistake. Let me clarify:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if we define a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I computed Layer1=1+3=4, which is correct. Then Layer2=1 +3*4=13, which is correct. So, the recurrence is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier attempt, I thought the recurrence was a_n=3*(1 +a_{n-1}), which would be a_n=3 +3*a_{n-1}. But that's different from a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, the correct recurrence is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, let's rederive the formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nWait, no, the nonhomogeneous term is 1, so the equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: B -3*B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= A*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2= (3^3 -1)/2= (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches my step-by-step.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3= (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4= (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5= (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6= (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7= (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8= (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula directly, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each layer isn't too bad. However, for someone just starting out, it's easy to get lost in the layers, so taking it step by step is probably the best approach. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again: Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which could save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n=9 because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, the general form for n layers would be a recurrence relation where each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly, which would have saved time instead of computing each layer step by step. But either way, I arrive at the same result. Let me just double-check the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is Layer 3. So the formula works. Therefore, confident that a_9 = 29524, and 3*a_9=88572. I think that's the correct answer. So, to recap, by either expanding each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, I arrived at the same result. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy. Especially when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication or addition, so having a formula to cross-check is helpful. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the nested structure, working from the inside out seems more straightforward. Each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, except the very first step where it's just 1 + 3. So, the pattern is that each layer n is 1 + 3*layer(n-1). Starting from layer 1 as 4, layer 2 as 13, and so on. After computing up to layer 9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula for a geometric progression. The expression inside the outermost parentheses is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...). So, it's a finite geometric series with each term multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time. The general formula for such a series is S = a1*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, it's a bit more complex because each term is 1 + 3*previous term, which isn't exactly a simple geometric series. Alternatively, maybe I can express each layer as a function. Let me define a function f(n) where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to f(9). Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, computing f(9) as we did before, and then multiplying by 3. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for f(n). Let's see. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find f(n). The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form f_p(n) = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: f(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: f(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: f(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

That seems right. Hmm, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help compute this without expanding each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Starting from a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. Maybe there's a closed-form formula for this. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Then substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. So a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. I can try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to solve it as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution P. Plugging into the recurrence: P - 3*P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the innermost expression, which is a_9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before. Alternatively, I can compute 3*a_9 using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get the answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

So Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large (nine layers), computing each step was manageable. I don't see an immediate formula, but perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that for a moment. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So using the recursive formula and then finding a closed-form solution helped confirm that the step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern initially, the step-by-step approach worked just fine. Either way, the answer is the same. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, I arrived at the value of the innermost layer, then multiplied by 3 for each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost expression. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to find a formula, which confirmed the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's say we have a general expression like x = 1 + 3x. Wait, but in our case, each layer is x = 1 + 3y, where y is the next layer. But in this case, since each layer is built from the previous, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. So, for each layer, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I also arrive at the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1=4, L_2=13, L_3=40, and so on. This recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n, and then compute L_9. Let's try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, 3*L_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, the problem is solved.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So it's a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=13, n=3: a3=40, and so on, up to a9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, the problem reduces to computing a9 where a1=4 and a_n=1+3*a_{n-1}. Now, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values we have. For n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9, because there are nine layers. Wait, let me confirm. The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. This method using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.
