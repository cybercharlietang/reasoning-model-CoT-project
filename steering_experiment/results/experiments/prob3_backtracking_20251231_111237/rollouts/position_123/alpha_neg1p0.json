Alternatively, I can think of it as each layer multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The closed-form formula is handy because it allows me to compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work. It's interesting to see how the numbers grow exponentially. Each layer is three times the previous, which means the values increase rapidly.

By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer, resulting in the outermost layer being 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, and then also used a recurrence relation approach to confirm that the innermost layer computes to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost one. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence or directly computing each layer leads us to the final result. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Substitute this result into the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this substitution process for each subsequent layer, resulting in the values: 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n4. The outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the ninth layer: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
