I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence or computing each layer sequentially leads to the same result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm ready to present the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
