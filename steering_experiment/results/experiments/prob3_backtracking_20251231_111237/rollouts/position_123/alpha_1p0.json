Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, starting from 4. So, it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But since we have a closed-form, we can directly compute it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let me try to express a_n in terms of the sum. From the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so expanding this recursively:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term is multiplied by 3, but it's a finite sum. Let me see: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, it seems that a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} ?\n\nWait, no, because a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = 13, which is sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nWait, so in general, a_n = sum from k=0 to n of 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is the same as the closed-form I derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since it's nested, it's actually a geometric series of depth 9. The formula for such a nested expression can be derived as (3^{n} - 1)/2, but in this case, we have an extra factor of 3 at the end, so it becomes 3*(3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, n=9 layers, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer.

But since each term is added once and then multiplied by 3, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward here. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, then each subsequent layer builds upon that, leading up to the 9th layer being 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
