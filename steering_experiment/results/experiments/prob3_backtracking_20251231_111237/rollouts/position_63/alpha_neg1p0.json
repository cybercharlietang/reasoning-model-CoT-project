    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so each layer checks out. I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since the problem is only nine layers deep, computing each one manually isn't too bad. If it were, say, 20 layers, I would definitely look for a pattern or a formula, maybe involving geometric series or recursion. But for nine layers, manual computation is manageable. Just to confirm, let me see if each layer is following a pattern. Let's list the layers and their results:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, yes, that's exactly how it's built. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence, the solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially for larger n. But since I was able to compute each layer manually and get the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Now add them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So that seems right. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation here. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with our step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Let me verify with another method: 29,524 * 3: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Subtract 476 * 3 because 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476*3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but with each term adding 1. Wait, but actually, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me see: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. We can compute a_1 to a_9 as we did before, but maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1) + a_0, but in our case, a_1 = 4, and each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, and then also verified using a recurrence relation formula, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value efficiently, confirming that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.

Let me verify by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and I didn't see any errors in the calculations. So, I think the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about whether there's a formula or pattern for such nested expressions. Let me consider that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which might help in computing it without having to compute each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, except for the constant term. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for layer n=9, the value is 29524, which is exactly what I got when computing step by step. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572, which is consistent.\n\nThis formula approach is much more efficient, especially if there were more layers. It shows that each layer n contributes a term that's exponential in nature, which makes the overall value grow very rapidly. It's fascinating how these nested expressions can lead to such large numbers even with a relatively small number of layers.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series but with a twist because of the addition at each step. The closed-form solution we derived neatly encapsulates this behavior, showing how each term depends exponentially on the number of layers.\n\nIn summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by deriving a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, we arrive at the same result: the final value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of them.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but considering each layer is tripling the previous one and adding 1, it might be correct. Let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Let's denote the innermost expression as x. So, x = 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, the next layer would be y = 1 + 3x. Then z = 1 + 3y, and so on. Each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms: a1 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. To solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer k is (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula to ensure consistency. For layer 1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. Layer 6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. Layer 7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer 8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer 9: (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, everything checks out. Thus, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms each layer's value. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the nth layer is given by \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Looking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThen the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Hmm, maybe not directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of itself, but given that the depth is finite (9 layers), it's probably easier to stick with the step-by-step computation or the recurrence formula.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, so after 9 layers, the expression would be something like 3^10 minus some constant, but I think the recurrence approach was more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, it seems my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. So, yes, 88572 is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Given that a_1 = 4. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, we can find the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} - 3a_n = 0, which has solution a_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 corresponds to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each layer was computed correctly, and the formula confirms the result.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is 88,572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.

So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems a bit high. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems right. Wait, but let me confirm using another method. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but this seems like a recurrence relation. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Assume a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = C.\n\nThen, C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nHmm, that's a negative value, but our terms are all positive. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each term as I did before, step by step, since there are only nine layers. So, as I did earlier, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me list them again:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer. Maybe the expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sum of a geometric series with a multiplier.\n\nWait, let's think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another 1 + 3*something. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^8) + (3^7) + ... + 3^0 ) + something. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe each layer is contributing a term that's 3^n, where n starts from 8 down to 0. Let me see.\n\nWait, considering that the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3 + 1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nSimilarly, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait a minute, this looks like each layer is adding another power of 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, each layer n adds up to 3^{n} terms. So, Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but earlier, I computed Layer 8 as 9841, and Layer 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Hmm, so perhaps there's a formula here.\n\nWait, the sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k is (3^n - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which would be after 9 layers, the sum would be from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. Then, the next layer, which is Layer 9 in the problem, would be 1 + 3*(sum up to 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that formula. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n-1 of r^k is (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So, in this case, r=3, and n=9, so sum = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. So, that's correct for Layer 8, which is the sum up to 3^8. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(sum up to 3^8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the final expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3, but I think the step-by-step approach is more straightforward here.\n\nSo, to recap, I computed each layer from the innermost to the outermost, each time calculating the value by substituting the previous layer's result. Then, I multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final answer. Each step checked out, and the calculations seem correct. I don't see any errors in my computations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think about this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me recall that for an expression like a + r*(a + r*(a + r*(...))), it forms a geometric progression. In this case, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). But starting from the innermost term, which is 1 + 3. So, maybe it's a finite geometric series with n terms, where n is the number of layers. Since there are 9 layers, maybe n=9. Let me try to model this. Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form L_k = a + b*L_{k-1}, the solution is L_k = b^{k} * C + (a)/(1 - b), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, a = 1 and b = 3. So, the homogeneous solution would be L_k^h = C*3^k, and the particular solution would be L_k^p = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when k=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, if I expand the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try to write out the expansion. The innermost term is 1 + 3. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. If I expand all the layers, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to see how many 3s and 1s there are. Each layer adds a 1 and a 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, expanding all the way, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's try to express this as a sum. Each time, you have a 3^k term multiplied by 1, and the number of such terms increases with each layer. Specifically, the expression can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If we expand this, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, no, actually, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Since there are 9 layers, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the total number of terms when fully expanded would be 9 terms of 3^k, where k goes from 0 to 8, but multiplied by 1 each time. Wait, let me think again. The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2. The next one is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. Continuing this way, each layer adds another power of 3. So, by the time we reach Layer 9, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Therefore, Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{9} - 1)/2. Wait, but earlier I had Layer 9 as (3^{10} - 1)/2. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, let's clarify. If Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1, which is sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2, which is sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k. So, Layer n is sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Therefore, Layer 9 would be sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. That's consistent with my earlier result. So, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*(29524) = 88572. Therefore, whether I compute it layer by layer, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think I'm confident enough that this is the correct solution. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the multiple methods all lead to the same result, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me write it down step by step: 4 * 3 = 12: units place is 2, carryover 1. Next digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, carryover 0. Next digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15: write 5, carryover 1. Next digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28: write 8, carryover 2. Next digit (ten-thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from a_1) 9A + B = 13 (from a_2) Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that doesn't match my previous result. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me check again. Wait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n----------\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 7, carry 0  \n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u21925, carry 1  \n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2  \n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928  \nSo the result is 87572. But when I did 29524 \u00d73 as (30000 - 476) \u00d73, I get 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's a discrepancy. So which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 using another method. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3  \n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d73  \n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73  \n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12  \n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 +12=88572. \n\nAh, so the correct result is 88572, which means I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me see where I went wrong. Wait, in my initial digit-by-digit calculation, I think I miscounted the digits. Let me write down the number 29524 correctly and multiply each digit by 3, carrying over as needed:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units place: 4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place:5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place:9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place:2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Wait, but according to the breakdown, it's 88572. So where is the mistake? Let me check the digits of 29524 again. The number is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply each digit by 3:\n\n- 4 (units) \u00d73=12 \u21922, carry 1.\n- 2 (tens) \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0.\n- 5 (hundreds) \u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n- 9 (thousands) \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n- 2 (ten thousands) \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, the number is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units), which is 88572. Wait, but in my initial digit-by-digit calculation, I wrote 87572, which is incorrect. So, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Let me compute 29524 \u00d73 using another method. 29524 \u00d73: 29524 \u00d73 can be thought of as (30000 - 476) \u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches.

Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, so 5 with carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. Let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, so we can solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me try to find a particular solution. Let\u2019s assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = k. Then, substituting into the recurrence: k = 1 + 3k \u21d2 k - 3k = 1 \u21d2 -2k =1 \u21d2 k= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from the equation a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is A*3^n. So, general solution: a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 -1/2 =9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, especially with the exponents. 3^10: 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81, 81*3=243, 243*3=729, 729*3=2187, 2187*3=6561, 6561*3=19683, 19683*3=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 divided by 2 is 29524.5, minus 0.5 is 29524. So, that's correct. Then, 29524*3: 29524*3, as I calculated earlier, is 88572. Let me just do a quick check: 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4? Wait, no, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 +4. So, 20000 + 9000=29000, plus 500=29500, plus 20=29520, plus 4=29524. So, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that checks out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7. 5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, that seems correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, the layers are a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula to compute a_n without calculating each step. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Setting a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60,000; 9000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; +1,500=88,500; +60=88,560; +12=88,572. So, yes, 88,572 is correct. Therefore, the computed value is 88,572.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000. Wait, 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each layer is built upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). That makes sense, and the numbers are growing exponentially, which is why the final result is so large.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is 1 + 3 times the next, it's a bit different. But since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible, even if a bit tedious.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers. Let me recompute a few:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, multiplying the last layer by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3 * 29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the solution is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, etc., each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, for n layers, the value would be a geometric series, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, so each layer is essentially (3^n - 1)/2, but wait, let me check that formula. For a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the closed-form solution can be found as a geometric series. Let me see: The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found. Alternatively, the solution is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for the first few layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but Layer 1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's derive the closed-form solution properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form approach confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer from the inside out, we found each layer's value, leading up to the ninth layer, which was then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution also led us to the same answer. Both methods are valid, and in this case, since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step is manageable.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't spot any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outward, we find each subsequent value until the ninth layer, which is then multiplied by 3.

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them step by step: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think if there's a formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This kind of expression can sometimes be represented using a formula involving powers of 3. Let me try to see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. From above, we have:\n\nL(1) = 4\n\nL(2) = 13\n\nL(3) = 40\n\nL(4) = 121\n\nL(5) = 364\n\nL(6) = 1093\n\nL(7) = 3280\n\nL(8) = 9841\n\nL(9) = 29524\n\nI can see that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, the recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and such relations can often be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's find A and B. Plugging the recurrence into the equation:\n\nL(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1\n\nAssume L(n) = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, L(n-1) = A*3^(n-1) + B\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n3*(A*3^(n-1)) = A*3^n\n\n3*B = 3B\n\nSo, right-hand side becomes A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, A = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier values:\n\nFor n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(L(9)), since the entire expression is 3*(...), where the inner part is L(9)=29524.\n\nSo, 3*(L(9)) = 3*(29524) =88572, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, since L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, then 177144 /2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. Solving this recurrence, we derive a formula for the nth layer, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Applying this formula for n=9 and then multiplying by 3, we arrive at the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x       3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Let me verify that with another method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then, 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 93*3=279; so total is 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,000=9,000; 3*280=840; total 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3(, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the first 3(, then inside that, another 3(, and so on. Let me see: The first layer is 3(...), then inside that is another 3(...), and so on, until the innermost is 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Let's write it out:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\nSo, each time after 1 + 3, there's an opening parenthesis, except the innermost one. So, how many opening parentheses are there? Let's count them: Each \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3( is an opening. So, starting from the first 3(, then inside that, 9 more opening parentheses? Wait, no, let me count the number of 3( after the initial 3. Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\nSo, the initial 3( is the outermost. Then, inside that, the first 1 + 3( is the first layer. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3( until the innermost, which is 1 + 3. So, how many layers is that? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3\n\nWait, so from 1 to 10, but the innermost is the 10th, which is 1 + 3. Then, each layer closes after that. So, the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, that was correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, that should be the final answer. Just to make sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, three layers. Let's compute that manually. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that works. So, my method seems correct. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem, I get 88,572 as the final answer. I think I'm confident with that. So, wrapping it up, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated outward until the ninth layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13  \n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40  \n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121  \n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:  \n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572  \n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Hmm, I think that's the right approach. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the expression is finite with nine layers, computing each step is straightforward. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer (n-1). This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found, but since the number of layers is small, computing each step is manageable. However, just for practice, let's try to find a closed-form expression for Layer n. The recurrence relation is: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer (n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Layer n - 3*Layer (n-1) = 1. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer (n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying: Layer n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: Layer 2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: Layer 3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of layers: Each opening parenthesis is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each 1+3*(...) is a new layer. Let's count how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The initial expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. So, that's 9 layers. Therefore, my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Hmm, let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. The homogeneous part is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, L9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I'm confident with this result now. I didn't make any mistakes in my step-by-step computation, and the recurrence relation approach also led me to the same answer. It's always good to check your work using a different method to ensure accuracy, especially with nested expressions that can get quite large. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. By computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm, that means I made a mistake in my digit-by-digit calculation. Let me check again. Wait, 29524 is the number, right? So 29524 * 3: Let's break it down properly. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the result is 87572. But when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in either the digit-by-digit calculation or the expanded form. Let me check the expanded form again: 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So the expanded form gives 88572, which contradicts the digit-by-digit result of 87572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach. Let me check where I went wrong. Wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So the digits from right to left are 4,2,5,9,2. So when I'm multiplying, I should process them in that order. Let me write it out step by step: 29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the units place (4):\n\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (2):\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit (5):\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (9):\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (2):\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. But the expanded form gives 88572. Wait, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake in either the digit positions or the addition. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29524 as 2 9 5 2 4, so from left to right, it's ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units. So when I multiply by 3, I should process each digit correctly. Let me try again:\n\n2 (ten thousands place) *3 =6, but since it's the leftmost digit, it's just 6.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 +5*100 +2*10 +4*1.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm not correctly aligning the digits when doing the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try writing it out as a multiplication:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x         3\n   -------------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. But when I compute it as 29524*3, using the expanded form, I get 88572. There's a contradiction here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check using another approach, perhaps using a calculator or by adding 29524 three times. Wait, 29524 +29524=59048. Then 59048 +29524=88572. So that confirms that 29524*3=88572. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication was incorrect. I must have miscounted the digits or made a mistake in the alignment. Let me try that again carefully:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nWait, that gives me 87572 again, which contradicts the correct answer of 88572. So where's the mistake? Let me check each step again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29524 as:\n\nDigit positions (from right): 4 (units), 2 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 9 (thousands), 2 (ten thousands).\n\nSo when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0.\n\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15 \u21925, carry1.\n\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n\n- Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds),7 (tens),2 (units), which is 88572. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So I must have made a mistake in the digit positions before. So actually, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was incorrect because I miscounted the digits, perhaps. So, to clarify, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the expanded form, I got 88572, which matches the correct result. So where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit approach? I think I might have miscounted the digits, perhaps misaligning the places. Let me try writing it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572, which is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I was getting 87572, I must have miscounted the digits. So, the correct multiplication gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, going back to the problem, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm all the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(Layer1)=1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I was getting 87572, but that was a miscalculation. So the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again to be absolutely sure. Let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(...), so if Layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...)\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer1, and the outermost is Layer9.\n\nYes, so Layer9 is the outermost expression inside the first set of parentheses, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*(Layer9) again.\n\nLayer9=29524.\n\n3*29524: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3 using the standard multiplication method:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers. Sometimes, when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, each layer is correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I can't find any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step until the outermost expression is reached, then multiplied by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the layers:** The expression has nine nested layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that's different from the digit-by-digit method. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048.

Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1. 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1. 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So that's 59048.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or miscalculate.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since the problem is only nine layers deep, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that for a second. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, we can find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1, which is a nonhomogeneous equation. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because our layers are all positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps using the method for solving linear recurrences. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula holds. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88572.

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me confirm that I computed each layer correctly, because if I made a mistake in any layer, the final answer would be off. Let me go through each layer again step by step to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute it without going through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which is a linear recurrence relation. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients, but since there's a constant term, it's a nonhomogeneous equation. Let me recall the method for solving such recursions. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In our case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is given by a_n = A*r^{n} + (c/(r - 1)), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let me verify that. So, for the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, as Layer 1 is 4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. So, it's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the linear recurrence. But since the problem is presented as a nested expression, computing each layer step by step is also feasible, though time-consuming. Either way, the result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer: 1+3*previous. So, 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2= (177147-3)/2=177144/2=88572. Both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize it as a nested recurrence relation.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go back and compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240=9840. Then Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88,572 as computed earlier. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. We can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88,572 is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric progression with ratio 3, and the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. But in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, the recursive approach seems more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in a base-3 system, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Regardless, both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach lead me to the same result, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The final result is obtained by recognizing the pattern and computing the necessary layers step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Let me go back and check each layer again because if any layer is incorrect, the final answer will be off. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Total 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Total: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive formula. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for the nth layer. Let me see. The recursive relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume Ln^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, I could have directly computed L9 and then multiplied by 3 to get the result without computing each layer individually. That might have saved some time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine, it wasn't too bad. Another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous layer's value and adding 1. So, each time, the value is growing exponentially, which is why the numbers get large so quickly. It's interesting how such a simple recursive relation can lead to such a large number after just a few iterations. I wonder if there's a name for this kind of expression or if it's a known type of problem. Maybe it's similar to a continued fraction or a nested radical, but in this case, it's a nested expression with multiplication and addition. Anyway, I think I've got the problem figured out. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, verified the result using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and arrived at the final answer of 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the ninth layer directly, confirming the result. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next term)}\\). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's consider each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is correct. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let me see: Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I think of each digit in base 3, but since we're adding 1 each time, maybe it's a different representation. However, I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. In any case, both methods lead to the same result, so I can be confident that my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, since it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + particular solution. To find the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think I've approached this correctly, both by step-by-step computation and by finding a general formula for the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I don't think I made a mistake. It's always good to verify with different methods if possible, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can be tricky to compute manually. So, yeah, I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we find the value to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, then subtract 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute layer by layer, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and check each layer computation: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Okay, so each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n represent the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, 3A + B = 4. Now, let's consider the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. If we substitute the general solution into this, we get: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 3A + B = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirmed the result. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step as I did initially would also work, though it's more time-consuming. Either way, the answer is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
