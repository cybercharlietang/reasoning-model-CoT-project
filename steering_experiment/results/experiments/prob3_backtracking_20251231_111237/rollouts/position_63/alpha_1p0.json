    "text": " Wait, 5 is the next digit. So, 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first parenthesis: 1 + 3(...), so that's one layer. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), so that's two layers. Continuing this way, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the 3, there's a (1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first opening parenthesis after 3, each subsequent layer adds another opening parenthesis. Let's count them: The innermost is the last (1+3), which is Layer 1. Then each preceding one adds a layer. So, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then moving out, each time we have another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) - first opening parenthesis\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)) - second layer\n3. And so on until the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1+3 followed by another (, so each ( after 3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after 3:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, then each subsequent ( inside.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is 1+3 with no further nesting, and each layer adds one more. So, Layer 1: 1+3, Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers. So, computing each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but just to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error at any step, let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute it again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each step follows logically, and the multiplications and additions seem correct. So, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I computed Layer 9 correctly because that's where I might have made a mistake.\n\nLet me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3 \u00d7 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the expression, I thought maybe it's a geometric series or something that can be simplified with a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each layer step by step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear function. Let me try to model this.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, which is Layer 9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, a_9 was 29524. Let's compute (3^{10} - 1)/2:\n\n3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier result. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me just verify 3^10 is indeed 59049. Let me compute 3^1 through 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly because the initial condition was a_1 = 4, which is Layer 1. So, when n = 1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches Layer 2. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works, and thus the final result is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use the formula, and just computed each layer step by step, I still arrived at 88572. So, that's reassuring.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually again.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. Each time I'm computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). But in the original problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the way I approached it, computing each layer and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3 is correct, right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n =3a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nThen, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 +3*A => A =1 +3A => 0=1 +2A => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer, starting from n=1, a_1=4, which matches (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches. So, this formula works.\n\nSince the original problem has 9 layers, let's see: Wait, how many layers do we have? Let me count again.\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds one more layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that would mean n=9 layers. Wait, but in my previous calculation, I had a_9=29524, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me check that.\n\n3^{10}=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same as before. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I don't see any mistakes now. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a general formula for the nth term. Both methods led me to the same result, so that gives me confidence in the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. By computing each layer sequentially, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result.

    "text": " Wait, 5 is the next digit? Wait, 29524: positions are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: Units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.

Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to compute it without manually calculating each layer, which could save time, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give me a closed-form expression, which could help compute the value without iterating through each layer, especially useful for a larger number of layers. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A, where A is a constant to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which is handy. But since I was able to compute each layer manually and verify with the formula, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute the value step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find a closed-form expression to compute the value efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since the numbers are manageable, computing each layer step by step seems straightforward. Another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple case, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger n. But since in this case, n=9 isn't too large, both methods work. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a linear recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recursive formula a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4, we find that the nth term is given by a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Thousands place: 8, carry over 2. Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me cross-verify my earlier steps because 3*(Layer 9) is 3*29524=88572. But let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting again, maybe I made a mistake in calculating one of the layers. Let me go step by step through each layer to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I'm feeling a bit uncertain because the numbers are growing so rapidly. Let me check another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9, then each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall: For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, it's similar to a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Comparing to the general form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, here k=3 and c=1. The initial condition is L1 = 4, as we computed earlier. So, the solution to the recurrence would be L(n) = 3^{n} * L0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but in our case, L1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me define L(1) = 4, L(2) = 13, etc. So, the recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The general solution for such a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies L(n) = 3*L(n-1). Its solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L(9), and L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. Then, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3 again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's not the right way to break it down because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Correct. So, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, 5 is the tens place? Wait, no, wait: 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, starting from units: 4*3=12, carryover 1.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.

Then, 3*29524=88572. So, the answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...), right? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3(...), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. So, starting after the first 3(, each 1+3( adds a layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is followed by a closing parenthesis except the innermost one. Wait, maybe it's better to count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3(...), which is Layer 1. Then, moving outward, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see how many times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first \"1+3\" is Layer 1: 1+3. Then, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8)\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(Layer6)\n\n...\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(Layer8), where Layer8 is 1+3*(Layer7), and so on until Layer1=1+3.\n\nSo, in total, how many layers? Let's see: Starting from Layer1 to Layer9, each Layer is 1 +3*(previous Layer). So, 9 layers in total, each adding another 1 +3*(...). So, when I computed up to Layer9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3)...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 =1 +3, a_2=1 +3*a1, a3=1+3*a2, etc., up to a9. Then, the total expression is 3*a9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help. Let me see if this is a geometric series or something else. Let me write out the first few terms:\n\na1 =1 +3=4\n\na2=1 +3*4=13\n\na3=1 +3*13=40\n\na4=1 +3*40=121\n\na5=1 +3*121=364\n\na6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nHmm, the sequence goes 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524.\n\nLooking at this sequence, each term is 1 +3*previous term.\n\nSo, a_n = 1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1}=A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B =1 +3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 +3*A*3^{n-1} +3*B =1 +A*3^n +3B\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight-hand side: 1 +A*3^n +3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B =1 +A*3^n +3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB =1 +3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B =1 => B= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n =A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1=4.\n\na1 = A*3^1 -1/2 =3A -1/2 =4\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(729-1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, checked each computation, and then found a general formula to confirm the result.

    "text": " Wait, 5 is in the hundreds place. 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So writing it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. It might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recursive relation is: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 1. The homogeneous equation is: Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is Layer_h(n) = A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution, Layer_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is Layer(n) = Layer_h(n) + Layer_p(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, Layer(1) = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So Layer(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: Layer(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So in our problem, we have 9 layers. So Layer(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer(9))=3*29524=88572. So that's the final answer. Alternatively, since Layer(n) = (3^(n+1)-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer(9))=3*(3^10 -1)/2. Compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication one more time: 29524 *3. Let's compute 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, all steps check out, and the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the formula for the nth layer, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. This forms a recursive pattern.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1), compute each subsequent layer using the formula:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognize that each layer follows the formula Layer(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For Layer 9:\n   - Layer(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, writing it all together: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, but that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct).

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait, is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think if there's a formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n=9 layers inside the outermost 3. Wait, but in our problem, the outermost term is 3*(...), so the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1), and so on up to Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3. So, actually, the number of layers is 9, but the outermost multiplication by 3 is separate. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, in this case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, to find a_9, we can compute it step by step as I did before, but perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula for a_n using the recurrence relation gives me confidence that the value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, we find it equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then I multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.\n\nWait, let me retrace the layers step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times we have 3(...).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1+3)\n2. 3(1+3(1+3))\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, I think. Wait, let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses. From the end:\n\n- The innermost is (...)), so each layer adds a closing parenthesis. Let me see, starting from the end:\n\nThe last part is (1+3)), so that's two closing parentheses. Wait, no, let me parse it correctly.\n\nActually, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another set of parentheses. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3(1 + 3(...)). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there in total?\n\nLooking at the original expression, let's count the number of times we have \"3(\" before the first \"1+\".\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after 3, we have a new opening parenthesis. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n...\nWait, perhaps it's easier to just note that each layer is a 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3*(...)), and each time, we have one more layer. So, if I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one.\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then my computation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then I multiply by 3 to get the final answer. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the multiplication step. 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify by another method. Let's break down 29,524 into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correctly computed. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression starts with 3*(...), so the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut since L_1 = 4, let's compute a few terms to see the pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps it's overcomplicating since we've already computed each layer step by step, and the answer seems consistent. But for thoroughness, let me check if a formula can be applied.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So, putting it together: 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me try computing the layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Simple enough. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. So, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I've computed this correctly. The key was to work from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step. It might seem tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable. I didn't try to compute all layers at once, which could have led to mistakes. Instead, I handled each one sequentially, ensuring that each step was correct before moving on to the next. This systematic approach helped prevent errors and made the problem solvable. So, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check again.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see if there's a recursive formula or something. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L(n) - 3L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p = 1 + 3L_p => Subtract 3L_p both sides: -2L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3 =4. Then, each subsequent layer goes up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

    "text": " Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it as 29,524. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.

So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Maybe I should go through each layer again to confirm. Let's recount each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 (Wait, 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 (Correct) Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 (As computed earlier) So, that seems consistent. I think I did each step correctly. Another way to think about this is that each layer is following the pattern: each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote each term as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yeah, that seems right. I can also try to see if there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, using the closed-form formula, I still get the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the nesting is only nine layers deep, computing each layer step by step might be the most straightforward method, even though it's a bit tedious. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using recursion. The expression seems to be of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the sequence is defined recursively by a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, starting from a_1 = 4. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_{n+1} = c*a_n + d. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c - 1). Plugging in the values: a_n = (4 - 1/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3 - 1) = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Therefore, a_9 = (7/2)*3^{8} + 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^8 is 6561. So, (7/2)*6561 = (7*6561)/2. Let me compute 7*6561: 6561 * 7: 6000*7=42000, 500*7=3500, 60*7=420, 1*7=7. So, 42000 + 3500 = 45500; 45500 + 420 = 45920; 45920 + 7 = 45927. So, (7*6561)/2 = 45927/2 = 22963.5. Then, adding 1/2: 22963.5 + 0.5 = 22964. Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, Layer 9 was 29524, which is different from 22964. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, something must be wrong here. Let me check my formula. The general solution for a linear recurrence a_{n+1} = c*a_n + d is a_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c - 1). Wait, but in this case, a_1 is 4, c=3, d=1. So, substituting, a_n = (4 - 1/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3 - 1) = (4 - 1/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (7/2)*3^8 + 1/2. As I computed earlier, that's (7/2)*6561 + 1/2. But 7/2 * 6561 is 45927/2 = 22963.5, and adding 1/2 gives 22964. But when I computed step by step, I got a_9 as 29524. So, clearly, something is wrong here. Maybe my formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The formula for a linear recurrence a_{n+1} = c*a_n + d is indeed a_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c - 1). But wait, in our case, the recursion is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar but not exactly the same as the standard form. Let me re-examine the indexing. If I define a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is correct. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, to find a general formula, we can use the method for solving linear recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recursion: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Ah, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation! So, earlier, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula. I think I confused the indexing. When I used the formula earlier, I thought a_n was defined as a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, but in reality, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the indexing is different. Therefore, the correct formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous result. So, that confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct, and the formula also leads to the same result once properly applied. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572. I think I've got it now. The key was to recognize the recursive pattern and either compute each layer step by step or derive a closed-form formula using the method for solving linear recursions. Both approaches led me to the same answer, which gives me confidence in the correctness of the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is defined as \\( a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By recursively calculating each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the innermost expression and then multiply by 3. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we determine \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Wait, 5 is the third digit from the right. So, 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 (from the 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048.\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was the result of 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I could recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from 1, each time we're doing 1 + 3*something. That looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this as a recurrence. Let me denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer was a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer is built by adding another 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have 9 layers in total, from a_1 to a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this method also confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Wait, 5 is in the hundreds place, so 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000? Wait, 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. So adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Let me verify that step-by-step computation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me list each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers, which is a bit tedious. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined recursively. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see if the sequence a_n follows a particular pattern. Let's list the a_n values: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 13 a_3 = 40 a_4 = 121 a_5 = 364 a_6 = 1,093 a_7 = 3,280 a_8 = 9,841 a_9 = 29,524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps I can find a formula for a_n without computing each term step by step. The standard approach for solving linear recurrence relations of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute the entire expression using the formula, I could express it as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, 3^{11}=177,147. Then, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. That's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I can compute the answer directly without computing each layer. That might be faster, especially if there are more layers. But for n=9, it's manageable either way. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and deriving a formula for the nth layer, I was able to compute the value efficiently. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense, and I've verified it through multiple methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and direct formula. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result without computing each layer manually. That's a bit more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But for 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I'm getting confused because I'm writing it out in my head. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, that seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I let x be the value of the innermost expression, then each layer is 1 + 3x, where x is the next layer. But in this case, since it's nested nine times, maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I can compute 3^10 directly as 59049, then compute (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This kind of expression can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's another way to see it, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula. This might have saved some computation time, especially if the expression had more layers. But for nine layers, both methods worked fine. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together, the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe I can see a pattern in the layers. Let me list the layers again with their values:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check:\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 to 13. 3*4 +1 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 2 to Layer 3: 13*3 +1 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 3 to Layer 4: 40*3 +1 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that works. So, the nth layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, using the recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times ...))))).\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*next_layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nAs I found before, each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, for layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's a finite geometric series, so the formula applies.\n\nBut perhaps I can think of the expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the expression is a finite nested multiplication, the formula I found using the recurrence is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the initial step-by-step computation of each layer.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524. Correct.\n\n3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. We compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.\n\nThe problem is: Compute \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\).\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this with a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. Plugging into the formula: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A is zero. But in our case, since each a_n is finite, we can consider the steady-state solution. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation step by step. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, but that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step to verify each layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, non-homogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524=88572. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, 5 is in the hundreds place? Wait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 units. So, starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 (ten thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me check a couple of layers again to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or a formula. The expression is a nested multiplication where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me consider the general form. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see: If we assume a steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = c, then c = 1 + 3c => c - 3c = 1 => -2c = 1 => c = -1/2. So, the particular solution is a_n = -1/2 + homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution A*3^n. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method also gives us the same result, which reinforces that our initial step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, recognizing that each a_n is following a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 3 times the previous plus 1. This is a standard linear recurrence, and the formula we derived is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer until the outermost one, which is then multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and recognizing the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, writing it all together: 8, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, let me check that again because I think I messed up the order. Let's write it out properly:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n     *       3\n     -----------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Let me double-check my multiplication because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer to make sure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute this again carefully.\n\n3*29524: Let's do it step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 88572 as well. So that's correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because when I did the digit-by-digit, I thought I made a mistake, but it seems correct.\n\nWait, let me check 29524 * 3 once more:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStart from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the addition, I thought I had 88572, which matches the multiplication. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLet me list all the layers again with their computed values:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form solution\u2014we arrive at the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: As above, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses, I computed each layer step by step, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. I did this nine times, each time getting a larger number, and then finally multiplied the outermost result by 3 again. So, the steps were: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Let me just check one of the layers to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. All right, so after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I think that's it. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it step by step made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, indeed, 88572. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Let me check 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L(9), would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L(9) = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my layers because if I made a mistake in one of them, the entire result will be off. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems right. So I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions, but since I don't recall one immediately, working step by step seems safe. Let me just consider if this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see: The recursion is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We have one equation, but two unknowns. To find another equation, let's compute L2 using the recurrence: L2 = 3*L1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Using the general solution: L2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) 9A + B = 13 (from n=2) Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, and then I even derived a formula to confirm that the layer 9 value was correct. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me double-check my computations for each layer because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, so it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, the value is a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 0.5: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, that's consistent with our earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and work our way out. After computing each layer, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and recognizing the recurrence relation, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly because if I messed up one layer, the subsequent ones would be wrong. Let me recount each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, just to make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: a1=1+3=4. a2=1+3*a1=1+3*4=13. a3=1+3*a2=1+3*13=40. a4=1+3*a3=1+3*40=121. a5=1+3*a4=1+3*121=364. a6=1+3*a5=1+3*364=1093. a7=1+3*a6=1+3*1093=3280. a8=1+3*a7=1+3*3280=9841. a9=1+3*a8=1+3*9841=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Alternatively, perhaps this sequence can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let's solve it: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: a1= C*3^1 -1/2=3C -1/2=4. So, 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms: For n=1: a1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without computing each layer step by step. That's reassuring. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, perhaps I can compute 3^10 and see: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost expression and then compute the final result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers, so we'll compute each from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognize the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a1=4. Solving this gives a formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For Layer 9 (n=9), a9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

I think I did it right. So, the value of the expression is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can help verify the result. Looking at the expression, it's a repeated application of 1 + 3*(previous term). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082, and so on up to a\u2089. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089. So, if I can find a formula for a\u2099, that might help. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a\u2099.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation: a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can use the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 \u21d2 -2*C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a\u2081 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3\u00b9\u2070: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572, which matches my earlier result. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the characteristic equation method confirms that the result is indeed 88,572. This gives me more confidence that my initial step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is by recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, so it's similar to a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But since the series is finite (only 9 layers), the closed-form approach as above is more straightforward.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with exponents, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is indeed 59049. So, subtracting 1 gives 59048, and dividing by 2 gives 29524. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form solution give the same result. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.
