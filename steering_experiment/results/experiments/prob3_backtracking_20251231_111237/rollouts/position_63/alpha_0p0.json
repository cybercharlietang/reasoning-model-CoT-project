Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do arithmetic in my head, I might make a mistake. Let me verify each step again. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it another way. Alternatively, I can note that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think I've double-checked each step, so I'm pretty sure that's correct. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer and then verifying with a general formula helped solidify that the answer is right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers.

Just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since I only have nine layers, computing each step is manageable. However, for the sake of understanding, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed before. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my computations, and the closed-form formula corroborates the step-by-step result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So yes, the result is 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it might form a geometric progression. Let me see: If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. So, let's see: Let me adjust the formula. Let me set n=9, since we have 9 layers. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. So, the general formula for a_n where n starts at 1 would be a_n = 3^n - 1. Wait, let me check: For n=1, a_1 = 4, which is 3^1 + 1? Wait, 3^1 = 3, 3 + 1 = 4. Hmm, that works. For n=2, a_2 = 13. 3^2 + 3^1 + 1? Wait, 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. Yes, that works. For n=3, 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1? 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40. Correct. So, the general formula seems to be a_n = sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I got before. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of the geometric series directly, but since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each layer step by step was manageable. But for longer expressions, using the formula would be more efficient. So, to recap: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) which simplifies to 3*a_9, where a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I write the digits from right to left, it's 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the order. Let me try writing it properly. Let's write 29524 as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiply each digit by 3 from right to left:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the digits from right to left are 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that can't be because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be 5 digits as well. Wait, no, 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is a 5-digit number. Wait, but when I write the digits from right to left, it's 2,7,5,8,8, which would be 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me check this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try expanding the expression a bit more formally. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where a\u2081 = 1 + 3, then a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082, and so on up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers. Then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nSo, let's compute each a_i:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without having to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each a_i is defined by a recurrence relation: a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a\u2081 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, so maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_i. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_i = A*3^{i} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, the standard form is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_i^h = C*3^i, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_i^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_i = C*3^i - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier:\n\nFor i=1: a\u2081 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor i=2: a\u2082 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor i=3: a\u2083 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor i=4: a\u2084 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we're dealing with a\u2089, that would be:\n\na\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I applied the formula correctly. The formula gives a_i as (3^{i+1} - 1)/2, so for i=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*a\u2089, where a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, so the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3 = 177147.\n\nThus, the expression becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step, verifying with a formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous term})\\).

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together: 8 (from 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3+1), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that seems a bit confused. Let me do it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15.

Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 8 (ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the digits should be in the correct places. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the places. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry over 0.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Wait, that can't be right because the digits should correspond to the correct place values. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the number is 29,524. So when multiplying by 3, each digit is processed as follows:\n\n- Units digit: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572.

Let me check:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n- 500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n- 20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, that matches. So 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29,524, and then I multiply by 3 to get the final answer, which is 88,572. So that would be the result of the entire expression.\n\nBut let me double-check my layer computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29,524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88,572. Let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer, which would be the outermost one before the initial 3.\n\nSo, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, giving us 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a formula or a recursive relation.\n\nEach layer n is defined as Layer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is: Layer(n) = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1, with Layer(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is Layer(n) = 3*Layer(n-1), whose solution is Layer(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition Layer(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Layer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer(9) =3 *29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * Layer(9), we can write it as:\n\n3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify to use a formula, and given that it's a one-time computation, breaking it down layer by layer is acceptable.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n3. Compute up to the ninth layer, which gives 29,524.\n\n4. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After calculating up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms our earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, each layer checks out with the formula. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, ensuring each multiplication and addition was correct. 3. Derive a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to confirm the result. 4. Verify each step and the final multiplication to ensure accuracy. It's a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down layer by layer and using a formula to confirm helps prevent errors. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think the answer is solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let's see, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. So, the 9th term is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Let's also compute a_2 to set up another equation. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula, a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B. So, now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) 9A + B = 13 (from n=2) Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. I computed each layer step by step up to the 9th layer, which gave me 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get 88572. Additionally, I verified the result using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, which also gave me 29524 for the 9th layer, leading to the same final answer. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is calculated by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 to obtain the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me verify my steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if there are more layers. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. It's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a direct formula without computing each layer. Let me think. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and we have 9 layers, starting from Layer 1=4. Wait, but using the formula, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, starting from the innermost, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, you're adding another term. So, perhaps this is a geometric series with ratio 3, but I'm not sure. Let me try expanding the entire expression. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let's define E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Alternatively, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we can find E_9 directly.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1 over 2, which is 59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this method confirms the result I got earlier by step-by-step computation. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this without computing each layer. Let me think about it. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3(...), which is similar to a geometric series but with a twist. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, if you have n layers, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), n times. In this case, n=9 layers inside the outermost 3. But since we've already found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or manipulate the expression using properties of exponents, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$ with $a_1 = 4$.

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry 1. 9 + 9 = 18 +1=19, write down 9, carry 1. 2 + 2=4 +1=5. So that's 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 8 +4=12, write 2, carry 1. 4 +2=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 0 +5=5, write 5. 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8, write 8. So that gives 88572. Yep, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started from the innermost parentheses, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29524. Then I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is just a linear function applied repeatedly, so the numbers grow pretty quickly, which is why the final result is so large. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few layers again to check. Let's go through layers 1 to 3 again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572. All the steps check out.

Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, so that's different from the digit-by-digit method. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me do it again carefully: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 8 (from the 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 5, then 7, then 2. So that's 88572. Wait, but when I did it the other way, I got 88572 as well. Wait, earlier when I thought I had a different result, I must have miscalculated. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me verify the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recursion. Let's see. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. That's a good check. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using a formula approach confirms the result. \n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem, the expression is 3*(...), where the innermost part is 1 + 3, so that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). Therefore, layer 9 is a_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute a_9: (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost expression is 29524.

Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that could be generalized, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step seems manageable. Alternatively, if I think about each layer as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a formula for it. Let's consider that each layer n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence would be a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a geometric series. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, which for a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1 is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.

So, writing it all together: 8 (from the first digit), then 8, 7, 5, 2. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer. Looking at the expression: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the outermost layer being 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me retrace my steps to ensure each layer was computed correctly. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute one layer at a time again. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equating the terms: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of the closed-form formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues up to Layer 9, which equals 29524. Finally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total. So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. But since the problem didn't specify using a formula, just computing it, the step-by-step approach is probably what's expected. So, to recap, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is built by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, which is 29,524, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recursive approach, each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. After calculating up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the ninth layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify that: 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I compute each layer correctly? Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that could represent this. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, layer n has the value (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then we multiply by 3 as per the original expression. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yes, same result. So, using the formula, it's much faster and less error-prone. I think that's a better approach, especially for larger numbers of layers. It's always good to recognize patterns and find a general formula to avoid repetitive calculations. So, in summary, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I found that each layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, directly computing using the formula for the entire expression gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 =88572. Either way, the answer is the same. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer (n=9), the value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. But wait, I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can help compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. Let's try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when I compute layers, I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's count them: 3( ... ) where the innermost is 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each time, there's a new ( before the 1. So, the expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, layers 1 to 9, as I did before. So, 9 layers, and I computed each correctly. Therefore, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n800 * 3 = 2400\n40 * 3 = 120\n1 * 3 = 3\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29524 * 3: As before, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. Since we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3, that would mean we compute up to a_9, then multiply by 3. Wait, no, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(...), and the innermost is a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9 where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. Therefore, A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the closed-form formula, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations because that seems like a lot of steps. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is what I did earlier. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. If we have nine layers, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n in this recurrence relation. Let me try to find it. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution also leads to the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the formula for a geometric series. But in this case, since it's nested, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), so each term is one more than three times the previous term. So, if I have nine layers, each one building on the previous, it's a matter of computing each step. Either way, whether I compute each layer manually or use the recurrence relation, I end up with the same final result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. 3. After computing the innermost nine layers, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 4. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation, find a closed-form solution, and compute the result that way. Both methods led to the same answer, so I feel confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to verify. Let me think about this. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote the value of Layer n as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We have a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider a_0, it would be 1 + 3*a_{-1}, but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, since it's a first-order linear recurrence, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*a_9, where a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=(177144)/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which is much faster and reduces the chance of error. I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a pattern, we can efficiently find the solution using a recurrence relation. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000? Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I first broke down 29,524 * 3, I got 88,572, which seems correct. So, maybe my initial confusion was unwarranted. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Since 3^10 is 59,049, so a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can express this recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: As before, let's compute 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrive at the final result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right result for this problem.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step seems correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.
