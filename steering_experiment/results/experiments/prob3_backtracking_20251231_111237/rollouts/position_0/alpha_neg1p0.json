    "text": " It's a bit of a long expression, so I need to take it step by step. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, so let me try to parse this. It looks like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. So starting from the innermost part, each time it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Since it's nested multiple times, I think I'll need to compute it from the inside out. Let me count how many layers there are here.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. From the expression, it's 9 opening parentheses, so that means there are 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me check again. Each time it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time we go out, it's another 1+3(...). So let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next layer: 1+3*(previous result)\n3. Then another layer: 1+3*(previous result)\n4. And so on, until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the original problem, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, but looking at the original problem, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so the total number of layers is 9 because each time we add a layer, we go from 1+3 to 1+3*(1+3), etc., and the expression has 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So maybe it's 9 layers. Alternatively, perhaps it's 8 layers because the initial 3*(1+...) is the outermost, and then each inner is a layer. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen,\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until L9.\n\nThen the final result is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but looking at the original expression, it's 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))). So maybe L1 is 1+3, L2 is 1+3*L1, L3 is 1+3*L2, etc., and the outermost is 3*L9, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me see.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))). So each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3*(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3*(...), the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So the number of layers inside the outermost 3*(...) is 9, because each time you go one layer deeper, you add another 1+3*(...). So that would mean that there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So perhaps I should compute each layer step by step from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression first.\n\nCompute L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(L9). So the final result is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n3*4=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n3*2=6 +1=7.\n\n3*5=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n3*9=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n3*2=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))). So starting from the innermost 1+3, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(...). Each 1+3*(... adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of 1+3*(... expressions. Let me write them out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), which includes 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So that would mean that L1 is 1+3, L2 is 1+3*L1, up to L9, and then the outermost is 3*L9. So yes, that's 9 layers inside the 3*(...).\n\nSo my calculation should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the final result again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here, but given that it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, another approach: each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each layer can be thought of as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for L_n. Since L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L1=4, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nSo when n=1, L1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9,\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, L9=29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nThus, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524*3:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe final result is obtained by multiplying \\( L_9 \\) by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me write it down to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of layers! It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can solve it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses are (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1 + 3) is 4. Now, I'll replace that innermost part with 4. The next layer out is 3 times that result. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 4 = 12.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me check again. The structure is 3(1 + something). So, the innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer is 3 times that 4, so 3*4=12. But actually, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result). Wait, no, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*...).\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), layer 2 is the next one out, and so on until layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nLet me start with layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving to layer 2: It's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, no, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, for layer 2, it's 3*(1 + 3*(layer 1 result)).\n\nWait, no, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(layer 1)). Wait, but layer 1 is 4, so layer 2 would be 3*(1 + 3*4). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute 3*4: that's 12. Then add 1: 12 + 1 = 13. Then multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each step is 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)). So, perhaps I can model this as a recursive process where each step depends on the previous one.\n\nWait, let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nWait, that's getting big quickly. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3).\n\nThen, moving outward, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3 and a set of parentheses. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that starting from the innermost, there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, I need to compute 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I only got to layer 4, so maybe I should continue.\n\nBut before I proceed, let me confirm if my approach is correct. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*(1 + 3*previous result). Wait, no, that's not quite accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nWait, that seems correct so far. Let me continue.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, that seems really large. Let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704. Wait, 9567 + 1 is 9568, times 3 is 28,704. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me check again because this seems like a very large number, and sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make an off-by-one error or miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I have the correct number.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nAnd then each corresponding closing parenthesis. So, there are 9 layers in total. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n represents the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent term a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)). Wait, that's different. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model it as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 3*(1 + 3*a_2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}).\n\nThis recurrence relation can be written as a_n = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}) = 3*1 + 3*3*a_{n-1} = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 9*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 9 = 0, so r = 9. So, the homogeneous solution is A*9^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 9*C + 3.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 9C = 3 => -8C = 3 => C = -3/8.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*9^n + (-3/8).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*9^1 - 3/8 = 9A - 3/8 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n9A = 4 + 3/8 = 32/8 + 3/8 = 35/8.\n\nThus, A = (35/8) / 9 = 35/(8*9) = 35/72.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nSimplify (35/72)*9^n: since 9^n = 9*9^{n-1}, but perhaps it's better to write it as (35/72)*9^n.\n\nAlternatively, note that 9^n = 3^{2n}, but perhaps that's not necessary here.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8.\n\nFirst, compute 9^9:\n\n9^1 = 9\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n9^4 = 6561\n\n9^5 = 59049\n\n9^6 = 531441\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\n9^8 = 43046721\n\n9^9 = 387420489\n\nSo, 9^9 = 387,420,489.\n\nNow, compute (35/72)*387,420,489.\n\nFirst, compute 387,420,489 divided by 72:\n\n387,420,489 \u00f7 72.\n\nLet me compute this division step by step.\n\n72 \u00d7 5,000,000 = 360,000,000.\n\nSubtracting from 387,420,489: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489.\n\nNow, 72 \u00d7 380,000 = 27,360,000.\n\nSubtracting: 27,420,489 - 27,360,000 = 60,489.\n\nNow, 72 \u00d7 840 = 60,480.\n\nSubtracting: 60,489 - 60,480 = 9.\n\nSo, total is 5,000,000 + 380,000 + 840 = 5,380,840, with a remainder of 9.\n\nSo, 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 = 5,380,840 with a remainder of 9, which is 5,380,840 + 9/72 = 5,380,840 + 1/8 = 5,380,840.125.\n\nNow, multiply by 35:\n\n35 \u00d7 5,380,840.125.\n\nLet me compute 35 \u00d7 5,380,840 = 5,380,840 \u00d7 35.\n\nCompute 5,380,840 \u00d7 30 = 161,425,200.\n\nCompute 5,380,840 \u00d7 5 = 26,904,200.\n\nAdding together: 161,425,200 + 26,904,200 = 188,329,400.\n\nNow, compute 35 \u00d7 0.125 = 4.375.\n\nSo, total is 188,329,400 + 4.375 = 188,329,404.375.\n\nNow, subtract 3/8 from this value.\n\n3/8 = 0.375.\n\nSo, 188,329,404.375 - 0.375 = 188,329,404.\n\nWhich matches the result I obtained earlier by step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify once more to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the division and multiplication steps.\n\nGiven that 9^9 is 387,420,489, and 35/72 times that is indeed (35 \u00d7 387,420,489)/72.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute (35 \u00d7 387,420,489) \u00f7 72.\n\nCompute 35 \u00d7 387,420,489:\n\nFirst, 387,420,489 \u00d7 35 can be computed as:\n\n387,420,489 \u00d7 30 = 11,622,614,670\n\n387,420,489 \u00d7 5 = 1,937,102,445\n\nAdding them together: 11,622,614,670 + 1,937,102,445 = 13,559,717,115.\n\nNow, divide 13,559,717,115 by 72.\n\nLet me perform this division:\n\n72 \u00d7 188,329,404 = ?\n\nCompute 72 \u00d7 188,329,404:\n\nFirst, 188,329,404 \u00d7 70 = 13,183,058,280\n\n188,329,404 \u00d7 2 = 376,658,808\n\nAdding them: 13,183,058,280 + 376,658,808 = 13,559,717,088.\n\nNow, 13,559,717,088 is 72 \u00d7 188,329,404.\n\nBut the numerator is 13,559,717,115, which is 13,559,717,115 - 13,559,717,088 = 27 more.\n\nSo, 13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72 = 188,329,404 with a remainder of 27.\n\nSo, 13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72 = 188,329,404 + 27/72 = 188,329,404 + 3/8 = 188,329,404.375.\n\nThen, subtracting 3/8 (which is 0.375) gives 188,329,404.\n\nYes, that confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, after computing step by step and verifying with a closed-form solution, the final result is 188,329,404.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying 3 by the sum of 1 and the result of the next layer. Through step-by-step computation or using a recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 188,329,404.\n\n$\\boxed{188329404}$"

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. The problem is: \n\nCompute \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one at a time without getting lost in the complexity. So, let's identify where the innermost part is. \n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost parentheses seem to be the last one: (1 + 3). So, let me start there. \n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression now becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check that. The innermost was the last (1 + 3), so replacing that with 4, so the expression is now one level up. Let me make sure I did that correctly.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nAfter replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, the next level becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in identifying the innermost part. Let me count the number of opening and closing parentheses to ensure I'm starting at the correct point.\n\nLooking at the original expression, the number of opening and closing parentheses is the same, so each opening has a corresponding closing. Let me count from the end.\n\nStarting from the end, the first closing parenthesis is after the last 3, so that's (1 + 3). Then, each opening parenthesis before that corresponds to each closing one. So, there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with 1 + 3(...). \n\nWait, no, actually, each time you have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...). Let me try to parse this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to write down each level step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1 to Level 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 9) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 7)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 1.\n\nWait, that might be a clearer way to approach it. So, each level is computed based on the previous one.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Level 1), right? Because the outermost is 3 multiplied by (1 + ...).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify the structure.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, each level is inside the next. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 1) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Level 1 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I computed Level 1 as 29524, that was already 1 + 3*(Level 2). So, the outermost 3 is multiplying that entire expression. Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the original expression, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: \n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2\n\nWait, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo, let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nBut let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Level 9 again: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: as computed earlier, 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here.\n\nLooking at each level, each time we're computing 1 + 3*(previous level). This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nIf we denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we can see how this progresses.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 is the innermost, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^{n} + B\n\nRHS: A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nTherefore, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n levels, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 levels, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms the result using a different method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one level up:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext level:\n\n1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with both methods.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, perhaps I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(...)) directly, step by step, without using the level approach.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nCompute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, the next one is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, finally, 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, and I need to compute the value step by step. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that looks complicated with all those nested 1 + 3s. Let me try to break it down. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can handle each part one at a time without getting lost.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one level out, I have another (1 + 3), but wait, I just computed the innermost one as 4. So, the next level is 1 + 3(4). Hmm, no, actually, let me check again. Wait, the structure is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). So, starting from the inside, each time I compute the innermost expression, then plug it into the next level.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Maybe I can represent each level as a step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me number them from 1 to 9 because there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...), and then multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, but I think I might be getting ahead of myself. Let me try to do it step by step, maybe writing down each level as I go along.\n\nLet me write down each level as a separate step:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, but I think I might be confusing the levels here. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each level is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(next level)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, moving one level out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(4)).\n\nSo, Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nWait, that seems correct so far. Let me check Level 3 again. So, Level 2 was 39, so Level 3 would be 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. That seems right.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nWait, 3*354 is 1062, plus 1 is 1063, times 3 is 3189. Okay, moving on.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 4)) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nWait, 3*3189 is 9567, plus 1 is 9568, times 3 is 28704. Okay, that's Level 5.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 5)) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339\n\nHmm, let me verify that. 3*28704 is 86112, plus 1 is 86113, times 3 is 258339. Okay, that's Level 6.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 6)) = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054\n\nWait, 3*258339 is 775017, plus 1 is 775018, times 3 is 2325054. That's Level 7.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 7)) = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489\n\nWait, let me check that. 3*2325054 is 6975162, plus 1 is 6975163, times 3 is 20925489. Okay, Level 8.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 8)) = 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404\n\nWait, let me make sure. 3*20925489 is 62776467, plus 1 is 62776468, times 3 is 188329404.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me see. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I have a 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 3(...) appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each next level adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, how many levels are there?\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of times we have 3(...). Let's see:\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Level 1: 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(Level 1)) \u2192 Level 2: 39\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(Level 2)) \u2192 Level 3: 354\n\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(Level 3)) \u2192 Level 4: 3189\n\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(Level 4)) \u2192 Level 5: 28704\n\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(Level 5)) \u2192 Level 6: 258339\n\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(Level 6)) \u2192 Level 7: 2325054\n\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(Level 7)) \u2192 Level 8: 20925489\n\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(Level 8)) \u2192 Level 9: 188329404\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so after the innermost (1 + 3), each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the innermost, there are 8 such levels beyond the initial 3*(...). Wait, maybe I'm overcounting.\n\nWait, let me try to structure it differently. Let me count the number of 3(...) terms.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step out is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, how many times do we apply this 3*(1 + 3*(...)) operation?\n\nLet me count the number of times 3*(...) appears. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 4)) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 5)) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*86113 = 258339\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 6)) = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*775018 = 2325054\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 7)) = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*6975163 = 20925489\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 3*(Level 8)) = 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*62776468 = 188329404\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, that would mean nine levels, right? So, perhaps I'm correct with Level 9 being 188,329,404.\n\nBut let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers.\n\nStarting with Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. Correct.\n\nOkay, so after computing each level step by step, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each level manually, which could help verify my answer.\n\nLooking at the expression, each level is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote each level as a_n, where n is the level number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 3*a_2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_{n} = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1})\n\nWe can try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1})\n\nLet me expand this:\n\na_n = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's write it as:\n\na_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 9 = 0 \u21d2 r = 9. So, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*9^n\n\nNow, let's find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 9*K = 3 \u21d2 -8*K = 3 \u21d2 K = -3/8\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*9^n - 3/8\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*9^1 - 3/8 \u21d2 4 = 9C - 3/8\n\nAdding 3/8 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/8 = 9C \u21d2 35/8 = 9C \u21d2 C = (35/8)/9 = 35/(72)\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nWe can write 9^n as 9^{n} = 9*9^{n-1}, but maybe it's better to just compute it as is.\n\nNow, since we have 9 levels, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8\n\nLet me compute 9^9 first.\n\n9^1 = 9\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n9^4 = 6561\n\n9^5 = 59049\n\n9^6 = 531441\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\n9^8 = 43046721\n\n9^9 = 387420489\n\nSo, 9^9 = 387,420,489\n\nNow, plug into the formula:\n\na_9 = (35/72)*387,420,489 - 3/8\n\nFirst, compute (35/72)*387,420,489.\n\nLet me compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 first.\n\n387,420,489 \u00f7 72:\n\nWell, 72 \u00d7 5,381,118 = 387,420,489? Wait, let me compute 72 \u00d7 5,381,118.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72:\n\n387,420,489 \u00f7 72:\n\n72 \u00d7 5,000,000 = 360,000,000\n\nSubtract: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489\n\nNow, 72 \u00d7 381,118 = ?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use a calculator approach.\n\nBut perhaps I can factor 72 as 8\u00d79.\n\nSo, 387,420,489 \u00f7 9 = 43,046,721 (since 9 \u00d7 43,046,721 = 387,420,489)\n\nThen, 43,046,721 \u00f7 8 = 5,380,840.125\n\nSo, 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 = 5,380,840.125\n\nNow, multiply by 35:\n\n5,380,840.125 \u00d7 35\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n5,380,840.125 \u00d7 35\n\n= 5,380,840.125 \u00d7 (30 + 5)\n\n= 5,380,840.125 \u00d7 30 + 5,380,840.125 \u00d7 5\n\n= 161,425,203.75 + 26,904,200.625\n\n= 161,425,203.75 + 26,904,200.625 = 188,329,404.375\n\nNow, subtract 3/8:\n\n3/8 = 0.375\n\nSo, 188,329,404.375 - 0.375 = 188,329,404\n\nSo, a_9 = 188,329,404\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each level step by step. That's a good confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple levels of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each level from the innermost outwards and using a recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 188,329,404.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times another nested expression). There are nine levels of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Parentheses**: Start with the innermost expression:\n   - Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n3. **Work Outwards Using Recurrence**:\n   - Each level is computed as 3*(1 + 3*previous_level)\n   - Level 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39\n   - Level 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 354\n   - Level 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3189\n   - Level 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 28704\n   - Level 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 258339\n   - Level 7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 2325054\n   - Level 8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 20925489\n   - Level 9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 188329404\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation**:\n   - The recurrence relation a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}) was solved to find a closed-form expression, confirming the result for Level 9 as 188,329,404.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \n\\boxed{188329404}"

The expression is:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses! Okay, let me try to break this down. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually makes things clearer, especially with nested expressions like this.\n\nSo, let's see. The innermost part is the very last part: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nAlright, so that innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another expression that includes this result. Let me write down each step as I go along.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one step out, we have another expression where this 4 is inside another set of parentheses multiplied by 3. So the next part is:\n\n2. Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 1). Wait, no, actually, looking again, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So perhaps I should work from the inside out, replacing each innermost expression with its value and then computing the next layer.\n\nLet me try to outline each layer step by step. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time we have a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me see: starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, each with a 3 outside. So maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, and then finally multiply by 3.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, each layer is within another 3*(1 + ...), so perhaps each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). Hmm, maybe I should index them starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2 is the next one out, etc.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*29,000 = 87,000.\n\nThen, 3*524 = 1,572.\n\nAdding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down.\n\n9000*3=27,000.\n\n800*3=2,400.\n\n40*3=120.\n\n1*3=3.\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. As I computed earlier, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because sometimes even small mistakes can happen.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That's another way to check.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just quickly recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make any miscalculations.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each layer one at a time without getting lost.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make sure I understand the structure. It's a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that include 1 plus another 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last set of parentheses, I can work my way out.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1+3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, 1+3*(result of above)\n3. Then, 1+3*(result of above)\n4. And this repeats until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. Starting from the left:\n\n- The first parenthesis is at the end: (1+3)\n- Then, moving left, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the left, I see 3 followed by a parenthesis. Each time, there's a 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let me count how many times this happens. I think it's 9 layers, but let me check.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"(\" is an opening parenthesis, and each \")\" is a closing one. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n- The first term is 3, then an opening parenthesis: count 1\n- Then inside, another opening parenthesis: count 2\n- Then another: count 3\n- Then another: count 4\n- Then another: count 5\n- Then another: count 6\n- Then another: count 7\n- Then another: count 8\n- Then another: count 9\n- Then a closing parenthesis: count 10\n- Then another closing: 11\n- And so on until the end.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because each \"1+3(\" adds a new opening parenthesis. Let me try again.\n\nActually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. It looks like there are 9 layers of 1+3, each multiplied by 3 in the outer layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n...\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9), but L9 is 1 + 3*L8, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*L8). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outwards. Let me try that.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost parentheses and work my way out.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step out. Let me list each step clearly.\n\nLet me define each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, no carryover.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 total so far 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 total 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 total 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 total 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation.\n\nLet me recount each S step:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but let me check S9 again. Is S9 the innermost? Wait no, S1 is the innermost, and S9 is the next layer out. Wait, no, actually, in the expression, each layer is a 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's S1, then each layer out adds another 1 + 3*(previous).\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(layer1) \u2192 layer2\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(layer2) \u2192 layer3\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so the number of layers inside is 9, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and I can see that there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", each \"1+3(\" adds another \"(\", so let's count:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, that's 9 opening parentheses, meaning there are 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(previous). Then, the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, when I computed up to S9 = 29524, that's the result of the innermost 9 layers, and then the entire expression is 3*S9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers, each S1 to S9, and then multiplied by 3. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is S_n - 3*S_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is S_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution S_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition S1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1, S1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\nSo, 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt n=1: S1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nAt n=2: S2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nAt n=3: S3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which also matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, S9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, S9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the result is used in the next outer layer. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find a closed-form solution to efficiently compute the result, leading to the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n2. Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6.

I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the arithmetic checks out.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result).

Okay, so I need to compute this step by step. Since it's nested, I should probably start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards.

But let me confirm that each step is correct.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step, because that would throw off all subsequent layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems to check out. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this, maybe a geometric series or something, but given that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a recursive sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssume a_p = C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nSubtract 3C from both sides:\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the innermost being n=1 up to n=9, so the value at layer 9 is:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nLet me write this down as I go. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). Since the innermost is 4, the next one would be (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\nSecond level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each level is 1 plus 3 times the result of the next level. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(result of inner expression). So, starting from the inside:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Level 9, which is the innermost, we go outwards each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But actually, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous result.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels. Let me count how many times 3 is being multiplied. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is level 1, and each subsequent level adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), then each step out adds another 3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after each 1:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nWait, so that's 9 levels. So after the innermost, we have 8 more levels, making it 9 in total. Then, the outermost is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost expression up to 29524, that's the value inside the parentheses, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3.\n\n29000*3 = 87000\n\n524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72 \u2192 1500 +72=1572.\n\nSo, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the levels. Let me recount the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*(...). The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent level adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of 3s inside the parentheses.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 level 1\n2. 3*(level 1) added to 1 \u2192 level 2\n3. 3*(level 2) added to 1 \u2192 level 3\n4. 3*(level 3) added to 1 \u2192 level 4\n5. 3*(level 4) added to 1 \u2192 level 5\n6. 3*(level 5) added to 1 \u2192 level 6\n7. 3*(level 6) added to 1 \u2192 level 7\n8. 3*(level 7) added to 1 \u2192 level 8\n9. 3*(level 8) added to 1 \u2192 level 9\n\nSo, level 9 is the innermost expression, and then the outermost is 3*(level 9). So, yes, 9 levels inside, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to level 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which would be a_1 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen the outermost is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, but given that it's only 9 levels, computing step by step is manageable.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, for a_9, n=9.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as 3*a_9, where a_9 is as above.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify once more by computing each level step by step.\n\nCompute each level:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLevel 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLevel4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLevel5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLevel6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLevel7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLevel8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLevel9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute a few of these levels:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLevel2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLevel3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLevel4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLevel5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLevel6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level).

It seems like each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That sounds like a plan.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost part is the last one. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nNow, the next layer is (1 + 3(4)). Let's compute that. First, 3 times 4 is 12, then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that part becomes 13.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression is now:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))\n\nNext, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(13)). Let me compute 3 times 13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, that part is 40.\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3(40)). Let's compute 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nReplacing that, we have:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))))\n\nMoving outward, compute (1 + 3(121)). 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo, expression now is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))\n\nNext, compute (1 + 3(364)). 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo, replacing, we get:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))))\n\nMoving on, compute (1 + 3(1093)). 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nSo, now the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)))\n\nNext, compute (1 + 3(3280)). 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo, expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(9841))\n\nCompute (1 + 3(9841)). 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n3(29524)\n\nFinally, compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, yes. Let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps because that's a lot of layers.\n\nLet me recap the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, each time, it's like a geometric series or something. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression.\n\nLet me think. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). So, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. Let me denote the innermost value as a starting point and see how it builds up.\n\nIf I let x\u2080 = 1 + 3, then x\u2081 = 1 + 3x\u2080, x\u2082 = 1 + 3x\u2081, and so on, up to x\u2088, since there are 9 layers of 1+3(...).\n\nWait, let's count the number of layers. Each time, we have a 3(1 + ...) so starting from the innermost, each step is a new layer. From the original problem, it's 3(...) with 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, it's 9 layers, meaning we have x\u2080 to x\u2088.\n\nWait, let me check: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 9 instances of 1+3. So, starting from the innermost, we have x\u2080 = 1 + 3, then x\u2081 = 1 + 3x\u2080, up to x\u2088, which is the outermost.\n\nSo, in general, x\u2099 = 1 + 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081, with x\u2080 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is x\u2099 = 1 + 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081, with x\u2080 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is x\u2099 - 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3\u207f.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is x\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition x\u2080 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3\u2070 - 1/2 => 4 = C - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, the solution is x\u2099 = (9/2)*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\nx\u2099 = (9*3\u207f - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 8 (since we have 9 layers, from x\u2080 to x\u2088), x\u2088 = (9*3\u2078 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3\u2078:\n\n3\u00b9 = 3\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n3\u00b3 = 27\n\n3\u2074 = 81\n\n3\u2075 = 243\n\n3\u2076 = 729\n\n3\u2077 = 2187\n\n3\u2078 = 6561\n\nSo, 9*3\u2078 = 9*6561 = 59049.\n\nThus, x\u2088 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify using a different method to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6.

Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n10. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[ 3(29524) = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of layers! It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times something. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3):\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3( ... )). Since I just computed the innermost part, let's substitute that in.\n\n2. Compute (1 + 3*(previous result)):\n   - Here, previous result is 4.\n   - So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I have a 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(result from inside). Let me write this out step by step to keep track.\n\nLet me number each layer from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9, since there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...)) is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. From the innermost, which is (1+3), then each step adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to Layer 8, since the outermost is 3*(...). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just start from the innermost and work my way out.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, is that right? Wait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers I've done here. Each step is a new layer, starting from the innermost as step 1. So step 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nThen step 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...). So after computing the innermost 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3 times that result.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. Each time you have a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer 8 result) = 3*9841 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 3*9841\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400 \u2192 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n40 * 3 = 120 \u2192 29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n1 * 3 = 3 \u2192 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, the outermost result is 29523.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had Layer 9 as 29524, but that was after 9 layers, but perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The original expression is 3*(Layer 8 result), so after 8 layers of (1+3(...)), we have Layer 8 as 9841, then multiply by 3 to get 29523.\n\nWait, but when I did the steps earlier, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, but that was including the outermost 3*(...), which would be Layer 9. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me go through it again, carefully.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400 \u2192 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120 \u2192 29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n1 * 3 = 3 \u2192 29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo, the result is 29,523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 29,524 as Layer 9, but that was including the 3*(Layer 8) as Layer 9. So, that would mean the total is 29,523.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nSo, that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen each (1+3(...) is another layer, so total layers before the outermost 3*(...) would be 8 layers. So, after 8 layers, we have 9841, then multiply by 3 to get 29,523.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern in the results of each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nCheck:\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a formula for a_n, then compute a_8 and multiply by 3.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nAssume solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and particular solution is B = -1/2.\n\nThus, general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=8, a_8 = (3^{9} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_8 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 =9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, a_8 =9841.\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*a_8 =3*9841=29523.\n\nSo, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm by computing 3*9841 again.\n\nCompute 9841 *3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdd them up:27000+2400=29400; 29400+120=29520; 29520+3=29523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the computed value is 29,523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to break it down starting from the innermost part.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Then: 1 + 3*(result of above)\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result of above)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times the pattern \"1+3(...)\" appears. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. ... and this continues until the 9th layer, since the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the original expression, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 multiplied by another expression. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...).\n\nLet me try to write it step by step, starting from the innermost and working outward.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, S2 would be 1 + 3*S1\n\nSo S2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, S3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, we're taking the result from the innermost and plugging it into the next outer layer.\n\nSo S1 is 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 is 1 + 3*(S1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nS3 is 1 + 3*(S2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nS4 is 1 + 3*(S3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the outermost expression is 3*(S9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing S9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses inside each other, so S1 to S9. Then the entire expression is 3*(S9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, S9 is 29524, so 3*29524 would be 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me go step by step again, perhaps I messed up in the multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting over:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = Let's compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(S9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify once more because the numbers get large quickly, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each step manually. Let's see.\n\nEach step is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, starting with S1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe general form is S_n = a + b*S_{n-1}, with S1 = c.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 3, and S1 = 4.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is S_n = (c - a/(1 - b)) * b^{n-1} + a/(1 - b), but since b > 1, this might not be the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as S_n = 3^n * S0 + something, but let me see.\n\nWait, actually, since each S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, and starting from S1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. Wait, but S1 is 1 + 3, so S1 = 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S0 being undefined, but maybe starting from S1.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern.\n\nS1 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, as before.\n\nSo the final step is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express each S_n as (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let's test that.\n\nWait, S1 = 4. If n=1, (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. That works.\n\nS2 = 13. (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. That works.\n\nS3 = 40. (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nS4 =121. (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the general formula seems to be S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because for S1, n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=4, which is correct.\n\nSo, S9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo S9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*S9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the value of each nested expression and substituting it into the next outer layer. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a formula, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Okay, so it's a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that involve 1 plus 3 times something else. Let me see if I can break it down from the inside out.\n\nFirst, I notice that this is a repeated pattern: each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by another similar expression). So, maybe I can work from the innermost part and move outward.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. I'll label each step to keep track.\n\nStarting with the innermost part:\n\nStep 1: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the next layer. Let's move one step out.\n\nStep 2: Now, the next layer is 3 times (1 + the result from Step 1). So, that would be 3*(1 + 4). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute the inside: 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3*5 = 15.\n\nAlright, so that simplifies the next layer. Let's go one step further out.\n\nStep 3: The next layer is 3*(1 + the result from Step 2). So, 3*(1 + 15). Compute that.\n\nInside first: 1 + 15 = 16.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*16 = 48.\n\nMoving on to the next layer.\n\nStep 4: Now, it's 3*(1 + the result from Step 3). So, 3*(1 + 48).\n\nCompute inside: 1 + 48 = 49.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*49 = 147.\n\nContinuing outward.\n\nStep 5: Next layer is 3*(1 + the result from Step 4). So, 3*(1 + 147).\n\nCompute inside: 1 + 147 = 148.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*148 = 444.\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let's keep going.\n\nStep 6: Now, 3*(1 + 444). So, inside is 1 + 444 = 445.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*445 = 1335.\n\nWait, that's a jump. Let me make sure I did that right. 445 times 3 is indeed 1335. Okay, moving on.\n\nStep 7: Next, 3*(1 + 1335). Inside is 1 + 1335 = 1336.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*1336. Let me compute that. 1336 * 3: 1336*3 is 4008? Wait, let me check: 1300*3=3900, 36*3=108, so total is 3900 + 108 = 4008. Yes, correct.\n\nStep 8: Now, moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 + 4008). Inside is 1 + 4008 = 4009.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*4009. Let's compute that. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so total is 12000 + 27 = 12027.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check: 4009*3. Yes, 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so 12027. Correct.\n\nStep 9: Next layer is 3*(1 + 12027). Inside is 1 + 12027 = 12028.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*12028. Let me compute that. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so total is 36000 + 84 = 36084.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a big jump. Let me verify: 12028*3. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so yes, 36084. Correct.\n\nStep 10: Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084). Inside is 1 + 36084 = 36085.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*36085. Let me compute that. 36000*3=108000, 85*3=255, so total is 108000 + 255 = 108255.\n\nWait, that's a huge number. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, so each step, the number is tripling and adding 3 each time? Or is it more complicated?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach time, we're doing 3*(1 + previous result). So, if I let a_n be the result at step n, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recursion is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's write it as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 3\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. Wait, but what is the initial condition?\n\nLooking back at the problem, the innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but according to the recursion, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), so n=1 would correspond to the innermost expression.\n\nBut in our case, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of 3s multiplied by expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of 3s:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(... So, each \"3(\" adds a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)\n\n2. 3(1+3(...)\n\n3. 3(1+3(...)\n\n4. 3(1+3(...)\n\n5. 3(1+3(...)\n\n6. 3(1+3(...)\n\n7. 3(1+3(...)\n\n8. 3(1+3(...)\n\n9. 3(1+3(...)\n\n10. 3(...)\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), which is not preceded by a 3. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, since there are 9 \"3(\" after the first one.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. 3(\n\n2. 3(\n\n3. 3(\n\n4. 3(\n\n5. 3(\n\n6. 3(\n\n7. 3(\n\n8. 3(\n\n9. 3(\n\nAnd then the innermost is (1+3). So, there are 9 layers. So, n=9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 10 steps, starting from the innermost as step 1 up to step 10. So, maybe n=9 corresponds to step 10.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recursion starts at n=0.\n\nBut maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, since I already computed step-by-step up to 10 steps and got 108255, perhaps that's correct.\n\nBut let me check my initial step-by-step computation again, because 108255 seems really large, but considering each step is tripling, it might be correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute it in another way.\n\nLet me represent the expression as:\n\nE = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12? Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had E_1 as 4, but that was the innermost (1 + 3). Maybe I confused the notation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to redefine E_n. Let me think.\n\nIf I define E_n as the expression with n layers, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nE_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nE_6 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nE_7 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nE_8 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nE_9 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nE_10 = 3*(1 + E_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nWait, so E_1 is the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen each subsequent E_n adds another layer, so E_10 is the outermost expression.\n\nSo, the total number of layers is 10, hence E_10 = 108255.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 108255.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify each step again quickly.\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_10 = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, the computed value is indeed 108255.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each step is a geometric series or something, but given the time, step-by-step computation seems manageable here.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer from the inside out, the final result is 108255.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer involves multiplying 3 by the sum of 1 and the result of the previous layer. By computing each layer sequentially, the final result is found to be 108255.\n\n$\\boxed{108255}$"

So let me see:\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the entire expression. So after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, we still have to multiply that result by 3.\n\nSo the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nCompute that: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large. Let me go through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each multiplication:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*4=12, 1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 3*13=39, 1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 3*40=120, 1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, each step checks out. So the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by simplifying each nested layer from the inside out.

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses and threes. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of threes and parentheses. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because each opening parenthesis has to be matched with a closing one, so starting inside will help me avoid confusion.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count: starting from the innermost, I think there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Hmm, actually, let me check.\n\nWait, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), and each time, the innermost one is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3 times (1 + ...). So, let's see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then moving outwards, each step adds another 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are 9 layers. Therefore, starting from the innermost, I need to compute 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(result of the next layer). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4), which is 1 + 12 = 13, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on until I get to the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try to outline this:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outward. So, starting from the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nWell, 3*29524: let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 \u00d73=88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of times 1 +3(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 +3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, the first ( is at position 2.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( is nested inside. Let me count how many times I see (1 +3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 +3), then each layer adds another (1 +3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of ( after the first 3.\n\nEach layer adds one more (1 +3(...)).\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 +3) is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another (1 +3*(...)).\n\nSo, in the expression, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n(1 +3) \u2192 layer 1\n\nThen, (1 +3*(layer1)) \u2192 layer2\n\nThen, (1 +3*(layer2)) \u2192 layer3\n\nAnd so on until layer9.\n\nYes, so 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to compute it another way, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form 1 +3*previous layer. So, it's a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at layer n.\n\nThen, a_1 = 1 +3 =4.\n\na_2 =1 +3*a1 =1 +12=13.\n\na_3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40.\n\na_4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121.\n\na_5=1 +3*a4=1 +363=364.\n\na_6=1 +3*a5=1 +1092=1093.\n\na_7=1 +3*a6=1 +3279=3280.\n\na_8=1 +3*a7=1 +9840=9841.\n\na_9=1 +3*a8=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me see. The recursive relation is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants.\n\nWe can find D by solving the steady-state equation: D =1 +3*D \u21d2 D -3D =1 \u21d2 -2D=1 \u21d2 D= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula for n=1:\n\na_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n20000 \u00d73=60000\n\n9000 \u00d73=27000\n\n500 \u00d73=1500\n\n20 \u00d73=60\n\n4 \u00d73=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)).

Okay, so it's a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that contain 1 plus another 3 times something. It seems like a recursive expression where each layer is similar but with one fewer set of parentheses.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting confused by the nesting.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer.

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Okay, so it's a series of 1s and 3s nested inside each other. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built from the innermost parentheses outward. So, to solve this, I should start from the inside and work my way out. That makes sense because each inner expression is used in the outer one.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s inside. Hmm, maybe it's easier to count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\nWait, let's parse the structure. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a sum. That sum is 1 plus 3 times another sum, which is 1 plus 3 times another sum, and so on.\n\nSo, it's a recursive structure, where each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me define it more clearly. Let's say each inner expression is E_n, where n is the number of layers from the innermost.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2\n\nAnd so on, until E_9, because I think there are 9 layers. Let me check that.\n\nWait, in the original problem, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: starting after the first 3, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...))\n- Continuing until the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer.

(1 + 3\nWait, but the last one is just 1 + 3, without another parenthesis. So, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, let's see:\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, because starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer, and the outermost is Layer 9.\n\nWait, let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...).

Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach time I open a parenthesis, I have a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each layer adds another \"1 + 3(\" until the innermost, which is \"1 + 3\".\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- After the first 3, we have (1 + 3(\n- Then another (1 + 3(\n- Then another (1 + 3(\n- And so on.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2.

So, the innermost expression is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, no, because the first 3 is followed by the first layer: 1 + 3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think recursively. Let me define each layer as E_n, where n is the number of layers from the innermost.\n\nSo, E_1 = 1 + 3\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2\n\n...\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*E_9\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(E_9), right?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, yes, the outermost is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is E_9.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute E_1 through E_9, then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let's compute each E_n step by step.\n\nStarting with E_1:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E_n.\n\nLet me recalculate E_1 through E_9:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Because starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer, and the outermost is the 9th.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time we have a new layer.\n\nSo, the first layer after the initial 3 is (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), etc., until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers is that?\n\nFrom the expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, because each \"1 + 3(\" adds one, and the last one is just 1 + 3 without another parenthesis.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the expression is:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses is 8. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression is the 8th layer, and the outermost is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the layers as the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have another 1 + 3(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is the second layer.\n\nThen, the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which is the third layer.\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in the expression, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each time we add another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3(...), which is 9 times.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sequences.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3\n\nWait, so the last one is just 1 + 3, without another parenthesis. So, the number of layers is 9, with the innermost being the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had E_1 to E_9, starting from the innermost as E_1, which would mean that the outermost is E_9.\n\nBut in the expression, the outermost is 3*(E_9), which is correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed E_9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm the number of layers. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see that each time we have a new layer, we add another \"1 + 3(\", so the number of layers is the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears, which is 8, because the innermost is just \"1 + 3\".\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nSo, that's 8 layers of computation after the innermost, which was 1 + 3.\n\nWait, so that would mean that the innermost is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another computation, so layer 8 would be the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(E_8), because E_1 is 1 + 3, E_2 is 1 + 3*E_1, up to E_8, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought E_9 was the outermost, but now I'm thinking it's E_8.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nIf I have the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), and the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time I go out, I add another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, the number of layers is the number of times I can go out, which is 8 times, because the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each outer layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, each time we go out, we have another 1 + 3(...).

Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nEach time we have a new layer, it's a new \"1 + 3(\", so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1.

(1 + 3\n\nWait, that's 9 \"1 + 3(\" instances, but the last one doesn't have another ( after it, it's just 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost as layer 1.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation was correct, with E_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because when I count the opening parentheses, I see 8 after the initial 3, which would mean 8 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me write the expression as a tree.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is a node in the tree, with the outermost being 3 multiplied by a sum, which is 1 + 3 times the next layer.\n\nSo, the innermost node is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen, each parent node is 1 + 3 times the child node.\n\nSo, the number of layers is the number of nodes, which is 9.\n\nTherefore, the computation should be as I did earlier, with E_9 = 29524, and the entire expression being 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by manually computing a smaller version.\n\nSuppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nThat would be 3 layers:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, computing directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, if we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), that's 2 layers:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nEntire expression: 3*13 = 39\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the number of layers is 9, so E_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the nested expression step by step:\n\n1.

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, okay, so I need to compute this expression step by step. Let me try to break it down. I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, it's best to start from the innermost parentheses and work your way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next parentheses would be 1 + 3*(result from above). Let me compute that.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I have a structure like 1 + 3*(something). So, each step involves computing the innermost part, then substituting it into the next level, and so on.\n\nLet me list each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next level: (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*(40)) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*(121)) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*(364)) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*(1093)) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*(3280)) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*(9841)) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on, let me count the number of parentheses to make sure I didn't miss a level. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the first 3(1+... So, starting from the innermost, I should have 9 levels. Let me recount:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Then the outermost 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so that's 9 levels inside, starting from the innermost, so 9 computations, and then the outermost 3 times that result. So, 10 steps in total.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had 9 computations, and then the 10th step is the outermost multiplication. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, step 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nStep 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nStep 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nStep 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nStep 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nStep 10: 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and how many times does this happen?\n\nStarting from the innermost, each level is 1 + 3*(...). So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3(1 + 3(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as having 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), each nested inside the previous one, and then the outermost 3 times that.\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on, 9 times, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a better way to think about it. So, let me try to model this as a recursive computation, where each step is 1 + 3*previous_result, starting from 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how many times we apply the operation 1 + 3*(...).\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, let's list each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(previous), and then the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, now, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524.\n\nBut actually, 29524 is 29000 + 524.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 3 * 29524 directly.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet's add 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write down 0, carryover 1\n\n9 + 9 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write down 9, carryover 1\n\n2 + 2 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 + 1 = 7\n\n0 + 5 = 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the sum is 88572.\n\nYes, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, this expression seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, and then compute a_9, since there are 9 layers inside, and then multiply by 3.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, we need a_9, since there are 9 layers inside.\n\nCompute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result we got earlier.

    "text": " It's this long expression with a bunch of nested parentheses and multiplication by 3 each time. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of layers. I think I need to solve this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nOkay, so let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses seem to be (1 + 3). Let me check: the very last part is (1 + 3)), so that's the innermost one. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1 + 3) is 4. Got that. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, actually, I need to go step by step. Let me count the number of layers. Each time, it's 3 times (1 + something). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then moving out, it's 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of step 2)\n4. And this continues until we get back to the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, actually, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...) starting from the innermost (1 + 3). Let me make sure: Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...), and the ... itself is another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each opening parenthesis has a 3 multiplied by it, except the very first one. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside the entire expression.\n2. Then, each subsequent 3 is inside, so let's count them:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 8 more 3s inside the parentheses. Wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, the structure is 3(...), where inside is 1 + 3(...). So each layer adds another 3. Let me count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier:\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3*(...)\n2. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...)\n3. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...)\n4. ... and so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times 3 is multiplied. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s before each parenthesis:\n\n- The first 3 is outside the entire expression.\n- Then, inside, each time we have a 3 before the next parenthesis.\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after each opening parenthesis:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside: that's 1\n2. Then, inside, each layer has a 3. Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So each time, we have a 3 multiplied by the next parentheses. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Then: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Then: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Then: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost 3: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Each time, after computing the innermost, I move out one layer. Let me write each step clearly:\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\nS1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nS2: Compute (1 + 3*S1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: Compute (1 + 3*S2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: Compute (1 + 3*S3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: Compute (1 + 3*S4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: Compute (1 + 3*S5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: Compute (1 + 3*S6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: Compute (1 + 3*S7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: Compute (1 + 3*S8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3 multiplies this result: 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but let me check: The original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is S9. So the total expression is 3*S9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So S1 is the innermost (1 + 3), then S2 is (1 + 3*S1), up to S9, which is (1 + 3*S8). Then, the entire expression is 3*S9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier counting, I had S1 to S9 as the innermost to the one before the outermost 3. So actually, the total expression is 3*(S9), which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: Each time, I'm moving out one layer, so after S9, which is (1 + 3*S8) = 29524, then the outermost is 3*(29524).\n\nSo, 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3: Let me compute step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. Let me go through each S1 to S9 again.\n\nS1: 1+3=4\n\nS2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nS3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nS4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nS5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nS6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nS7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nS8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nS9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute this without doing each step manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLet me think: The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n=9, because from the innermost (1+3) up to the outermost 3*(...), there are 9 layers.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value after n layers.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWe can model this as a recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nIn our case, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation of S9 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with our step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just quickly recap:\n\n- The expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...)\n- Using the recurrence relation, we found a closed-form formula\n- Computed a_9 = 29524\n- Then multiplied by 3 to get 88572\n\nYes, that all adds up. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication by 3 and addition. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this, we determine the value of each layer and eventually compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the innermost expression:**\n   - Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. **Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the previous layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - 3*29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

It looks like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That makes sense because parentheses indicate that the operations inside should be done first.\n\nOkay, let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses are (1 + 3). Let me note that down:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost layer. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me clarify:\n\nThe structure is like this:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + ... )))\n\nSo each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next expression). So starting from the innermost, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer from the inside out. There are nine layers, I think. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the ninth layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the base case, then each layer builds on that.\n\nSo, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out, labeling each step as S1, S2, etc.\n\nSo, starting with S1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each step is 1 + 3 times the previous step.\n\nWait, but actually, each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). So yes, S1 = 4, S2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, S3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nSo let's compute each step step by step.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(...). So after computing S9, which is the innermost expression, we have to multiply by 3 each time we go up a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers. Let me think again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the ninth layer. Then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each layer being 3*(1 + next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, and so on.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but that seems different from my earlier approach. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I was computing S1 = 4, S2 = 13, etc., but that didn't account for the multiplication by 3 each time. So perhaps my second approach is correct.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then moving out:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo the total expression is Layer9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). So each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So yes, the ninth layer would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify that by computing each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here.\n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me denote the nth layer as a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nLet me write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 3 => -2*K = 3 => K = -3/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-3/2) = 3*C - 3/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3*C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nThus, C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 3/2:\n\na_n = (3/2)*(11/3)*3^{n-1} - 3/2\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it directly for n=9.\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSo for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280*11 = 36,080 and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is correct. I used two methods: step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, both leading to the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each being 3 times (1 plus the next layer). Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying 3 with (1 plus the result of the previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 36,084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can handle each part one at a time without getting confused.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost expression is:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward.

Let me check:\n\nAfter a_8 = 9841, then a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 3*9841 = 29523, then thought that was the final result, but no, because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which after 9 levels, the innermost is 4, and each level adds a 3*(...) +1, so after 9 levels, a_9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I first computed without the recurrence, I ended up with 29523, but that was because I stopped at a_9 = 29523, but actually, a_9 is 29524, and then we multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial computation by not going all the way to a_9 and then multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, let me try to compute it again step by step, without using the recurrence, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but when I first computed, I thought I had 29523, but that was before the last multiplication by 3. So, yes, 88572 is the correct result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nWait, each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9 (since we have 9 levels), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using exponents without computing each step.\n\nSince each level is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying using the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem that can be solved by expanding each level from the innermost parentheses outward. By breaking down each step and using a recurrence relation, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me count how many times the 3 is multiplied by a bracketed term.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to work from the inside out, calculating each step and keeping track.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8), which is:\n\n3*9841 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*9841:\n\nFirst, 3*9000 = 27000\n\nThen, 3*800 = 2400\n\nNext, 3*40 = 120\n\nFinally, 3*1 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me check that multiplication again because 9841*3 might be a bit off.\n\nWait, 9841*3:\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12, carry over 1\n\n8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29.\n\nSo writing it down: 29523.\n\nWait, but let me verify:\n\n9841\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n3*1 = 3\n\n3*4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n\n3*9 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, write down the 2. Wait, that can't be right because 9841 is a 4-digit number, so 3*9841 should be 29523, which is a 5-digit number starting with 2.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method:\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 8 as 9841, that seems high. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me go step by step through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364:\n\n3*300 = 900\n\n3*60 = 180\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nAdding up: 900 + 180 = 1080; 1080 + 12 = 1092\n\nSo Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093:\n\n3*1000 = 3000\n\n3*90 = 270\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding up: 3000 + 270 = 3270; 3270 + 9 = 3279\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280:\n\n3*3000 = 9000\n\n3*200 = 600\n\n3*80 = 240\n\nAdding up: 9000 + 600 = 9600; 9600 + 240 = 9840\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me count how many layers:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer 3) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer 4) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer 5) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer 6) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer 7) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. The outermost 3*(Layer 8) \u2192 So total layers processed are 8, but the outermost is the 9th multiplication.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me see: each opening parenthesis after the initial 3 is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize it as:\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, the innermost is Layer 1, and each time I go out, it's another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then:\n\n1. (1 + 3( ... )) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3( ... )) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because after the initial 3, there are 8 sets of (1 + 3(...)). Let me check:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next part is (1 + 3(...)), which is the first inner layer.\n\nSo, the number of inner layers is 8, as each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 8, I had 8 layers, and then multiplied by the outermost 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers because the original expression has 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Wait, maybe I need to recount.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because each time you have a new (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is one more than three times the previous layer.\n\nSo, let me list the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, that's different from before. So if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression would be 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought the outermost layer was Layer 8, and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. But now, I'm seeing that perhaps there's a Layer 9, which would change the result.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me try to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- Starting with 3*(...), then inside that, (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 2.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each opening parenthesis starts a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. And so on, until the last (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 8, because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and the last one ends with (1 + 3), which is Layer 8.\n\nWait, so perhaps there are 8 layers, meaning that Layer 8 is 9841, and then the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut in my earlier count, I thought of 9 layers, but perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize the structure.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but in this case, the outermost 3 is multiplied by Layer 8, which is 9841, giving 29523.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought of 9 layers, I mistakenly included the outermost 3 as a layer, which it's not\u2014it's just a multiplication.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute up to Layer 8, which is 9841, and then multiply by 3 to get 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check again by another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, we can find the solution as follows:\n\nThe general solution is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's check this formula with the values we have:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the value of a_8 is 9841, and the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*9841 again.\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers, let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost, there are 8 layers before reaching the outermost 3. So, Layer 8 is 9841, and then 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nSo, the final answer is 29523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe evaluate each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{29523}\n\\]"

The problem is:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's quite a chain of operations. Let me try to break it down from the inside out, as that's usually how nested expressions work. I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. \n\nFirst, I notice that the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, let me check that. Actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next inner expression). Hmm, maybe I should write each step clearly.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the inside out to keep track. There are nine sets of parentheses, so I'll label them P1 to P9, with P1 being the innermost.\n\nP1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving out to P2: 1 + 3*(P1). Wait, no, actually, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So P2 would be 1 + 3*(P1). Let me compute that.\n\nP2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so P2 is 13. Now, moving out to P3: 1 + 3*(P2). So that's 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So P3 is 40.\n\nNext, P4: 1 + 3*(P3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So P4 is 121.\n\nMoving on to P5: 1 + 3*(P4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. P5 is 364.\n\nNow, P6: 1 + 3*(P5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\nLet me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. P6 is 1093.\n\nProceeding to P7: 1 + 3*(P6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. P7 is 3280.\n\nNext, P8: 1 + 3*(P7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. P8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, P9: 1 + 3*(P8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So P9 is 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems like a big number. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each step again.\n\nStarting from P1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nP2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nP3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nP4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nP5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nP6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nP7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nP8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nP9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 again to be sure. 9841 * 3:\n\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 800 * 3 = 2400\n- 40 * 3 = 120\n- 1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So P9 is indeed 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by P9. So the outermost operation is 3*(P9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify with another method to be absolutely sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo writing it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1\n- Thousands place: 2*3=6 +1=7\n- Ten-thousands place: 9*3=27 \u21927, carryover2\n- Hundred-thousands place:5*3=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover1\n- Millions place: 2*3=6 +1=7\n- Ten-millions place:9*3=27 \u21927, carryover2\n- Hundred-millions place:8*3=24 +2=26 \u21926, carryover2\n- Billions place:2*3=6 +2=8\n\nPutting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check once more because the number is quite large and it's easy to make an error in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 2 = 26 \u2192 write 6, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88,572. That's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps when computing P9, let me go through that again.\n\nP9 was 1 + 3*(P8), where P8 was 9841.\n\nSo 3 * 9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute back and compute the next level:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Let me try to parse this carefully.\n\nI know that when dealing with nested parentheses, I should start from the innermost one and work my way out. So, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another set of parentheses around it. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3(1 + ..., that's another layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3(1 + ...)\n3. 3(1 + ...)\n...\nWait, maybe it's better to write them out step by step.\n\nLet me start by labeling each layer for clarity.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3(Layer 1) + something? Wait, no, each layer is 3 times (1 + next layer). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think recursively.\n\nWait, maybe I should start from the innermost and compute each step, moving outward.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nLet me start from the innermost and work my way out. I'll compute each layer step by step.\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*(4) = 12.\n\nWait, but looking at the problem, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me count the number of layers. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s before each (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), then moving left, each 3 is followed by (1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9? Because each time we go one layer out, we add another 3*(...). Let me check:\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the right, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s outside each parenthesis:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's the first layer.\n\n2. Then, moving left, we have 3*(1 + ...), which is the second layer.\n\n3. Then another 3*(1 + ...), third layer.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, the problem has 3(1 + 3(...)) and each ... is another 3(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nLet me count the number of times the pattern 3(1 + 3(...) appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of 3s before each parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me define each layer from the inside out.\n\nLet me start with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in the problem, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but the problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 9 layers, right? Let me check:\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is 9, because each \"3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 such 3s before the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, I have Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time computing 3*(1 + previous layer). So, according to my calculation above, Layer 9 would be 36084.\n\nBut let me check my steps again because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the final result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check another way to be sure. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can express as a geometric series or something.\n\nWait, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + L_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + L_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nWait, so L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 3 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-A = 3\n\nSo, A = -3.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3\n\n4 = 3C - 3\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\n7 = 3C\n\nSo, C = 7/3.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (7/3)*3^n - 3 = 7*3^{n-1} - 3.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, 3^n * (7/3) = 7*3^{n-1}, because 3^n / 3 = 3^{n-1}.\n\nSo, L_n = 7*3^{n-1} - 3.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = 7*3^{0} - 3 = 7*1 - 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = 7*3^{1} - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18. Wait, but earlier I calculated L_2 as 15. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence.\n\nWait, looking back, L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence is correct.\n\nBut when I plug n=2 into the formula, I get 18, but earlier I calculated L_2 as 15. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the recurrence.\n\nLet me re-examine the recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute L_2 using the formula:\n\nL_n = 7*3^{n-1} - 3.\n\nFor n=2:\n\n7*3^{1} - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18.\n\nBut according to step-by-step computation, L_2 = 15.\n\nHmm, that's inconsistent. So, my general solution is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the recurrence.\n\nLet me try to compute the first few terms using the recurrence to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nL_1 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nL_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nL_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nL_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nL_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nL_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nL_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nSo, the values are 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084.\n\nNow, let's see if these can be expressed in terms of powers of 3.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nNow, let's see:\n\nL_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1.\n\nWait, no, 3 + 1 = 4, yes.\n\nL_2 = 15 = 3^3 - 12? Not sure.\n\nWait, 15 = 3*5, 48 = 3*16, 147 = 3*49, 444 = 3*148, etc.\n\nWait, 5, 16, 49, 148, etc. Hmm, those numbers look familiar. Let me see:\n\n5 = 3^2 - 4? 9 - 4 = 5.\n\n16 = 3^3 - 13? 27 - 11 = 16? Hmm, not obvious.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a pattern where each L_n is 3^{n+1} - something.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nL_1 = 4 = 3^2 - 5.\n\nL_2 = 15 = 3^3 - 12.\n\nL_3 = 48 = 3^4 - 3^3? 81 - 27 = 54, which is not 48.\n\nHmm, not quite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me test that:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 3)/2 = (9 - 3)/2 = 6/2 = 3. But L_1 is 4, so no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe L_n = (3^{n+1} + something)/something.\n\nWait, let me try to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nn | L_n | 3^{n+1}\n1 | 4 | 9\n2 | 15 | 27\n3 | 48 | 81\n4 | 147 | 243\n5 | 444 | 729\n6 | 1335 | 2187\n7 | 4008 | 6561\n8 | 12027 | 19683\n9 | 36084 | 59049\n\nLooking at these, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's test that:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 3)/2 = (9 - 3)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Not 4. So, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe L_n = (3^{n+1} + 1)/something.\n\nWait, let me try n=1:\n\nIf L_1 = 4, and 3^{2} = 9, then 9 - 5 = 4.\n\nn=2: 27 - 12 = 15.\n\nn=3: 81 - 33 = 48.\n\nn=4: 243 - 96 = 147.\n\nHmm, the subtracted numbers are 5, 12, 33, 96. Not obvious.\n\nWait, perhaps L_n = (3^{n} * (3 - 1)) + 1. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe L_n = 3^{n} + something.\n\nWait, 3^1 = 3, L_1=4, so 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n3^2=9, L_2=15, which is 9 + 6.\n\n3^3=27, L_3=48, which is 27 + 21.\n\n3^4=81, L_4=147, which is 81 + 66.\n\nHmm, the added numbers are 1, 6, 21, 66, which seems like 1, 6, 21, 66, which are multiples of 1, 6, 21, 66... Wait, 1, 6, 21, 66. Each is multiplied by 3 and added 3.\n\nWait, 1*3 + 3 = 6.\n\n6*3 + 3 = 21.\n\n21*3 + 3 = 66.\n\n66*3 + 3 = 201, but L_5=444, which is 729 - 285, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the added numbers are 3^{n} - 2.\n\nWait, 3^1 - 2 = 1, which matches the first addition.\n\n3^2 - 2 = 7, but L_2 addition is 6, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me try to expand it:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, but that's the same as E = 3*(1 + E'), where E' is a similar expression but one layer shorter.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think recursively.\n\nWait, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, if I have n layers, then the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with n layers.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is complicating things. Let me stick to the step-by-step computation.\n\nI had earlier computed up to Layer 9 as 36084, and each step seems correct, so maybe that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=1 to n=3 using the formula I derived earlier, even though it didn't match, but perhaps I made a mistake in solving the recurrence.\n\nWait, the recurrence is L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me solve it again.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nA = 3 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 3\n\n-2A = 3\n\nA = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\nAdd 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C\n\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 = (11*3^{n}) / (6).\n\nWe can write this as (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (11*3^1)/6 - 3/2 = (33)/6 - 3/2 = 5.5 - 1.5 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (11*9)/6 - 3/2 = (99)/6 - 1.5 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (11*27)/6 - 3/2 = (297)/6 - 1.5 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4 = (11*81)/6 - 3/2 = (891)/6 - 1.5 = 148.5 - 1.5 = 147. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL_5 = (11*243)/6 - 3/2 = (2673)/6 - 1.5 = 445.5 - 1.5 = 444. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nL_6 = (11*729)/6 - 3/2 = (8019)/6 - 1.5 = 1336.5 - 1.5 = 1335. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nL_7 = (11*2187)/6 - 3/2 = (24057)/6 - 1.5 = 4009.5 - 1.5 = 4008. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nL_8 = (11*6561)/6 - 3/2 = (72171)/6 - 1.5 = 12028.5 - 1.5 = 12027. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nL_9 = (11*19683)/6 - 3/2 = (216513)/6 - 1.5 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, the value of the expression with 9 layers is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s before each parenthesis:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3).\n\n- Then, moving left, we have 3*(1 + ...).\n\nEach \"3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count how many times I see \"3(\" before the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3, then inside the first parenthesis, it's 1 + 3(...), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3s before each opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because each \"3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 such \"3(\" before the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"3(\" in the expression:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the innermost is just (1 + 3), without a preceding 3. Wait, perhaps I should count the number of times \"3(\" appears before the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the outside, the first term is 3*(1 + ...). Then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of 3*(1 + ... is 9 times. Therefore, the number of layers is 9, so n=9, so L_9 = 36084.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with 9 layers. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by multiplying 3 with (1 + the result of the next layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 36084.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Final Layer):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

It looks like each part is similar, so maybe there's a pattern I can use instead of computing each one individually. But I'm not sure yet, so I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That seems like a safe approach because each set of parentheses depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(result of above)\n3. Then another layer, and so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that each opening parenthesis after the first 3(1 + ... has another 3(1 + ... inside it. Let me try to count them.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, that's 9 layers? Hmm, let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have \"1 + 3\", and then each next layer wraps another 3(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4.\n- Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(4)\n- Then another layer out: 1 + 3*(result from previous step)\n- And this continues until we get to the outermost layer.\n\nWait, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1 + ...). Each time, it's another 3(1 + ...), so each layer adds another multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number them from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, since each time we add another 3(1 + ...). Let me try that.\n\nLet me start by computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times that Layer 9 result, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but that's 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify my layers again because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1 + ...:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen each next layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many times 3(1 + ...) appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after each 3(1 +, there's another 3(1 + until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9 because each time you have an opening parenthesis, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9:1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, I think I did 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, but let me check my computations step by step again, because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me check each layer again to be sure.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Let me verify that multiplication again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is a geometric series. Wait, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLet me think: the expression is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}\n\nSo, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a geometric progression.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be solved as a linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe standard form is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_i = A*3^i + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait, in our case, a_1 corresponds to the first layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, when i=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, substituting i=1 into the general solution:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer i, the value is (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the first few layers.\n\nFor i=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as a_1=4.\n\nFor i=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, as a_2=13.\n\nFor i=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, as a_3=40.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, but since it's nested 9 times, the formula approach is more efficient.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each layer is another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward.

Then, the next one is (1 + 3*(Level 2)).\n\nThis pattern continues until the outermost parentheses, which would be Level 9.\n\nSo, let me start computing each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364, let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: Let's compute that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nNow, 3*9841. Let's compute that:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3*(Level 9). So after computing Level 9, we have 29524, but that's just the innermost part. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(...Level 9...). So after computing Level 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. Let me clarify the structure.\n\nWait, actually, when I was computing Level 1 to Level 9, each Level was the inner expression. So the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So after computing Level 9 as 29524, we have 3*(29524).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because when I computed Level 9, I thought it was the innermost part, but actually, each Level corresponds to a step in the expression. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first innermost parentheses, then each time it's 1 + 3*(previous expression). So each level adds another layer. Let me count how many times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Level 1\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n2. (1 + 3*(Level 1)) \u2192 Level 2\n\n3. (1 + 3*(Level 2)) \u2192 Level 3\n\n4. (1 + 3*(Level 3)) \u2192 Level 4\n\n5. (1 + 3*(Level 4)) \u2192 Level 5\n\n6. (1 + 3*(Level 5)) \u2192 Level 6\n\n7. (1 + 3*(Level 6)) \u2192 Level 7\n\n8. (1 + 3*(Level 7)) \u2192 Level 8\n\n9. (1 + 3*(Level 8)) \u2192 Level 9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So after computing Level 9, which is (1 + 3*(Level 8)) = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Level 9, I got 29524, but that was after adding 1 to 3*(Level 8). So, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the counting. Let me try to compute each level again, but more carefully.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, compute 3*29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3*524 = 1572\n\nSo, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nAlternatively, compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the Level computations.\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the right number of levels. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first level. Then each additional (1 + 3*(...)) adds a new level, so 9 levels in total, right? So when I computed up to Level 9, that's correct, and then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each level, but since there are only 9 levels, it's manageable.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that each Level n is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nSo, L(1) = 4\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nL(3) =1 + 3*13=40\n\nL(4)=1 + 3*40=121\n\nL(5)=1 + 3*121=364\n\nL(6)=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nL(7)=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nL(8)=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nL(9)=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), which is a linear recurrence. The solution would be L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution L_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K =1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nBut perhaps I can check this formula again to make sure.\n\nSo, if L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then for n=1, L(1)= (3^2 -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nThus, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level as follows, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n- Level 1: \\(1 + 3\\)\n- Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 1}\\)\n- Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 2}\\)\n- And so on, up to Level 9.\n\nWe compute each level step by step:\n\n1.

Let me write it out again to see it clearly:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses and threes. Okay, so the structure is a series of 1s and 3s, with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to the next. It seems like a nested expression where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me try to parse this from the inside out.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the expression is 1+3. So, let's compute that first:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So that would be:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, we have 1 plus 3 times the previous result, right? So each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, is that correct? Let me check. So each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous value.\n\nSo, let's list each layer step by step.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me see how many times this happens. The expression is written as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each layer wraps another (1 + 3*(...)) around it. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each layer adds another set, so starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me try to count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. The entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. Then, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until we have nine layers in total.\n\nWait, let me check. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. There are nine opening parentheses, so that would mean nine layers? Wait, no, because each (1 + 3(...) starts a new layer, so starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, let me confirm how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first ( after the initial 3, each ( starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo that's nine opening parentheses, meaning nine layers. So each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which was 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a new layer, starting from the innermost. So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So how many layers? Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, nine layers inside, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe it's a geometric series or something, but it seems like each layer is just 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each time, it's a linear recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nIf we have a nested expression like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) with n layers, then each layer can be represented as a_n = a + b*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = a.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 3, and n = 9 layers inside, then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (b^n - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found, but perhaps for small n, it's easier to compute step by step.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that each a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, for n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe a different formula. Let me try to find the pattern.\n\nLooking at the a_n values:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = C*3^n + particular solution.\n\nTo find the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's check for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous result). After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), with nine layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9.\n\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me write it down again to see it clearly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of expressions. So, let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses seem to be (1 + 3). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 + 3 multiplied by another 3, so I think there are nine layers in total. That's a lot, but manageable if I do one at a time.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check that. The innermost was the ninth layer, so replacing that gives me the eighth layer now as (1 + 3*4). Hmm, maybe I should write each step separately to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me number each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is (1 + 3*(next layer)). So, perhaps I should work from the inside out, starting with the innermost and moving outward, updating each layer as I go.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute L2: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute L3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute L4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute L5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute L6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute L7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute L8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute L9: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times the outermost layer, right? So, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, I need to multiply it by 3.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524\n\nCompute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems like a big number. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check L9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me compute that again:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should check each step again.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the counting.

That's L2.\n\nThen, L3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't skip any layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, each time wrapping another 1 + 3 around it. So, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...).

So, 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed L1 to L9, I got L9 as 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because 88572 seems quite large, and perhaps I made a miscalculation in the layers.\n\nLet me compute each layer again, step by step, more carefully.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, L9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check if I have 9 layers. Each time I computed L1 to L9, each layer was 1 + 3*(previous). So, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nAlternatively, this is a geometric series. Maybe I can model it that way.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my computation, L1 was 4, L2=13, etc. So, perhaps it's a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, let's test it:\n\na_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found as follows.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the ninth layer, a_9, is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1.\n\nThe sum can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, perhaps I can express it as 3*( (3^{9} -1)/2 ).\n\nWait, but earlier, I saw that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This forms a geometric progression where the nth term can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It seems like each step involves multiplying 3 by something that starts with 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. So, maybe it's a repeating pattern or something that can be simplified step by step.\n\nLet me try to break it down from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, first layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let's compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(first layer result) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so the second layer gives us 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the second layer result.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, third layer is 40.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40.\n\nCalculating: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, let me double-check that: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 is indeed 364. Okay, moving on.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\nCalculating 3*364: Let's break that down. 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCalculating 3*3280: Let's see, 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication again. 3*9841: Maybe another way to compute it. 9841 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit.\n\n9841\n*   3\n------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 1 + 29523 is indeed 29524.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12.\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many steps.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems correct. Let me verify one or two of the multiplications again to be sure.\n\nFor example, step 6: 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524: As above, 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Here are the key steps:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result in the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

It seems like each layer is 3 times something, and that something is 1 plus another similar expression. So, maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are here. Each opening parenthesis is a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3( result from step 1 )\n3. Then the next one: 1 + 3( result from step 2 )\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. Each time it's 3(1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first layer is 3(1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n- And so on.\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: I can see that each time it's 3(1 + 3(...)), so let's count how many times that happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is the last part: (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then the next is 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Continuing this way, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3s multiplied. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as a recursive expression. Each time, it's 3*(1 + previous expression). So maybe I can define it as a function where each step depends on the previous one.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let\u2019s say:\n\nLet\u2019s start from the innermost layer:\n\nLet\u2019s define a1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, the next layer out is a2 = 1 + 3*a1\n\nThen, a3 = 1 + 3*a2\n\nAnd so on, until a9, since I think there are 9 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is 9, because each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another 3*(1 + ...). So how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach 3(1 + ... is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3. Each time, it's 3(1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2013 that's the first layer\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2013 second layer\n3. And so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3s multiplied:\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 inside is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside everything.\n2. Then each 3 inside is another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times we have 3 multiplied. Let me see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier inside the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each step out adds another 3*(1 + ...).

I started with a1 as the innermost, then a2, up to a9, which would be the ninth layer. Then the final result is 3*a9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so perhaps the total number of layers is 9, and then the final result is 3 times a9.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 \u2192 that's the innermost, a1 = 4\n2. Then 3*(1 + a1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 \u2192 but wait, no, in my previous step, I defined a2 as 1 + 3*a1, which is 1 + 3*4 = 13. So perhaps each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so perhaps each a_n is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me clarify.\n\nIf each layer is 3*(1 + previous expression), then the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer out is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Wait, but this seems different from what I did before.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252\n\nWait, but this is different from my first calculation where I had 88572. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to be precise in how I define each layer. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nNow, the expression at this point is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I had 88572, which was different. So I must have made a mistake in how I defined the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether each layer is 3*(1 + previous) or 1 + 3*(previous). Let me check the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nSo, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but in my first calculation, I was adding 1 + 3*previous, which seems to have given a different result. So I think I confused the structure. The correct approach is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 4\n\nThen each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), so each of these is a layer. So starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So the outermost is 3*(...), so the total number of layers is 9, each being 3*(1 + previous).\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I had 9 layers, but I think I misapplied the formula because I was adding 1 + 3*previous instead of 3*(1 + previous). So that's where I went wrong.\n\nSo, to correct that, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nSo, let me recast the calculation correctly:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So the outermost is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to see if the approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, that's 3 layers.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nWait, but according to the formula, Layer1: 4, Layer2:15, Layer3:48, then the outermost would be 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, but according to my previous approach, the outermost is 3*(Layer3) = 3*48 = 144, which is different. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, in the expression 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), the number of layers is 3. Let me compute it step by step:\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen, moving out: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nThen, the outermost: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, but according to my initial approach, I would have stopped at Layer3 = 48, then multiplied by 3 to get 144, which is wrong because the correct result is 147.\n\nSo, this indicates that my initial approach was wrong. Instead, each layer is 3*(1 + previous), but the outermost layer is also part of the count.\n\nWait, in the expression 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is 3, starting from the innermost. So, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), and the outermost is the third layer.\n\nWait, but in the computation, we have:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 48\n\nBut then the entire expression is Layer3, which is 48, but according to the manual computation, the result is 147. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, no, in the expression 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, but according to the structure, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(4))).\n\nSo, innermost is 4, then 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then 3*(1 + 15) = 48, then 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, so in this case, the number of layers is 4? Or 3?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), so the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is 3, not 4. So perhaps the outermost is the third layer.\n\nWait, but in the computation, we have:\n\n- Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n- Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 48) = 147, which would be Layer4.\n\nWait, but the original expression only has three 3*(1 + ...) layers. So perhaps I'm overcounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer, and the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier.\n\nIn the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), there are three 3*(...) layers:\n\n1. The innermost: 3*(1 + 3) = 12? Wait, no, that's not correct because the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, and then each layer is 3*(1 + previous).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nLet me take a step back.\n\nLet me define f(n) as the value of the expression with n layers.\n\nSo, f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but in the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which has three layers, the result is 147, not f(3) as defined above.\n\nWait, perhaps my function definition is off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(n) represents the value after n layers, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(5) = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*16 = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*49 = 147\n\nSo, in this case, the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) would be f(4) = 147.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the number of layers is 3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, perhaps the function f(n) is defined as the value after n layers, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 147\n\nThus, the expression with 3 layers would be f(4) = 147.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent because the number of layers in the expression is 3, but the function f(n) is defined such that f(n) corresponds to n+1 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the number of layers as the number of times 3*(1 + ...) is applied. So, in the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), we have three instances of 3*(1 + ...), so n=3.\n\nThus, f(3) would be:\n\nf(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nBut when I compute the expression manually, I get 147, so there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the function f(n) should start from the innermost as f(0) = 1 + 3 = 4, then f(1) = 3*(1 + f(0)) = 15, f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 48, f(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 147. So, for n layers, it's f(n) where n starts from 0.\n\nIn that case, the expression with 3 layers would be f(3) = 147.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, which has 9 layers, we would compute f(9), starting from f(0) = 4.\n\nSo, let me try that approach.\n\nLet me define f(0) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(1) = 3*(1 + f(0)) = 3*(5) = 15\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(16) = 48\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(49) = 147\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(148) = 444\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(445) = 1335\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1336) = 4008\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(4009) = 12027\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(12028) = 36084\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(36085) = 108255\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I got f(9) = 36084, which would be for n=8 if starting from f(0). So, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. So, if f(n) is defined as starting from f(0) = 4, then f(9) would be the result.\n\nSo, let's compute f(0) to f(9):\n\nf(0) = 4\n\nf(1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nSo, the result would be f(9) = 108255.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 108252, which is close but not the same. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition somewhere.\n\nLet me recompute f(8):\n\nf(7) = 12027\n\nSo, f(8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*(12028) = 36084\n\nThen, f(9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = ?\n\nLet me compute 36085 * 3:\n\n36085 * 3:\n\n3*30000 = 90000\n\n3*6000 = 18000 \u2192 Total so far: 108000\n\n3*80 = 240 \u2192 Total: 108240\n\n3*5 = 15 \u2192 Total: 108255\n\nYes, so f(9) = 108255.\n\nTherefore, the result is 108255.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 108252, which is incorrect. So, the correct result is 108255.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nEach layer is defined by f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1))\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nWe can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(0) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\nf(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 3\n\nWe can solve this using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution:\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 3\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 3\n\n-2A = 3\n\nA = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(0) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^0 - 3/2\n\n4 = C*1 - 3/2\n\nC = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nSo, the solution is f(n) = (11/2)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(n) = (11*3^n - 3)/2\n\nNow, let's compute f(9):\n\nf(9) = (11*3^9 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, f(9) = (11*19683 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n11*19683 = (10*19683) + (1*19683) = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nThen, subtract 3: 216,513 - 3 = 216,510\n\nDivide by 2: 216,510 / 2 = 108,255\n\nSo, f(9) = 108,255.\n\nThis matches the step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 108,255.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step approach, I had 108,252, which was incorrect due to a miscalculation. The correct result is 108,255.\n\nSo, the answer is 108,255.\n\nWait, but let me check again with the step-by-step approach:\n\nf(0) = 4\n\nf(1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the result is 108,255.\n\nI think this is the correct answer. The confusion earlier was due to miscounting the layers and how the recurrence was applied. By using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrived at the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWe can solve this by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation. Each layer is defined by f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)) with f(0) = 4. Solving the recurrence gives the result f(9) = 108,255.\n\n$\\boxed{108255}$"

Let me try to parse it step by step because it looks a bit complicated at first glance.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of threes and ones. Okay, so I see that it's a series of 3 multiplied by something, and inside each of those, there's a 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. It seems like it's a recursive or nested structure, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nLet me try to break it down. Let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me write down each step as I work my way outwards.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3.\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.\n\n3. Next level out: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13 first, which is 39, then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Moving out another level: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). So 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute 3*121: 363. Then 1 + 363 is 364.\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). So 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost level: 3*(result from step 9). So 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because when I broke down 29524, I think I might have made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should compute 29524*3 directly.\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nLet me verify this because 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572. Let me check 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo the number is 88572. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, stepping through each level:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally: 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. It's easy to make a mistake with so many steps. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nYes, each step checks out. So I think the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here to compute it without expanding each step, but given that it's only 9 levels deep, expanding step by step seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a general formula.\n\nWait, another thought: each time we have 1 + 3\u00d7(next level). Let me see if each step is just multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but in reverse. Wait, no, because each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a0 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen a1 = 1 + 3*a0.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1.\n\nAnd so on, up to a8, since there are 9 levels of nesting.\n\nSo, starting from a0, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWe can write this as a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo when n=0, a0 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify this: a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=8 (since we start from a0 and go up to a8, which is the result before the final multiplication by 3), let's compute a8.\n\na8 = (9*3^8 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a8 = (9*6561 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 9*6561: 6561*9.\n\nWell, 6561*10=65610, minus 6561 gives 65610 - 6561 = 59049.\n\nSo, a8 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3*a8 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same result, confirming that the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nThis method is more efficient and less error-prone because it reduces the problem to a formula, avoiding repetitive calculations.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 levels, both methods are manageable, but the recurrence formula is better for larger problems or when a general term is needed.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 + 3 times the result of the next innermost expression. Using a step-by-step approach or recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we find the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Expression:** Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Work Outwards:** Each subsequent level is computed as 1 + 3 \u00d7 (result from the previous step):\n   - 1 + 3 \u00d7 4 = 13\n   - 1 + 3 \u00d7 13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3 \u00d7 40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3 \u00d7 121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3 \u00d7 364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3 \u00d7 1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3 \u00d7 3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3 \u00d7 9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " It's this nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nOkay, so it's a chain of 3s multiplied by expressions that have 1 plus 3 times another expression, and this goes on multiple times. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. It looks like this:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + something). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Then, 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. And so on, until we have 9 layers in total, I think.\n\nWait, let me check. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times 3(1+3... occurs. I think there are 9 instances of 3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)\n2. Then another 3(1+3(...)\n3. And so on until the 9th one.\n\nWait, actually, let's see. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). The innermost part is (1 + 3), then each step out adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s before a parenthesis:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then another 3 inside, so that's the second layer.\n- Continuing, I think there are 9 layers in total because each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me check the structure:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, each time adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. So, to compute this, I should start from the innermost layer and compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start computing from the innermost part and work my way out.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but hold on, in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each layer is 3*(1 + result of the inner layer). So, starting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting over:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, according to this, the final result is 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me check again because sometimes when I do this step by step, I might miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of times I applied the 3*(1 + ...). Starting from L1 as the innermost, I have 9 layers, so L9 is the outermost. So, the final result is L9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by computing each layer again step by step, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent each time. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern here. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + previous result). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, same result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let's see if we can find a formula for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolve for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2:\n\n8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Wait, but earlier I had a_4 as 147. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, no, wait, in my earlier calculation, a_4 was 147, but according to this formula, it's 444. That can't be right. So, I must have made a mistake in deriving the formula.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, in the recurrence, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nBut in my general solution, I have a_n = (11*3^{n} - 3)/2, but when I plug in n=1, I get 4, which is correct, but n=2 gives 15, which is correct, but n=3 gives 48, which is correct, but n=4 would be (11*81 -3)/2 = (891 -3)/2= 888/2=444, which is not matching my earlier calculation where a_4 was 147. So, clearly, I made a mistake in the recurrence.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I misapplied the initial conditions or the recurrence is different.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, when I defined a_n, I considered a_1 as the innermost (1 + 3) =4, then a_2 as 3*(1 + a_1)=15, a_3=3*(1 + a_2)=48, and so on up to a_9.\n\nBut in the formula I derived, a_n = (11*3^{n} -3)/2, when n=1, a_1=4, which is correct. But when n=2, a_2=15, correct. n=3, a_3=48, correct. n=4, a_4=147. But according to the formula, a_4=(11*81 -3)/2= (891-3)/2=444, which is not matching. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the recurrence. Let me try again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3\n\n-2K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2:\n\n8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3C\n\nThus, C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nNow, let's compute a_4 using this formula:\n\na_4 = (11*3^{3} -3)/2 = (11*27 -3)/2 = (297 -3)/2=294/2=147. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, earlier when I used n=4, I thought it was giving me 444, but that was incorrect because I must have miscalculated. Let me recalculate:\n\na_4 = (11*3^{4-1} -3)/2 = (11*27 -3)/2 = (297 -3)/2=294/2=147. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_5=(11*81 -3)/2=(891-3)/2=888/2=444. Correct.\n\na_6=(11*243 -3)/2=(2673-3)/2=2670/2=1335. Correct.\n\na_7=(11*729 -3)/2=(8019-3)/2=8016/2=4008. Correct.\n\na_8=(11*2187 -3)/2=(24057-3)/2=24054/2=12027. Correct.\n\na_9=(11*6561 -3)/2=(72171-3)/2=72168/2=36084. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the final result after 9 layers is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again without the formula, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 =15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 +15)=3*16=48\n\nLayer4:3*(1+48)=3*49=147\n\nLayer5:3*(1+147)=3*148=444\n\nLayer6:3*(1+444)=3*445=1335\n\nLayer7:3*(1+1335)=3*1336=4008\n\nLayer8:3*(1+4008)=3*4009=12027\n\nLayer9:3*(1+12027)=3*12028=36084\n\nYes, same result. So, I'm confident the answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost part outward, we compute the value as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 15\\)\n3. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 48\\)\n4. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 147\\)\n5. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 444\\)\n6. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 1335\\)\n7. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 4008\\)\n8. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 12027\\)\n9. Outermost layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 36084\\)\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me write it down step by step:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1 to L9, starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me check again. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until there are 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)), and each subsequent parenthesis is another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3))\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, I need to compute from L1 to L9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to L9, which gave me 29524, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, because each L corresponds to a layer, starting from the innermost. So, let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nLet me write out the layers step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote the innermost as layer 1, then each outer layer as layer 2, 3, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12, but wait, no. Wait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Wait, no, it's the other way around. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nThen, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...). So, after computing the innermost layers up to Layer9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). Wait, no, because Layer9 is already the result of the innermost layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify the structure again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, Layer1 = 4.\n\nLayer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing all the inner layers up to Layer9 = 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I stopped at Layer9 = 29524, which is the result of the innermost layers, but the entire expression is 3 times that.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, after computing Layer9 = 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 total so far: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 total: 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n24*3 = 72 \u2192 total: 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)), then each subsequent parenthesis is another layer.\n\nLet's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3))\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, Layer9 is the innermost, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, no, actually, the structure is 3*(Layer1), where Layer1 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), and so on, with Layer9 being the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the layers reversed. Let me try to index them correctly.\n\nLet me denote the innermost as Layer1, then each outer layer as Layer2, Layer3, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer1), where Layer1 is the innermost. So, I think that's correct.\n\nLet me check with a smaller example to make sure my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose the problem was 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1+3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, the entire expression: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSimilarly, if I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), innermost is 4, then 1 + 3*4 =13, then 3*13=39.\n\nWait, but in my earlier problem, I had 9 layers, leading to 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation of Layer9.\n\nLet me recompute Layer9 step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7       3\n\n--------\n\nFirst, 4*3=12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers.

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses and threes. Let me write it down to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of layers! It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3(something), and each time it's multiplied by 3. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards step by step. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me make sure. Each time, the innermost (1 + 3) is being replaced. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous one. Let me number the layers to keep track.\n\nLet's label each layer starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then moving outward as Layer 2, up to Layer 9 because there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, final result = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, it's 88572. Hmm, that's what I got before. But wait, when I did the step-by-step addition earlier, I thought 29524 * 3 was 88572, but let me confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in computing the layers because when I was going through each layer, I might have miscalculated somewhere. Let me double-check each layer to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the structure. The original expression is 3*(...), where the inside is 1 + 3*(...), which itself is 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we compute the next layer by 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the process is correct: compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nTherefore, I think my final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step without layers, just expanding each parenthesis.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nExpression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time replacing the innermost expression.\n\nLet me write each step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is the last (1 + 3). So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). So, let's compute each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe a better way is to start from the innermost and work outwards, keeping track of each step.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nLet me define each nested expression as E_n, where n is the level.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, so that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\), and the final result is multiplied by 3. \n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. It looks like each part is 3 times something inside parentheses, and inside each parentheses, it's 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of operations starting from the innermost part and working outward.\n\nLet me try to break it down. Since there are multiple layers, I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually makes things easier with nested expressions.\n\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1+3(...), that's a layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nIt seems like each layer adds another 1+3(...) until we reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me see how many 1+3(...) there are.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers? Let me check.\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from 1, each time we add another layer. Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, the outermost is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, it's another 1 + 3(...), and so on, until the innermost part.\n\nLet me count how many times 3 is multiplied. Each time we have a 3 multiplying a parentheses, so the number of 3s is equal to the number of layers. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3. Then, each layer adds a 3 multiplied by the next parentheses.\n\nSo, from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nSo, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the outermost, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). Then inside that, another 3*(...), and so on until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many 3s are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost is 1+3, so each layer adds a 3. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Each time we have 3*(...), so starting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3*(...)\n...\nContinuing until the innermost, which is just 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the number of 3s as multipliers is equal to the number of layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until layer n, which is the outermost.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...), and each time we add a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\nAfter each 3, there's an opening parenthesis, except for the last one. So, let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside all the parentheses.\n\nThen, inside that, we have 1 + 3*(...), so that's the second 3.\n\nThen inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), so that's the third 3.\n\nContinuing this way, how many 3s are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times 3( appears:\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nEach \"3(\" is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3( is a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 times \"3(\", but the innermost is just 1+3, so maybe the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each time we have a 3 multiplying a (1 + 3*...), so the number of layers is 9.\n\nSo, let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost is 1+3, which is L1.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen the outermost expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8).\n\nSo, we have 9 layers, each defined as Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, starting from L1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1+3, which is L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, until L9.\n\nThen the outermost expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me list each layer again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check one of the intermediate steps again, say L5:\n\nL4 = 121, so L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is defined by Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Lk.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Lk = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is Lk - 3*Lk-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Lk^h = C*3^k.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Lk^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Lk = C*3^k - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k=1, L1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nLk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^(k+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, Lk = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nL1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor k=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor k=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor k=4:\n\nL4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Lk = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have L9, let's compute L9 using the formula:\n\nL9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, since Lk = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2, and the outermost expression is 3*L9, which is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n3*L9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11:\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=59049*3=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, another way to compute the result is (3^11 -3)/2=88572.\n\nThis confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3(something), and each something is another similar expression. So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That makes sense because each parenthesis depends on the one inside it. \n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. I'll number each layer from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 to 9, maybe?

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find D such that D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, Layer 1 is 4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, Layer 4 is 121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I consider that the outermost expression is 3*a_9, then:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
