    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, and it looks a bit intimidating at first glance. Let me try to break it down step by step. The problem is:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. Let me try to visualize this structure.\n\nSo, the expression is a series of 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by another expression). It seems like each layer is similar but nested deeper. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3*(result of the previous step)\n3. This repeats several times.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the left, I see the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Each time, the expression inside is another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the first 3(1+3(...)), each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- The first layer: 3(1+3(...\n- Then, each layer adds another 1+3(...\n\nCounting them: Let's see, after the first 3, there are 8 more layers because I can see 8 sets of (1+3(...)) before it closes. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each step adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nThis continues until Layer 9, I think.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nAfter the first 3, the first opening parenthesis starts Layer 1. Then, inside that, there's another opening parenthesis for Layer 2, and so on. Let me count how many opening parentheses there are after the first 3:\n\n- After the first 3, the expression is (1+3(...))\n- Inside that, it's (1+3(...))\n- Repeating this, how many times?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses: the first 3 is followed by 8 opening parentheses because each layer adds one. Let me check:\n\n- The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 Layer 2\n...\nContinuing until Layer 9? Wait, let me check the exact number.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to work from the inside out. Let's start computing from the innermost parentheses and move outward step by step.\n\nSo, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., Ln, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1)\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(L2)\n\nAnd so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is 3*(L8), since there are 8 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. Then, 1+3*(Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. This continues until Layer 9, because I can see 8 opening parentheses after the first 3, which would mean 8 layers, but let me count.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to write down each step.\n\nLet me start from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the outermost expression is 3*(...), where ... is the result of the innermost layers.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) =3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers again. Because if I have 8 layers after the initial 3, that would mean 8 layers inside, so the initial 3 is multiplied by Layer8.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- After the first 3, the first ( is at position 1, then each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3))\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses, but the last one is just (1+3), which is the innermost. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me check the structure again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1+3) =4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*(Layer2)=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*(Layer3)=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*(Layer4)=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*(Layer5)=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*(Layer6)=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*(Layer7)=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*(Layer8)=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nBut let me check if I have 9 layers. Because the expression starts with 3*(Layer9), and Layer9 is the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of 1+3 expressions. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 instances:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n- Then, each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so how many times does 1+3 appear?\n\nLet me count the number of '1+3's:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, another (1+3(...\n3. Repeating until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of 3s. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write down each step more carefully.\n\nLet me start by labeling each layer:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers. Because the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), and each time we have another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of times 1+3 appears is 9 times. So, Layer1 to Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me write it down step by step:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of '1 + 3 * (...)' segments.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nHow many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses because each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 8.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier count. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...)), which is Layer1.\n\nInside Layer1, we have another (1+3(...)), which is Layer2.\n\nContinuing until Layer8, which would be the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, so perhaps there are 8 layers, meaning that the outermost is 3*(Layer8).\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is Layer1.\n\n- Inside Layer1, another (1+3(...)), which is Layer2.\n\n- This continues until Layer8, which is the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, that would mean we have 8 layers inside the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, the computation would be:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer8)=3*9841=29523\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88572, which was 3*29524, but now I'm getting 3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- After the first 3, the first ( is at position 1, then each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, meaning there are 8 layers inside.\n\nWait, but that would mean Layer1 to Layer8, with Layer8 being the innermost.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. So, the first ( after 3 starts Layer1, then inside that, another ( starts Layer2, and so on until Layer8.\n\nSo, the innermost is Layer8: 1+3=4\n\nThen, Layer7:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer6:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer5:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer4:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer3:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer2:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer1:1+3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer1)=3*9841=29523\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the layer numbering. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me start from the innermost and work outward, computing each step.\n\nInnermost expression:\n\nStep1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nStep2: 1 + 3*(Step1) =1 + 3*4=13\n\nStep3:1 +3*(Step2)=1 +3*13=40\n\nStep4:1 +3*40=121\n\nStep5:1 +3*121=364\n\nStep6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nStep7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nStep8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nStep9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Step9)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but if I count the number of steps, I have 9 steps, which would mean 9 layers. But earlier, I thought there were 8 layers because of the number of opening parentheses. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Each time, we have 1+3*(...), so how many times does 1+3 appear?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n...\nUp to the outermost.\n\nLet me count the number of '1+3's:\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of '1+3's is 9, meaning 9 layers.\n\nWait, because the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, we have 8 layers of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from how I'm counting the layers. Let me try to write the expression as a tree.\n\nThe outermost is 3*(...), where the ... is (1+3*(...)).\n\nThat inner ... is another (1+3*(...)), and so on, until the innermost is (1+3).\n\nSo, the number of times we have (1+3*(...)) is 8 times, with the innermost being (1+3).\n\nTherefore, the number of layers is 8, with the innermost being Layer1: (1+3)=4\n\nThen Layer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer8)=3*9841=29523\n\nWait, but earlier I had 9 layers, resulting in 88572. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I should write out the entire expression step by step, without assigning layers, just compute each nested part.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute the innermost parentheses first: 1+3=4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n1+3*(4)=1+12=13\n\nNext layer out:1+3*(13)=1+39=40\n\nNext:1+3*(40)=1+120=121\n\nNext:1+3*(121)=1+363=364\n\nNext:1+3*(364)=1+1092=1093\n\nNext:1+3*(1093)=1+3279=3280\n\nNext:1+3*(3280)=1+9840=9841\n\nNext:1+3*(9841)=1+29523=29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572\n\nWait, but that would mean there are 8 layers after the initial 3, making it 9 layers in total, including the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*(4)=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*(13)=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*(40)=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*(121)=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*(364)=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*(1093)=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*(3280)=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*(9841)=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nBut wait, looking at the original expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, which would mean 8 layers, so Layer1 to Layer8.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the initial 3 is multiplied by Layer8, which is the result after 8 layers.\n\nWait, let me check the structure again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), where the ... is another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...) is 8 times, meaning 8 layers inside the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, the innermost is Layer1:1+3=4\n\nThen Layer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer8)=3*9841=29523\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I had 9 layers, leading to 88572.\n\nI think the confusion is arising from whether the initial 3 is considered a layer or not. Let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(Layer8)\n\nWhere Layer8 is the result after 8 layers of 1+3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*(Layer8)=3*9841=29523\n\nBut wait, let me check the original expression again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to write the expression with each layer explicitly.\n\nLet me denote the innermost as Layer1:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*(Layer1)=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(Layer4)=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(Layer5)=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(Layer6)=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(Layer7)=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(Layer8)=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer9), which would mean that the initial 3 is multiplied by the result of 9 layers.\n\nBut looking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by 8 opening parentheses, meaning that the innermost is Layer8, not Layer9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nBut wait, the original expression only has 8 layers inside the initial 3, so Layer9 doesn't exist. Therefore, the correct computation is up to Layer8, which is 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, we have 8 instances of 1+3*(...). So, 8 layers.\n\nTherefore, the innermost is (1+3)=4 (Layer1)\n\nThen, moving out:\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer8)=3*9841=29523\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to Layer9, I got 88572, but that would be if there are 9 layers inside the initial 3.\n\nI think the confusion is arising because I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nAfter the initial 3, the number of opening parentheses is 8, meaning 8 layers.\n\nTherefore, the computation should be up to Layer8, resulting in 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523.\n\nBut wait, let me check again.\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, that's 8 layers inside, right?

So, the layers are all inside the initial 3's parentheses.\n\nTherefore, the initial 3 is multiplied by the result of 8 layers of (1+3*(...)), which is 9841.\n\nTherefore, 3*9841=29523.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach.\n\nLet me try to write the expression as a sum.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*9841=29523\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88572, which was 3*29524. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times 1+3 appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of '1+3's:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is Layer1.\n\n- Inside Layer1, another (1+3(...)), which is Layer2.\n\n- This continues until Layer8, which is the innermost (1+3).\n\nTherefore, there are 8 layers inside the initial 3, leading to Layer8=9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*9841=29523.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29523.\n"

Wait, so now I'm confused because I'm getting two different results depending on how I count the levels.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to carefully count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs inside.\n\nLet me write the expression step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level).

So, I must have miscounted the levels earlier.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong before? I think I counted 9 levels, but actually, it's 8 levels inside, so the outermost is 3*(Level 8), which is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, let me verify this with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, we have a term that's 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, this is a geometric series or a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at each level n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I first did it, I went up to Level 9, which gave me 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. But that must be incorrect because I miscounted the levels.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 29523.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by computing each level again step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThen, the outermost expression: 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3 = 3.\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29.\n\nSo, 9841 * 3 = 29523.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29523.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by counting one extra level, which led me to the wrong answer. So, after carefully counting and verifying each step, I can confidently say that the result is 29523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outwards step by step.\n\nThe problem is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level as follows, starting from the innermost expression:\n\n1. **Level 1**: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. **Level 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Level 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Level 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Level 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Level 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Level 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Level 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost expression:\n\\[ 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[ \\boxed{29523} \\]"

So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list them as layers from inside out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nHmm, 3*29,524. Let me compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000\n\nBut 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 476 * 3 is 1,428, so 90,000 - 1,428 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000+2,400=29,400 +120=29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing the expression another way, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1).\n\nWait, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1.\n\nSo, applying the formula:\n\na_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na_1 = 4\n\nc = 1\n\nk = 3\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/(3-1) = 1/2\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nSimplify further:\n\n(9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) ) = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (9/2)*(3^{n-1})\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\na_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nBut let me check for n=1:\n\na_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = (9/2 - 1/2) = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\na_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=3:\n\na_3 = (9/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2\n\nCompute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = let's compute 6561*9:\n\n6000*9=54,000\n\n500*9=4,500\n\n60*9=540\n\n1*9=9\n\nSo, 54,000 + 4,500 = 58,500 + 540 = 59,040 + 9 = 59,049.\n\nSo, 59,049 / 2 = 29,524.5\n\nThen, a_9 = 29,524.5 - 0.5 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29,524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more using the formula.\n\nSince the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 is 29,524, then 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as 3*(a_9) where a_9 is as computed.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me try to compute the expression step by step, layer by layer, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent every time I compute it. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just check the arithmetic for each step again, because sometimes a small mistake can throw everything off.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300+60=360+3=363. Then, 1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1,080+12=1,092. 1+1,092=1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. 1,093*3: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000+270=3,270+9=3,279. Then, 1+3,279=3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,280*3: 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840. So, 9,000+840=9,840. 1 + 9,840=9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 9,841*3: Let's compute 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000+2,400=29,400+120=29,520+3=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Thus, the final result is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s, and I need to compute the value step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses! It looks like there are eight layers of nesting here. Let me try to break it down from the inside out because that usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, but since we already simplified the innermost part, it's 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nAlright, so the next layer simplifies to 12. Now, moving one more layer out, we have another expression: 1 + that result. So, it's 1 + 12. Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nHmm, okay, so now we have 13. Next layer out is 3 multiplied by this 13. So, 3*13. Let me calculate that:\n\n3 * 13 = 39\n\nAlright, moving on. The next layer is 1 + 39. Let me add those:\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, moving out, we have 3 times 40. Let's compute that:\n\n3 * 40 = 120\n\nNext layer is 1 + 120. That's straightforward:\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nThen, 3 times 121. Let me do that multiplication:\n\n3 * 121 = 363\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 363. Adding those together:\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext up is 3 times 364. Hmm, let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So:\n\n3 * 364 = 1092\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 1092. That's easy:\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nThen, 3 times 1093. Let me calculate that. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So:\n\n3 * 1093 = 3279\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3279. That's:\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nThen, 3 times 3280. Let me compute that. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So:\n\n3 * 3280 = 9840\n\nNext layer is 1 + 9840. That's:\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, 3 times 9841. Let me compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So:\n\n3 * 9841 = 29523\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication because that's a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 9841 times 3:\n\n- 3 * 1 = 3\n- 3 * 4 = 12, carry over the 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, carry over the 2\n- 3 * 9 = 27, plus the carried 2 is 29\n\nSo, writing it down, it should be 29523. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer, we have 1 + 29523. Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by 29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again because 29524 is actually 29,524, so 3 times that should be:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7         3\n----------\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n- 3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 3 * 2 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7\n- 3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n- 3 * 9 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n- 3 * 2 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8\n\nSo, putting it together, we get 88,572. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Let me check my initial calculation:\n\nI broke it down as 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So that's correct. But when I did it digit by digit, I got 88,572 as well. Wait, no, the digit-by-digit method gave me 88,572, which matches the other method. So, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, hold on, 29,524 times 3: Let me compute it another way to be sure.\n\n29,524\n\u00d7         3\n----------\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, reading it from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Wait, but the number is 29,524, so the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought I had 29,524 and then I added 1 to get 29,525, but no, actually, in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + ...), so the innermost was (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so the outermost is 3*(1 + ...). Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly. The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3s outside the parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 3*(1 + ...)\n4. ... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Each 3 is followed by a (1 + ...), so each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of 3s outside the parentheses is 8, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3. So, we have 8 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 8 layers. So, in my earlier calculation, I started from the innermost and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step, ending up with 88,572 as the final result. But let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nLet me write down each step with the corresponding layer:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*4 = 12\n3. Next: 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Next: 3*13 = 39\n5. Next: 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Next: 3*40 = 120\n7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121\n8. Next: 3*121 = 363\n9. Next: 1 + 363 = 364\n10. Next: 3*364 = 1092\n11. Next: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n12. Next: 3*1093 = 3279\n13. Next: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n14. Next: 3*3280 = 9840\n15. Next: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. Next: 3*9841 = 29523\n17. Next: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n18. Next: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 18 steps, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me see: Each time I compute a layer, it's either a 3*(...) or a 1 + (...). Let me try to list each layer more clearly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to number the layers from the innermost to the outermost. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer3) = 3*13 = 39\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer7) = 3*121 = 363\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer8 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer10: 3*(Layer9) = 3*364 = 1092\nLayer11: 1 + Layer10 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer12: 3*(Layer11) = 3*1093 = 3279\nLayer13: 1 + Layer12 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer14: 3*(Layer13) = 3*3280 = 9840\nLayer15: 1 + Layer14 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer16: 3*(Layer15) = 3*9841 = 29523\nLayer17: 1 + Layer16 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nLayer18: 3*(Layer17) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 18 layers, but the original expression only has 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + ...), so that's one layer.\n- Inside that, there's another 3*(1 + ...), so that's two layers.\n- Continuing this way, each opening parenthesis introduces another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, there are 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, I should have 8 layers to compute, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, so perhaps I overcomplicated it earlier by going through 18 layers. Let me try again, this time correctly identifying the 8 layers.\n\nLet me number them from the innermost to the outermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nWait, that's only 8 layers. But the original expression has 8 layers, so the outermost layer is Layer8, which is 3*(1 + ...), which equals 363. But that can't be right because the original expression has 8 layers, so the computation should go further.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out, we have 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Then, 3*13 = 39\n5. Next: 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Then, 3*40 = 120\n7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121\n8. Then, 3*121 = 363\n9. Next: 1 + 363 = 364\n10. Then, 3*364 = 1092\n11. Next: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n12. Then, 3*1093 = 3279\n13. Next: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n14. Then, 3*3280 = 9840\n15. Next: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. Then, 3*9841 = 29523\n17. Next: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n18. Then, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but that's 18 steps, but the original expression only has 8 layers. So, I think I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to visualize the structure.\n\nEach 3 is followed by a (1 + ...), so the expression is a series of 3*(1 + ...) nested 8 times. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the number of layers is 8, so the computation should be done 8 times, each time replacing the innermost expression with the result.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I ended up with 88,572, which seems correct, but I'm just confused about the number of layers. Let me try to compute it step by step again, but this time, I'll keep track of each layer properly.\n\nLet me start over, this time correctly identifying each layer as per the structure:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nWait, so that's only 8 layers, and the result is 363. But that can't be right because the original expression has 8 layers, so the outermost expression would be 3*(1 + ...), which would be Layer8, giving 363. But that seems too small, considering the expression is quite long.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again, counting the number of 3s before each (1 + ...).\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the initial 3 introduces another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The next is another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does 3(1 + ... occur? Let me count the number of times I see \"3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 8 instances of \"3(\" because each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). So, the innermost is the 8th layer, which is (1 + 3). Therefore, we have 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer properly:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nWait, that's only 8 layers, and the result is 363. But that seems too small for an expression that has 8 layers. Let me check my calculation again because I think I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not accounting for the fact that each 3*(1 + ...) is nested inside the previous one. So, after Layer8, there's another layer outside. Wait, no, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), with 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, the initial 3 is the outermost layer, and then each subsequent 3 is nested inside.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, but each time, the result is used in the next outer layer.\n\nLet me try to compute it again, step by step, this time keeping track of each layer properly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer9: 1 + Layer8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer10: 3*(Layer9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nLayer11: 1 + Layer10 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer12: 3*(Layer11) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nLayer13: 1 + Layer12 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer14: 3*(Layer13) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nLayer15: 1 + Layer14 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer16: 3*(Layer15) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nLayer17: 1 + Layer16 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer18: 3*(Layer17) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, now I'm getting 88,572 again, which is consistent with my earlier calculation, but this time, I counted 18 layers, which doesn't match the original expression's structure. So, perhaps the confusion arises from how I'm numbering the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer, starting from the innermost. Since the original expression has 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), the computation should involve 8 layers, not 18. Therefore, I think I'm overcomplicating it by considering each addition and multiplication as separate layers, but actually, each 3*(1 + ...) is a single layer.\n\nSo, let's try again, this time considering each 3*(1 + ...) as a single layer:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nWait, that's only 8 layers, and the result is 9840. But when I computed earlier, I ended up with 88,572. Hmm, so where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\n3. 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\n4. 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\n5. 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\n6. 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\n8. 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\n9. 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\n10. 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers. But the original expression only has 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the confusion is in how I'm counting the layers. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nEach time I see a \"3(\", that's a new layer. So, in the original expression, how many \"3(\" are there after the initial 3?\n\nLet me write the expression with each \"3(\" highlighted:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, each subsequent \"3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, there are 8 instances of \"3(\", meaning 8 layers. Therefore, the innermost layer is the 8th layer, which is (1 + 3). So, let's compute each layer accordingly:\n\nLayer1 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nSo, after 8 layers, the result is 9840. But when I computed earlier, I went beyond that, but perhaps that's incorrect because the original expression only has 8 layers.\n\nWait, but looking back, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer1. Then each subsequent 3(...) is another layer. So, the initial 3 is the outermost layer, and then each \"3(\" introduces a new inner layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the initial 3 is the outermost, and then each \"3(\" is a new inner layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" instances, which is 8. Therefore, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nSo, the result after 8 layers is 9840. But when I computed earlier, I went beyond that, but perhaps that's incorrect because the original expression only has 8 layers. Therefore, the final answer should be 9840.\n\nWait, but let me check the structure again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer1. Then each \"3(\" introduces a new layer. So, there are 8 \"3(\" instances, meaning 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the computation should stop at Layer8, giving 9840.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed 18 layers, I got 88,572, which seems too large, but perhaps that's correct because the expression is deeply nested. Let me try to compute it again, this time correctly identifying the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the initial 3 is not counted as a layer, but each subsequent \"3(\" is a layer. So, with 8 \"3(\" instances, we have 8 layers, each being 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the computation would be:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nSo, after 8 layers, the result"

I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3):\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the result we just got. So the next layer is (1 + 3*4). Wait, no, actually, looking again, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 3*(1 + something). Let me make sure I get the structure right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should number the layers to keep track. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n...\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.

Starting from the left:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3(...))\n- Continuing this way, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers?

So let's count how many times this happens.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to visualize it as a series of nested expressions. Let me try to write each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer starting from the innermost as L1, then L2, up to L9, since there are 9 layers of 3*(...). Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first innermost layer. Then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So the number of layers is 9? Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3's before the innermost (1+3). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is at the outermost layer, then each subsequent layer is another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result). So starting from the innermost, each step is:\n\nCompute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me check: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + something). So each time, you compute the innermost, then work your way out.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outward, each time computing the value of each layer and substituting it into the outer layers.\n\nSo, let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but that seems a bit too large.

Let me go through each step again carefully.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers.\n\nWait, looking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3's before each (1 + ...). Wait, perhaps another approach is to see that each time you have a 3 multiplied by (1 + something), so the number of such 3's is equal to the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does the pattern 3(1 + 3(...) occur? Let's count the number of 3's before the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. Let me confirm by counting the number of 3's in the expression:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), so the number of 3's before that is 9. So, that means we have 9 layers, each being 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the total number of layers is 9, so L1 to L9.\n\nSo, proceeding as before:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the final result is 36084.\n\nBut let me verify each step once again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute the result without having to calculate each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me denote the value at layer n as a_n, where a_1 = 4 (from L1). Then each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3\n\n-2K = 3 => K = -3/2\n\nWait, but that seems odd because our initial terms are all positive. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the particular solution. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, we can write it as:\n\na_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c)\n\nTo find c such that this holds:\n\na_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c\n\nBut from the original equation, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, so:\n\n3*a_{n-1} + 3 + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c\n\nSimplify:\n\n3*a_{n-1} + (3 + c) = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c\n\nThus, 3 + c = 3c => 3 = 2c => c = 3/2\n\nSo, the particular solution is a_n^{(p)} = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nC = (11/2) / 3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nBut let's check this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3:\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - 3/2 = 96/2 = 48, correct.\n\nSo, the general formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3280 * 11 = 36080\n\nThen, 0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo, total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nI think that's correct. To be thorough, let me check one more layer with the formula.\n\nFor n=4, a_4 should be 147.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na_4 = (11/6)*3^4 - 3/2 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 3/2 = 148.5 - 1.5 = 147, correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=5:\n\na_5 = (11/6)*243 - 3/2 = (2673/6) - 1.5 = 445.5 - 1.5 = 444, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works, and the final result is indeed 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each time computing the value and substituting it into the outer layers. Using a step-by-step approach or a derived formula, the final result is found to be:\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses! It looks like each part is similar, so maybe there's a pattern here. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, each time I solve one layer, I move outward. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n... and so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nI think I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. So let's do that.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3. That's easy, that's 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Since the innermost was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(result from previous layer). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nHmm, wait, that's 40. Let me check that again. 3*13 is indeed 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40). So 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120? No, wait, 3*40 is actually 120. So 120 +1 is 121. That seems correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute 3*121 first. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then add 1: 363 + 1 = 364.\n\nWait, that seems big, but okay. Let's keep going.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364. Let's compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 +1 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 +1 = 3280.\n\nWait, that's getting really large. Let me check if I did that correctly. 3*1093: 1093*3. Let's break it down:\n\n1000*3 = 3000\n\n90*3 = 270\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding them together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 3279 +1 is 3280. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 +1 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding them up:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen add 1: 29523 +1 = 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nThen add 1: 88572 +1 = 88573.\n\nWait, that seems huge. Let me check again:\n\n3*29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo 29524*3 is 88572. Then +1 is 88573. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute 3*88573.\n\n88573 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n3*80000 = 240000\n\n3*8000 = 24000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*70 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding them:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nThen add 1: 265719 +1 = 265720.\n\nWait, that's 265,720. Hmm, okay.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(265720). Let's compute 3*265720.\n\n265720 *3.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n200000*3=600000\n\n60000*3=180000\n\n5000*3=15000\n\n700*3=2100\n\n20*3=60\n\n0*3=0\n\nAdding them:\n\n600000 + 180000 = 780000\n\n780000 +15000=795000\n\n795000 +2100=797100\n\n797100 +60=797160\n\n797160 +0=797160\n\nThen add 1: 797160 +1=797161.\n\nWait, so now the outermost expression is 3*(797161). So we have to compute 3*797161.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n700000*3=2,100,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000\n\n7,000*3=21,000\n\n100*3=300\n\n60*3=180\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them:\n\n2,100,000 +270,000=2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 +21,000=2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 +300=2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 +180=2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 +3=2,391,483.\n\nSo the final result is 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. This is a long chain, so it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me go back and check each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\n4. Next:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\n5. Next:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\n6. Next:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\n10. Next:1 +3*29524=1 +88572=88573. Correct.\n\n11. Next:1 +3*88573=1 +265719=265720. Correct.\n\n12. Next:1 +3*265720=1 +797160=797161. Correct.\n\n13. Finally, 3*797161=2,391,483. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So the final answer is 2,391,483.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each step manually. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So it's like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a1, then a2, a3, up to a9, since there are 9 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of parentheses. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. a1 = 1 + 3\n2. a2 = 1 + 3*a1\n3. a3 = 1 + 3*a2\n...\nUp to a9 = 1 + 3*a8\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a9.\n\nSo it's a recurrence relation: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\na1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 =4.\n\nSo 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers after the initial 3, meaning a9 is the innermost expression? Wait, no.\n\nWait, starting from a1 as the innermost, which is 1 +3=4, then a2 is next, up to a9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, actually, let's see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So the innermost is 1 +3, then each layer adds another 1 +3*(...).\n\nSo the number of layers: starting from the innermost, how many times do we have \"1 +3(...)\"? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting after the first 3(, we have:\n\n1 + 3(...), which is 9 layers because each time it's nested 9 times.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" parts.\n\nFrom the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the first one after the initial 3, there are 9 such layers, each nesting deeper. So the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1 +3.\n\nTherefore, the number of layers n is 9. So a9 is the innermost expression, which is 1 +3=4.\n\nWait, no, in my earlier notation, a1 was the innermost, which is 1 +3=4. Then a2 was the next layer, etc., up to a9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, so if n=9, then a9 = (3^{9+1} -1)/2 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step earlier, a9 was 29524, which is correct because when n=9, a9=29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Wait, but in my manual computation earlier, I got 2,391,483. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, in the recurrence, a1 was the innermost, which is 4, then a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my manual computation earlier, I went all the way up to 3*(797161)=2,391,483. That can't be right because the recurrence formula suggests that the entire expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first parenthesis after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n9. (1 + 3(...\n\nSo there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each nested inside the previous one. So the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1 +3=4.\n\nThus, a1=4, a2=13, ..., a9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step computation, I went beyond a9, computing up to 3*(797161). That suggests I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 +3=4\n\nThen each layer:\n\n2. 1 +3*4=13\n\n3. 1 +3*13=40\n\n4. 1 +3*40=121\n\n5. 1 +3*121=364\n\n6. 1 +3*364=1093\n\n7. 1 +3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1 +3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1 +3*9841=29524\n\n10. Then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's only 9 layers, but in my initial computation, I went up to 13 layers. That's where I went wrong. I thought there were more layers, but actually, there are only 9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many closing parentheses are there? Let me check:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the closing parentheses: each \"1 +3(...))\" has two closing parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 +3)), then each layer adds two more. Wait, maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 +3)) is the first layer.\n\nThen each layer adds another (1 +3(...)).\n\nSo the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought.\n\nTherefore, the correct result should be 3*a9=88572.\n\nBut in my manual computation earlier, I went up to 3*(797161)=2,391,483, which is way larger. That suggests I added more layers than there actually are.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nEach time I see a \"1 +3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first one after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 +3(...\n2. (1 +3(...\n3. (1 +3(...\n4. (1 +3(...\n5. (1 +3(...\n6. (1 +3(...\n7. (1 +3(...\n8. (1 +3(...\n9. (1 +3(...\n\nSo 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is 1 +3=4, then each subsequent layer is 1 +3*previous.\n\nTherefore, after 9 layers, a9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nSo where did I go wrong earlier? I think I miscounted the number of layers, thinking there were more than 9, so I ended up computing beyond a9.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with the recurrence formula.\n\nGiven a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo my initial manual computation was incorrect because I thought there were more layers, but actually, there are only 9 layers after the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check by computing step by step up to a9.\n\nCompute a1 to a9:\n\na1=1 +3=4\n\na2=1 +3*a1=1 +12=13\n\na3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40\n\na4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121\n\na5=1 +3*a4=1 +363=364\n\na6=1 +3*a5=1 +1092=1093\n\na7=1 +3*a6=1 +3279=3280\n\na8=1 +3*a7=1 +9840=9841\n\na9=1 +3*a8=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo I must have miscounted earlier when I thought there were more layers. It's easy to get confused with so many parentheses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication with a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. By breaking it down layer by layer, we find that each layer follows a specific formula, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**: Let a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The general solution for this recurrence is a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Determine Number of Layers**: There are 9 layers after the initial 3, so we compute a\u2089.\n\n5. **Compute a\u2089**: a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n6. **Final Calculation**: Multiply a\u2089 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " It's a bit of a long expression with a lot of parentheses and threes. Let me write it down to get a better look: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a mouthful. It looks like there are a bunch of nested expressions, each starting with 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can simplify this step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is 4. Now, I need to replace that part in the expression. Let me rewrite the expression, replacing the innermost parentheses with 4.\n\nSo, starting from the inside:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check that again. The innermost was the last (1 + 3), so replacing that gives me:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))\n\nWait, no, actually, each time I replace one, I have to make sure I'm moving outward correctly. Maybe it's better to approach this step by step, computing each layer one by one.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out. So, layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is the next one, and so on until layer 9, since I can see there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count how many times \"1 + 3\" appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I have (1 + 3(...)), so each step is adding another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, actually, maybe there are 9 layers. Let me try to see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), then moving outward each time. So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving outward, Layer 2 is: 3*(Layer1) + 1. Wait, no, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I should compute from the inside out, substituting each layer as I go.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write each step as I substitute each computed layer into the next one.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me see. The expression at Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer1)). So, yes, that's 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer3 would be 1 + 3*13, which is indeed 40.\n\nProceeding to Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...), where ... is the result of Layer9.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems like a big number, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each multiplication step.\n\nLet me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct each time. Now, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer9, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count how many times I applied the 1 + 3*() operation.\n\nStarting from the innermost, I had 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, Layer1 to Layer9, each time moving outward, and then the outermost 3*(Layer9).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = K.\n\nPlugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, which is n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier, but since I was computing step by step, it worked out.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by computing the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify the expression step by step without getting lost.\n\nSo, let me count how many sets of parentheses there are. Starting from the inside, each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new level. Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(result from step 1)\n3. Then another: 1 + 3(result from step 2)\n4.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- After the first 3, there's a \"(\", then \"1 + 3(\", so that's the first inner layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to just start from the innermost and work out. Let me try that.\n\nLet's number the layers from the innermost to the outermost.

Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(result from layer 1).\n\nSo, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1)\n\nWe already know layer1 is 4, so:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, layer2 = 13.\n\nNext, layer3: 1 + 3*(layer2)\n\nLayer2 is 13, so:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to layer4: 1 + 3*(layer3)\n\nLayer3 is 40, so:\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer4 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(layer4)\n\nLayer4 is 121, so:\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer5 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(layer5)\n\nLayer5 is 364, so:\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer6 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(layer6)\n\nLayer6 is 1093, so:\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer7 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(layer7)\n\nLayer7 is 3280, so:\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer8 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(layer8)\n\nLayer8 is 9841, so:\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(layer9), so:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to just multiply 29524 by 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7.\n\n9 *3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n3*4=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n3*2=6 +1=7.\n\n3*5=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n3*2=6 +1=7.\n\n3*9=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n3*2=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo,\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n500 *3=1500\n\n24 *3=72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.\n\nLet me go through the layers again quickly:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Each layer involves calculating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Use the result to compute the next layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3 * 4 = 13\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3 * 13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3 * 40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3 * 121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3 * 364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3 * 1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3 * 3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3 * 9841 = 29524\n4. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " It looks a bit complicated with all those nested parentheses, but I think I can handle it step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Let me try to break it down from the inside out because that's usually how you solve these kinds of problems. So, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outward.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost one is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers here because each time I see a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, and there are nine sets of that. Let me confirm by counting the number of opening parentheses before the first 1 + 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, nine layers. So I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, so that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses will be:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1)\n\nSo, substituting the result from Layer 1:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 3 times 13 is indeed 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCalculating that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, okay, 121. Let me confirm that 3*40 is 120, yes, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCalculating 3*121: 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 121*3 is 363? Let me check that. 120*3 is 360, plus 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Yes, that's correct. So 363 + 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCalculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWait, hold on, 364*3: Let me do it another way to confirm. 364 + 364 = 728, plus another 364 is 1092. Yes, that's correct. So 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, let me confirm that 1093*3 is indeed 3279. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Yes, correct. So 3279 + 1 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 3280*3: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So 9840 + 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. 9841*3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 29523 + 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, finally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result from Layer 9. So:\n\nFinal result = 3*(result from Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nCalculating that: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n________\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524*3 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just go through all the layers again quickly to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each layer's result is used correctly in the next one, and the multiplications and additions all check out.\n\nI think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of multiplications and additions. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost layer is reached.

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way out. So, let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that each set of parentheses starts with 1 + 3(...). So, maybe each layer is similar, and I can compute each one after another. Let me see how many layers there are. I count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1, and it seems like there are nine sets of parentheses. So, I'll need to compute nine layers, starting from the innermost one.\n\nLet me start from the very inside. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer (layer 9):\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down.\n\nLayer 8:\n1 + 3*(result from layer 9) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, so let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12, and then add 1. So:\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so layer 8 simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out to layer 7, which is 1 + 3*(result from layer 8). So:\n\nLayer 7:\n1 + 3*13\n\nAgain, compute 3*13 first, which is 39, then add 1:\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, layer 7 is 40.\n\nNext, layer 6 is 1 + 3*(result from layer 7):\n\nLayer 6:\n1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40 = 120, then add 1:\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 6 is 121.\n\nMoving on to layer 5:\n\nLayer 5:\n1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: Let's see, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then add 1:\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nNow, layer 4:\n\nLayer 4:\n1 + 3*364\n\nFirst, compute 3*364. Let me break this down: 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, adding those up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1:\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 4 is 1093.\n\nMoving to layer 3:\n\nLayer 3:\n1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1:\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 3 is 3280.\n\nNext, layer 2:\n\nLayer 2:\n1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280. Let's see, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1:\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 2 is 9841.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer, layer 1:\n\nLayer 1:\n3*(result from layer 2) = 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let's break this down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 29523.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

I guess the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses and move outwards. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll count how many sets of parentheses there are. Starting from the innermost, there's a 1+3, then each subsequent set adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me see, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n10.

So perhaps the expression is built up by each layer being 1 + 3 times the previous layer. That makes sense. So maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. So layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1), layer3 is 1+3*(layer2), and so on until layer9, which is the outermost. Then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). Wait, no, looking back, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)).

Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\nThe innermost part is 1+3, which is layer1.\n\nThen moving out, it's 1 + 3*(layer1) = layer2.\n\nThen layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2).\n\nAnd this continues until layer9, which is 1 + 3*(layer8).\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by layer9, which is 1 + 3*(layer8). Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nSo I think the way to approach this is to compute each layer from 1 to 9, starting with layer1 as 1+3, then layer2 as 1 + 3*layer1, and so on, up to layer9, and then multiply that by 3.\n\nLet me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So after computing layer9 as 29524, the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo then the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*20000 = 60000.\n\n3*9000 = 27000.\n\n3*500 = 1500.\n\n3*24 = 72.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined by layer_n = 1 + 3*layer_{n-1}, starting from layer1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence, and it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for layer_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nlayer_n = 1 + 3*layer_{n-1}, for n >= 2.\n\nWith layer1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is layer_n - 3*layer_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say layer_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\n=> C - 3C = 1\n\n=> -2C = 1\n\n=> C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is layer_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n = 1, layer1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is layer_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: layer_n = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2.\n\nWhich can be written as layer_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, layer9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, when I derived the general solution, I had layer_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nSo the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more because sometimes when I'm dealing with such large numbers, I might have missed a step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer step by step again to make sure.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break this down by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer is defined as \\( \\text{layer}_n = 1 + 3 \\times \\text{layer}_{n-1} \\) starting from the innermost layer.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times \\text{Layer 9} = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting overwhelmed.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(result from innermost)\n\nSo, substituting the innermost result:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so that simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another level, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's do that.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, okay, so now we have 40. Let me keep going. The next level up would again be 1 + 3*(current result).\n\nSo, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, that's a big jump. Let me double-check my calculations so far to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nOkay, that seems right so far. Let me continue.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*121\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nWhoa, that's a big number. Let me write that down.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*364\n\nHmm, 3*364 is... let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then add 1: 1093.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*1093\n\nLet me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then add 1: 3280.\n\nWait, so 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then add 1: 9841.\n\nSo, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841. Let me break that down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nAdding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nThen add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\nWait, so 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nNow, moving out another level: 1 + 3*29524\n\nCalculating 3*29524. Let's see, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nThen add 1: 88572 + 1 = 88573.\n\nSo, 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\n\nNow, the next level is 1 + 3*88573.\n\nCalculating 3*88573: Let me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 80000*3=240000\n\n8000*3=24000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n70*3=210\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding them up:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nThen add 1: 265719 + 1 = 265720.\n\nSo, 1 + 3*88573 = 265720.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3 times that result.\n\nSo, 3*265720.\n\nCalculating that: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n600000 + 180000 = 780000\n\n780000 + 15000 = 795000\n\n795000 + 2100 = 797100\n\n797100 + 60 = 797160.\n\nSo, 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 797,160.\n\nWait a second, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. 3*265720 = 797160\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each step builds upon the previous one, and the numbers are increasing exponentially, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a kind of geometric progression.\n\nWait, actually, this structure resembles a geometric series. Let me think about that for a moment. The expression is built as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). If I were to represent this recursively, maybe I could find a formula for it.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a base case and work my way up. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to a\u2089, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s and 1s to see how many terms there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each level adds a 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, actually, there are nine instances of (1 + 3(...)), starting from the innermost. So, the outermost is 3*(a\u2089), where a\u2089 is the ninth term.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s define a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a\u2081 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, after computing up to a\u2089, we have 3*a\u2089, right?\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nGiven that a\u2089 = 29524, then 3*a\u2089 = 88572.\n\nWait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier calculation where I ended up with 797160.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of terms. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new term. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, actually, when I count, starting from the innermost, each time I have a new (1 + 3(...)), so the number of a\u2099 terms is 9, but the outermost is 3*a\u2089.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 12 steps, which included the outermost multiplication by 3. So, maybe the confusion is arising from how I'm defining a\u2099.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of terms is 8, not 9. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 a\u2081 = 4\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another a\u2099:\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n\n...\n\nUp to a\u2089, which would be the 9th term, and then the outermost 3*a\u2089.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)\n\nThen each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) parts.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. 3*(layer 1) added to 1 \u2192 layer 2\n3. 3*(layer 2) added to 1 \u2192 layer 3\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer, which is 3*(layer 9) added to 1, but wait, actually, the outermost is just 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, hold on, let me parse the structure.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)), and this happens 8 more times, making a total of 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, so perhaps the number of a\u2099 terms is 9, with a\u2081 being the innermost, and a\u2089 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a\u2081 = 4, a\u2082 = 13, a\u2083 = 40, a\u2084 = 121, a\u2085 = 364, a\u2086 = 1093, a\u2087 = 3280, a\u2088 = 9841, a\u2089 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I ended up with 797,160. That suggests a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, so there are 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)), meaning that a\u2089 would be the innermost, and then we have 8 more layers, but actually, no, each layer is another (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm miscounting how many times the operation is applied.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me represent the entire expression as a series of nested functions.\n\nLet\u2019s define f(n) as follows:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1)\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2)\n\n...\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8)\n\nAnd the total expression is 3*f(9).\n\nSo, let's compute f(1) through f(9):\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I ended up with 797,160. That suggests that I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me go back to the original expression and count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(...)\n3. 3*(...)\n4. 3*(...)\n5. 3*(...)\n6. 3*(...)\n7. 3*(...)\n8. 3*(...)\n9. 3*(...)\n10. 3*(...)\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of 3*(...), but the outermost is just 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps the number of f(n) terms is 9, but the outermost is just 3*f(9). So, the total is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut when I did the step-by-step earlier, I ended up with 797,160, which is much larger. That suggests that I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted how many times I applied the 1 + 3* operation. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (layer 9)\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 (final result)\n\nWait, that's 9 layers of 1 + 3* and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, total layers inside the outermost 3*(...) are 9, each being 1 + 3*(...). So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I ended up with 797,160, which is 3*265,720, which suggests that I might have gone one layer too deep.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers as per the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer.\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, actually, starting from the innermost, each time we have a new (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is 9, but the outermost is just 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps the number of f(n) terms is 9, and then the outermost is 3*f(9).\n\nWait, but when I computed f(9) as 29524, then 3*f(9) is 88572, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 12 steps, ending with 797,160.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression differently.\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12; then 1 + Layer 2 = 13\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, perhaps the way to think about it is that each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the total expression is 3*(layer 9).\n\nSo, starting with layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4 = 1 + 3*layer3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5 = 1 + 3*layer4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6 = 1 + 3*layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*layer6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8 = 1 + 3*layer7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9 = 1 + 3*layer8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I ended up with 797,160. That suggests that I must have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because the original expression has nine 3s after the initial 3. Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(...)\n3. 3*(...)\n4. 3*(...)\n5. 3*(...)\n6. 3*(...)\n7. 3*(...)\n8. 3*(...)\n9. 3*(...)\n10. 3*(...)\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of 3*(...), but the outermost is just 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but the outermost is just 3*(...), so the total is 3*(layer9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut when I did the initial step-by-step, I went up to 3*265720 = 797160, which suggests that I might have gone one layer too deep.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, actually, it's 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)), starting from the innermost. So, the outermost is 3*(...), where ... is the 9th layer.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, I had 797,160, which is much larger. That suggests that I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to write the expression with each layer clearly defined.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 12; then 1 + Layer2 = 13\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps:\n\nLayer1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2 = 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3 = 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4 = 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5 = 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6 = 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7 = 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8 = 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9 = 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut why did I get 797,160 earlier? Let me check my step-by-step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so in my initial step-by-step, I stopped at step 10, which is 88,572, but earlier I thought I had 797,160. That suggests that I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers in the original expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)), meaning that the outermost is 3*(...), where ... is the 9th layer. Therefore, the total is 3*Layer9 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, my initial step-by-step was correct, and the final answer is 88,572, not 797,160.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had:\n\nAfter layer9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought I had 797,160, that was a miscalculation on my part. I must have miscounted the layers and continued one step too far.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by using a different approach. Maybe I can find a formula for this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven that each layer is defined as a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, we can write the homogeneous solution as a\u2099^h = C*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a\u2099^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1\n\n-2D = 1\n\nD = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying:\n\na\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's compute a\u2089:\n\na\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2\n\n3\u00b9\u2070 is 59049, so:\n\na\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier when I thought I had 797,160. It's clear now that the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Start from the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer)\n3. After 9 layers, we get a\u2089 = 29524\n4. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By systematically simplifying each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute innermost term**:\n   - Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Work outward layer by layer**:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7:"

    "text": " It's a bit of a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s, and I need to compute it step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. That seems straightforward. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4. Let me calculate that: 3 * 4 is 12. Okay, so now I can replace the innermost part with 12. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, the next layer out is (1 + 12). Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I'm replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with the result of that layer. So, starting from the very inside:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(result from step 1) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Then, the next layer is (1 + result from step 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Then, multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39\n5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121\n8. Multiply by 3: 3*121 = 363\n9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364\n10. Multiply by 3: 3*364 = 1092\n11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n12. Multiply by 3: 3*1093 = 3279\n13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n14. Multiply by 3: 3*3280 = 9840\n15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. Multiply by 3: 3*9841 = 29523\n17. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n18. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot of steps, and I might have made a mistake somewhere because the numbers are getting really big. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nStarting over, maybe I should number each step clearly. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13.\n4. Next: 3*13 = 39.\n5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40.\n6. Next: 3*40 = 120.\n7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121.\n8. Next: 3*121 = 363.\n9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364.\n10. Next: 3*364 = 1092.\n11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n12. Next: 3*1093 = 3279.\n13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n14. Next: 3*3280 = 9840.\n15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n16. Next: 3*9841 = 29523.\n17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n18. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, I got the same result both times. Maybe it's correct after all. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it step by step again, perhaps using a different approach, like expanding the expression or looking for a pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a pattern here. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a step. Let's say each step is of the form 3*(1 + previous step). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\na10 = 1 + 3*a9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, there are nine layers of 3*(...). Let me check the original expression again.\n\nWait, the problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s. Each 3 is multiplied by a parenthesis, and inside each parenthesis, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the first step, then each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nSo, let's count how many layers there are. Each time, we have a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis that starts with 1 + 3. So, from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + [3*(1 + 3)]\n4. 3*(1 + [3*(1 + 3)])\n5. 1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + 3)])]\n... and so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try to count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Each time, it's 3*(something). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then 3*(1 + 3), then 1 + 3*(result), etc. So, the number of multiplications by 3 is equal to the number of layers.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, we have a 3 followed by a parenthesis starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of 3s as multipliers. The first is the outermost 3, then each opening parenthesis after that has a 3 inside. Let me count how many times 3 is used as a multiplier.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, we have a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis that starts with 1 + 3. So, the number of times we have 3*(...) is equal to the number of layers.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, we have a 3 followed by a parenthesis. So, the first is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), etc.\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the first one. So, after the first 3, each time we have another 3 inside. So, the number of 3s as multipliers is equal to the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each time we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and there are 9 such layers.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have (1 + 3), then 3*(1 + 3), then 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s as multipliers.\n\nEach time, after the first 3, each parenthesis starts with 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of 3s as multipliers is equal to the number of layers, which is 9. Wait, no, perhaps it's 8, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, we have 3*(1 + 3), that's layer 2.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(result), that's layer 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we apply the operation 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we go out one layer, we apply 3*(1 + previous result). So, if there are n layers, we apply this operation n times.\n\nLooking at the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, we have a 3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\nAfter the first 3, each opening parenthesis starts with 3. So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have another 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, how many 3s are there as multipliers?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the initial one:\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, each parenthesis starts with 3. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n- The first 3 is the outermost one.\n- Then, each opening parenthesis after that starts with 3.\n\nSo, the number of 3s after the first one is 8, because each time we have a new 3*(...). So, total layers would be 9, including the first one.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 3 followed by an opening parenthesis, so the number of 3s as multipliers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a new 3 inside a parenthesis. Let me count how many times 3 is used as a multiplier:\n\n1. The first 3 is the outermost.\n2. Then, inside that, another 3.\n3. Then, another 3.\n4. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many times does 3 appear as a multiplier? Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n- The first 3 is the outermost.\n- Then, each parenthesis after that starts with a 3. So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, each opening parenthesis is preceded by a 3. Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 8 more 3s as multipliers, because each time we have 3(1 + 3(...)), and this happens 8 times before we reach the innermost (1 + 3). So, total layers would be 9, including the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the number of such layers is 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nBut regardless, when I computed earlier, I ended up with 88572 as the result. Let me check if that's correct by computing each step again.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*4 = 12\n3. Next: 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Next: 3*13 = 39\n5. Next: 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Next: 3*40 = 120\n7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121\n8. Next: 3*121 = 363\n9. Next: 1 + 363 = 364\n10. Next: 3*364 = 1092\n11. Next: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n12. Next: 3*1093 = 3279\n13. Next: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n14. Next: 3*3280 = 9840\n15. Next: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. Next: 3*9841 = 29523\n17. Next: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n18. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 18 steps, but perhaps I'm double-counting. Wait, no, each step is either adding 1 or multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one.\n\nLet me define a function f(n), where n is the number of layers, such that:\n\nf(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1))\n\nWith the base case f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, no, because f(1) would be the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15? Wait, that doesn't match my earlier steps. Hmm, perhaps I'm misdefining the function.\n\nWait, in my earlier computation, after (1 + 3) = 4, the next step was 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13, then 3*13 = 39, etc. So, perhaps the recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1).\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nLet me define f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nf(10) = 1 + 3*f(9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(f(9)), not f(10). So, the outermost operation is 3*(f(9)), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute this using another approach, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), whose solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant solution f_p(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4.\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have n = 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me confirm: f(1) corresponds to the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 13, which corresponds to the next layer.\n\nSo, f(9) would correspond to the 9th layer, which is just inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the outermost operation is 3*f(9).\n\nCompute f(9):\n\nf(9) = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To make sure, let me compute 3^10 just to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous result). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the result to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. Let me try to figure out how to approach it step by step.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses! I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer, maybe by numbering the parentheses or something. But since it's all 3s and 1s, I can just start evaluating from the inside.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the structure is 3(1 + 3(...)). So each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next layer).\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost expression and moving outward, replacing each innermost part with its value as I go.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3(1 + 3(...)), that's a layer. Let me count the number of times 3(1 + 3(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the problem: starting from the left, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, let's go step by step.\n\nLet me assign variables to each layer to make it easier. Maybe that will help me track each computation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since I think there are 9 layers here. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of 3(1 + 3(...) expressions. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that each time, the expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3(1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me try to parse it:\n\nThe entire expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, but actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)).\n\nSo perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the innermost and work my way out, computing each value step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me define Layer 1 as the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)).\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(inner layer)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, we can compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, we have 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the order. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nSo, each time, you have 3*(1 + 3*(inner expression)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(4)).\n\nWait, that would be 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but that seems too big. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer's value).\n\nWait, perhaps I should try computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot of layers. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the original problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first innermost part.\n\nThen each time we add another layer outward, so let's count the number of 3(1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\nLet me count: Starting from the left, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nHow many times does 3(1 + 3(...) occur? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is 9 levels deep.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each of those has their own (1 + 3(...)), until the innermost one is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another multiplication.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but that seems different from what I did earlier. So perhaps I was wrong before.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the layers. Let me try again.\n\nLet me think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outward, each time computing the value for each layer.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Let's call this Layer 2.\n\nThen, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Layer 3.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because earlier when I did it the other way, I got Layer 3 as 40, which is different. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the structure.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(inner expression)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nWait, but this seems to be growing very quickly, which might not be correct. Let me check if I'm interpreting the expression correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the expression in reverse, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, since there are 9 layers of 3(1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...) in the original problem.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, how many times does 3*(1 + 3*(...)) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which itself has 8 more layers, each with their own (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that the number of layers is 9, with each layer being 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)).\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 3*(1 + 3*E1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + 3*E2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + 3*E3) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + 3*E4) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + 3*E5) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339.\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + 3*E6) = 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + 3*E7) = 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + 3*E8) = 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, that seems really big, but perhaps that's correct. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nE3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct.\n\nE4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Correct.\n\nE5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704. Correct.\n\nE6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339. Correct.\n\nE7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. Correct.\n\nE8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. Correct.\n\nE9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n\nSo, according to this, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original problem has 9 layers of 3(1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, it's 9. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, so E1 to E9.\n\nWait, but when I did it the first time, I thought that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), but now I'm seeing that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by considering each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer), but actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nSo, in that case, the first layer is E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 3*(1 + 3*E1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + 3*E2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 354.\n\nAnd so on, up to E9 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the outermost expression 3*(1 + 3*(...)) or is it 3*(1 + 3*(...))?\n\nWait, the original problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So yes, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(inner layer)).\n\nTherefore, the computation as above is correct, leading to E9 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but that seems extremely large. Let me check with a smaller version to see if my approach is correct.\n\nLet me take a smaller version of the problem, say with only 2 layers.\n\nCompute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nCompute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, that's different.\n\nWait, wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Wait, so if I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), the innermost is 4, then 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39, then 3*(1 + 3*39) = 354.\n\nBut when I compute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous step-by-step which gave 354. So, clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the layers. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, the next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so in this case, the total is 120, not 354 as I thought earlier. So, my earlier approach was wrong.\n\nWait, so what's the correct way to compute this? It seems that I was confusing the layers by applying the 3* outside each time, but perhaps the structure is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each layer as 1 + 3*(next layer), and then the outermost is 3*(that layer).\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*E3 = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so in this case, with three layers (E1, E2, E3), the result is 120.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I was computing E2 as 3*(1 + 3*E1), which was incorrect because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), but each inner layer is 1 + 3*(innermost), not 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nLet me try again with the smaller example:\n\nCompute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, in this case, with three layers, the result is 120.\n\nWait, so in this case, each layer after the innermost is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the outermost is 3*(last layer).\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, which has 9 layers, the computation would be:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result. So, perhaps I was miscounting the layers before.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1).\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer):\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, in this case, the total number of layers is 9, with each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 4, and the final result is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I was considering each layer as 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), which led to a much larger number, but that seems to be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the layers are structured. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the outermost is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward, but this time, I'll write down each step clearly.\n\nStart with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, we have 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought of each layer as 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), I got a much larger number, but that must have been incorrect because when I tested it with a smaller example, that approach didn't work.\n\nTherefore, the correct way is to compute each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost, and then multiply the last layer by 3.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nLet me check once more with another smaller example to ensure my approach is correct.\n\nTake the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nWhich matches the earlier correct computation.\n\nAnother example: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this method to the original problem, the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outward.

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me write down each step as I go along.\n\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the inside, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps that with 1+3(...), and so on, until there are nine layers in total. So, I need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me list out each layer:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(result from layer 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from layer 2)\n...\n9. Outermost: 3*(result from layer 8)\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, let's compute each step.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out, so layer 1 is the innermost, layer 2 is the next one, up to layer 9, which is the outermost, but actually, the outermost is just 3*(layer 8). Wait, let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's see how many layers there are.\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: each 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...))\n- So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), and then the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1+3) is part of the next layer. So, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) terms.

Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3, each (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer. So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of 3*(...) terms.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3*(...)) is a new layer.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer))\n\nSo, let's count the number of layers:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1.

It looks like a recursive kind of expression where each part is similar but nested deeper each time. Let me try to break it down step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. That usually works best with these nested expressions.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is 1 + 3.

So, starting from L1 = 4, then L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the structure. Each layer is 3*(1 + next inner layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, let me list them step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this L1 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Let's call this L2 = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. L3 = 48.\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. L4 = 147.\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. L5 = 444.\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. L6 = 1335.\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. L7 = 4008.\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. L8 = 12027.\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. L9 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...). Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me think differently. Each time I have a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), so each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then, each outer layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is L1 = 4.\n\n- Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from L1, each layer is built on top of the previous one. So, how many layers do we have?\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times? Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nEach \"3(\" corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...:\n\n1. The first 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) is the outermost layer.\n\n2. Inside that, there's another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see: each time we have a 3*(1 + ...), so starting from the outermost, each layer is 3*(1 + inner layer). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + ...:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 inside is a new layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of 3*(1 + ...) is 9 times? Let me count:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nYes, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, we have 9 layers. Therefore, the computation goes as follows:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nThen, L2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let me compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So 300+120=420+24=444. Correct.\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let me compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct.\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct.\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let me compute 12028*3:\n\n12028 * 3:\n\nFirst, 10000*3=30000,\n\n2000*3=6000,\n\n20*3=60,\n\n8*3=24.\n\nAdding them up: 30000+6000=36000+60=36060+24=36084.\n\nSo, L9 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer, then each outer layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, with 9 layers, we end up with 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each step, to see if it matches.\n\nLooking at the sequence of results:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 15\n\nL3 = 48\n\nL4 = 147\n\nL5 = 444\n\nL6 = 1335\n\nL7 = 4008\n\nL8 = 12027\n\nL9 = 36084\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern or a recurrence relation here.\n\nEach term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 3.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Wait, but what's the initial condition? When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, plugging n=1 into the general solution:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 3/2 = (8/2 + 3/2) = 11/2.\n\nThus, C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = 11*(3^n)/6 = 11*(3^{n-1})*3/6 = 11*(3^{n-1})*(1/2) = (11/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, perhaps better to write it as:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nLet me compute L_n using this formula for n=9 to see if it matches 36084.\n\nCompute L_9:\n\nL_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nFirst, compute 3^9:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 3^9=19683.\n\nThen, (11/6)*19683 = (11 * 19683)/6.\n\nCompute 19683 / 6 first:\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5.\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nCompute 3280 * 11 = 36080.\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5.\n\nSo, total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 = 1.5.\n\nSo, L_9 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors in the step-by-step computation, I can cross-verify with the formula.\n\nSince n=9, L_9 = 36084, which matches both the step-by-step computation and the formula.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the previous layer's result).

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me try to break it down step by step. I'll start from the very inside:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n   1 + 3 = 4\n\n   So, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n   3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\n2. Next, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that.\n\n   First, compute 3 * 4 = 12.\n\n   Then, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n   So now, the expression is:\n\n   3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))))\n\n3. Moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3(13)).\n\n   Compute 3 * 13 = 39.\n\n   Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n   Updating the expression:\n\n   3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3(40)).\n\n   3 * 40 = 120.\n\n   1 + 120 = 121.\n\n   Now, the expression becomes:\n\n   3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))\n\n5. Next, (1 + 3(121)).\n\n   3 * 121 = 363.\n\n   1 + 363 = 364.\n\n   Updating:\n\n   3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))\n\n6. Now, (1 + 3(364)).\n\n   3 * 364 = 1092.\n\n   1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n   So, expression is:\n\n   3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))\n\n7. Next, (1 + 3(1093)).\n\n   3 * 1093 = 3279.\n\n   1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n   Updating:\n\n   3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)))\n\n8. Now, (1 + 3(3280)).\n\n   3 * 3280 = 9840.\n\n   1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n   Expression becomes:\n\n   3(1 + 3(9841))\n\n9. Next, (1 + 3(9841)).\n\n   3 * 9841 = 29523.\n\n   1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n   So, now we have:\n\n   3(1 + 29524)\n\n10. Now, (1 + 29524).\n\n    1 + 29524 = 29525.\n\n    So, the expression simplifies to:\n\n    3 * 29525.\n\n11. Finally, compute 3 * 29525.\n\n    Let me do that multiplication step by step.\n\n    29525 * 3:\n\n    5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n    2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n    5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n    9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n    2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\n    So, putting it all together, 29525 * 3 = 88575.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because I might have messed up the carrying.\n\nWait, actually, let me write it out properly:\n\n29525\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15.

Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88575. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 29525 \u00d7 3. Maybe using another method.\n\n29525 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 15 = 88575\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29525 = 88575.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88575.\n\nWait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3\u00d74) = 1 + 12 =13\n\n3. (1 + 3\u00d713)=1 +39=40\n\n4. (1 +3\u00d740)=1 +120=121\n\n5. (1 +3\u00d7121)=1 +363=364\n\n6. (1 +3\u00d7364)=1 +1092=1093\n\n7. (1 +3\u00d71093)=1 +3279=3280\n\n8. (1 +3\u00d73280)=1 +9840=9841\n\n9. (1 +3\u00d79841)=1 +29523=29524\n\n10. (1 +3\u00d729524)=1 +88572=88573\n\nWait, wait a second, hold on. In step 10, I think I messed up.\n\nWait, in step 9, I had 3\u00d79841=29523, so 1 +29523=29524, correct.\n\nThen step 10: (1 +3\u00d729524). Wait, no, actually, in the original expression, each step was (1 +3*(previous result)). So, after step 9, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(previous result)).\n\nWait, let me check my steps again because I think I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 +3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3)\n\nThen, each layer adds another (1 +3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses after each 1 +3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3)\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have another (1 +3(...)), so let's see:\n\nAfter the first (1 +3), we have 8 more layers because the expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1 +3(...)), each multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n\nWait, but when I was working through, I think I might have miscounted the layers, leading to an error in the final step.\n\nLet me try again, perhaps writing each step with the corresponding layer number to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me compute 3 \u00d729524:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n3 \u00d75=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n\n3\u00d79=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n\n3\u00d72=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nWait, so the total expression is 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 88575. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in my initial steps, I went up to step 10 as (1 +3\u00d729524)=88573, but that's incorrect because the expression is 3\u00d7(1 +3\u00d7...), which is 3\u00d7L9, which is 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nSo, perhaps I added an extra step where I shouldn't have.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nStarting from L1 to L9, each layer is (1 +3*previous), and the outermost is 3* L9.\n\nSo, L9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my first pass, I thought I ended up with 88575, but that must have been a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me verify each step again:\n\nL1: 1+3=4\n\nL2:1+3*4=13\n\nL3:1+3*13=40\n\nL4:1+3*40=121\n\nL5:1+3*121=364\n\nL6:1+3*364=1093\n\nL7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nL8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nL9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, so in my initial calculation, I went one step too far, thinking that the outermost expression was another (1 +3*...), but actually, the outermost is just 3 multiplied by L9.\n\nSo, that's where I went wrong earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another method, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nThis expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))) with n layers.\n\nIn this case, n=9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nI think this is a geometric series in disguise.\n\nLet me try to model it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*40=121\n\na_5=1 +3*121=364\n\na_6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to solve it as a non-homogeneous recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is:\n\na_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^n -1)/(c -1)\n\nWait, in this case, c=3, d=1.\n\nWait, but our initial condition is a_1=4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nB - 3*B =1\n\n-2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 88575, but that was a miscalculation. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think this method using the recurrence relation confirms the result.\n\nSo, to sum up, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3. Hmm, I think there are nine layers here because each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, and I can see nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, actually, let me recount. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n... and so on, until the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, actually, each time we add a layer, we're adding another 3(1 + ...). So maybe there are eight layers? Because the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me check:\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around with 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to visualize this as a series of nested expressions. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLayer 1: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nLayer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nAnd this continues until Layer 9, I think.

The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so let me count the number of 3*(...) parts:\n\nAfter the first 3*(...), there are 8 more 3*(...) expressions. So that makes 9 layers in total, right? Because each 3*(...) is a new layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds a 3*(...) around it. So actually, the number of layers is 9 because each 3*(...) is a new layer, including the first one.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index them from the inside out.\n\nLet me try to write each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, Layer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nLayer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nLayer 4: L4 = 1 + 3*L3\n\nLayer 5: L5 = 1 + 3*L4\n\nLayer 6: L6 = 1 + 3*L5\n\nLayer 7: L7 = 1 + 3*L6\n\nLayer 8: L8 = 1 + 3*L7\n\nLayer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). So the total expression is 3*(L9).\n\nSo, I think I need to compute L1 through L9, starting from L1 and moving outward.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3*524 = 1572\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nSo, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

The problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 3( starts a new layer, and each ) closes it. Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see that each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3(:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, 9 layers. That means I should compute 9 times, each time substituting the inner result into the outer expression.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I got to E9 = 364, and then 3*364 = 1092. But that seems too small. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the layers. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer2) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer3) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer5: (1 + Layer4) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer7: (1 + Layer6) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer9: (1 + Layer8) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but when I first did it, I went up to 29523, which was way higher. So perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. 3*(4) = 12.\n\n3. (1 + 12) = 13.\n\n4. 3*(13) = 39.\n\n5. (1 + 39) = 40.\n\n6. 3*(40) = 120.\n\n7. (1 + 120) = 121.\n\n8. 3*(121) = 363.\n\n9. (1 + 363) = 364.\n\n10. 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers? No, wait, the original problem has 9 layers, so maybe I'm counting one extra.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me think of it as a tree. Each 3(1 + ...) is a node with two children: 1 and another 3(...). So, the innermost node is (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer. Then each parent node is 3*(1 + child). So, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + Layer2)\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer3)\n\n...\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nWait, that might be the confusion. If the innermost is Layer9, then each layer above is the parent.\n\nSo, Layer9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer9) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer7: (1 + Layer8) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer7) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer5: (1 + Layer6) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer3: (1 + Layer4) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer3) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer1: (1 + Layer2) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer1) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but that's 9 layers, right? So, the final answer is 1092.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to compute step by step, I ended up with 29523, which is way larger. So I must have miscounted the layers earlier. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem has 8 layers, not 9. Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... parts.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2013 Layer 1\n\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) \u2013 Layer 2\n\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2013 Layer 3\n\n4. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2013 Layer 4\n\n5. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2013 Layer 5\n\n6. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2013 Layer 6\n\n7. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2013 Layer 7\n\n8. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2013 Layer 8\n\n9. 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2013 Layer 9\n\n10. 3(1 + 3)))) \u2013 Layer 10\n\nWait, that can't be right. The original expression ends with )))) after the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how deep it is.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Each time, it's a new layer.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write the expression with each layer labeled.\n\nLet me define E1 as the innermost expression:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 3*(E1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nE3 = 1 + E2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE4 = 3*E3 = 3*13 = 39.\n\nE5 = 1 + E4 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE6 = 3*E5 = 3*40 = 120.\n\nE7 = 1 + E6 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE8 = 3*E7 = 3*121 = 363.\n\nE9 = 1 + E8 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE10 = 3*E9 = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but that's 10 layers, but the original problem only has 9 layers. So I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm including the outermost 3*(...) as an additional layer, but in the original problem, the outermost is just 3*(...), so maybe it's 9 layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, let's consider that each \"3(\" is a new layer, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer, then each time we go out, it's a new layer.\n\nSo, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 12.\n\nLayer3: (1 + Layer2) = 13.\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3) = 39.\n\nLayer5: (1 + Layer4) = 40.\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 120.\n\nLayer7: (1 + Layer6) = 121.\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 363.\n\nLayer9: (1 + Layer8) = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, and the final result is 1092.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried to compute step by step, I ended up with 29523, which is way higher. So I must have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to write down each step clearly:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12.\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 12) = 13.\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39.\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 39) = 40.\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120.\n\n7. Next layer: (1 + 120) = 121.\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363.\n\n9. Next layer: (1 + 363) = 364.\n\n10. Next layer: 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nWait, but the original problem only has 9 layers, so why am I getting 10 layers here? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3(1 + 3(...) parts:\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + ...), so let's count:\n\n1. The first 3*(1 + 3*(...)) is layer 1.\n\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)) is layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does 3*(1 + 3*(...)) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\" in the expression:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + ...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + ...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + ...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(1 + ...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(1 + ...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(1 + ...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(1 + ...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(1 + ...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, layer 8: 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer6: 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer2: 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, so the final result is 1092.\n\nBut earlier, I thought I had 16 layers and got 29523, which was clearly wrong. So I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1092.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. 3*4 = 12.\n\n3. 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n4. 3*13 = 39.\n\n5. 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n6. 3*40 = 120.\n\n7. 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n8. 3*121 = 363.\n\n9. 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n10. 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but that's 10 steps, but only 9 layers. So, perhaps the confusion is that each layer alternates between 3* and 1 +.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 12) = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 39) = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 120) = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 363) = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*364 = 1092.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 1092.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers, leading to an incorrect result. But now, carefully stepping through each layer, I arrive at 1092.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with 9 layers. Starting from the innermost part and working outward, each layer alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{1092}$"

Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually works with nested expressions. So, let me write it out as I understand it:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, so starting from the inside, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Then each layer wraps that with another 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me try to parse this correctly.\n\nLet me count how many times the 3 is multiplied. It looks like there are nine layers of 3(1 + ...). Let me verify:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n...\n9. 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\nAnd then finally, multiply the whole thing by 3.\n\nWait, actually, the outermost is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...). So maybe I should consider the innermost as step 1, and then each layer adds another 3*(...) until the outermost.\n\nLet me try to write this step by step.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, S3, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost, and S9 is the outermost.\n\nSo:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2\n\n...\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8\n\nThen the total expression is 3*S9.\n\nSo I can compute S1 to S9 step by step.\n\nLet me compute each step one by one.\n\nStarting with S1:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. S2 is 13.\n\nNow S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 40. That's S3.\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nOkay, 121. S4 is 121.\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n364. That's S5.\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWow, 1093. That's a big number. S6 is 1093.\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3280. S7 is 3280.\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9841. That's S8.\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo S9 is 29524.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo reading from top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n= ?\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nSo the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computations step by step because these numbers are getting large quickly.\n\nLet me recompute S1 to S9:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each step, but since there are only nine layers, step-by-step computation might be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each step is a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think: Each S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me write the recurrence: S(n) = 3*S(n-1) + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is S_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution S_p(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is S(n) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition S(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the solution is S(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, S(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo for n=9, S(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo S(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. Good.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*S(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*S(9) = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSame result.\n\nSo whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way out.

Let me try to break this down step by step. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually makes these kinds of problems manageable.\n\nSo, first, I'll rewrite the expression to see it more clearly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of nested expressions, I see there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with a 1 + 3(...). So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows to keep track:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, and then multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of 3s or the number of parentheses.\n\nLooking at the original expression, after the initial 3, there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so I think there are nine layers. So, I need to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing Layer 1, which is the innermost part:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121: Let's compute that. 120*3 = 360, and 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let's break this down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let me compute this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that because 29524*3 might be better computed as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, writing it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial breakdown. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the first method.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 *3=6 +1=7.\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2 *3=6 +1=7.\n9 *3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 *3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 *3=6 +1=7.\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, so 29524 *3 is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial breakdown, I thought 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, which adds up to 87000, then 500*3=1500, which brings it to 88500, 20*3=60 to 88560, and 4*3=12 to 88572. So, both methods give the same result. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again:\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\n3*9841: Let me compute 9841 *3.\n\n9841*3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut wait, there's no digit beyond 9 in 9841, so the carryover 2 would make it 29, so the result is 29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is there another way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually? Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me define L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 +3.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 =1 +3*L_1 =1 +3*4=13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3=1 +3*L_2=1 +3*13=40.\n\nSo, in general, L_{n} =1 +3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n -3L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1.\n\nSolving for A: A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3C -1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2=3C => 9/2=3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nWait, but wait, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is L_1=4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9.\n\nSo, using the formula, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, I could have directly computed L_9 as (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nThis method is much faster and avoids computing each layer step by step, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I only had nine layers, both methods worked, but the formula is more efficient.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, I could solve it using the formula for the nth term, which gave me the result more quickly.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nwe start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each part is similar, so maybe there's a pattern or a way to simplify it by working from the inside out. I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, you should start solving from the innermost one and work your way outwards. That makes sense because each expression inside the parentheses depends on the result of the inner expression.\n\nLet me try to break it down. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big parentheses. Inside that parentheses, there's a 1 plus 3 times another parentheses, and this pattern repeats multiple times. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part, I see:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, moving outwards, each time it's 1 + 3*(something). Let me count how many layers there are.

Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me try a different approach. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer.

Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each time I go out, I add another layer. Let me count the number of times I have \"1 + 3(\" before the innermost. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and each layer outwards increases by one. So, the total number of layers is 9. So, we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(something). That means I need to compute each layer starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me say that a\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081. Then, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, if I define a\u2081 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then a\u2082 is 1 + 3*a\u2081, a\u2083 is 1 + 3*a\u2082, etc., up to a\u2089, and then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I need to compute a\u2081 through a\u2089, where each a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting with a\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nLet me compute each a\u2099 step by step.\n\nFirst, a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, hold on, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, a\u2086 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, a\u2087 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, a\u2088 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, a\u2089 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nLet me recompute a\u2089:\n\na\u2081 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7        3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that.\n\nEach a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a\u2099 = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let me recall the standard solution method for linear recurrences of the form a\u2099 = c*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + d.\n\nIn this case, c=3 and d=1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a\u2099^h = A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can try a constant solution a\u2099^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a\u2081 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a\u2089, n=9.\n\na\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula without computing each term step by step. Let me think.\n\nGiven that each a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, and a\u2081 = 4.\n\nSo, expanding the first few terms:\n\na\u2081 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 12 = 16? Wait, no, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think recursively.\n\nEach a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, so if I unroll the recursion, a\u2099 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2082) = 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2*a\u2099\u208b\u2082.\n\nContinuing this, a\u2099 = 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2 + 3\u00b3*a\u2099\u208b\u2083.\n\nIf I keep unrolling, eventually, I'll get a\u2099 = 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*a\u2081.\n\nSince a\u2081 = 4, this would give a\u2099 = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n}*4.\n\nWait, but earlier we found that a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf I unroll the recursion, a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081\n\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2082)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2*a\u2099\u208b\u2082\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2*(1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2083)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2 + 3\u00b3*a\u2099\u208b\u2083\n\nContinuing this, we get a geometric series:\n\na\u2099 = 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*a\u2081\n\nBut since a\u2081 = 4, which is 1 + 3, so a\u2081 = 4.\n\nWait, but if I plug in n=1, a\u2081 = 4, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, if I have a\u2099 = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^{k} + 3^{n}*a\u2081\n\nBut a\u2081 is 4, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the general formula we found earlier, which is a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that seems more straightforward.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result without computing each term step by step, which is helpful.\n\nBut, since I already computed each term step by step and got the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing a few terms again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I break down 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step, so I don't see any mistakes. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with the formula helped ensure the correctness.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me write it down to make it clearer:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. Hmm, I think I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many parentheses there are. Starting from the inside, each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nWait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... 9 times? Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression starts with 3(1 + 3(... and each subsequent 3 is multiplied by another (1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) parts. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, right? So that's layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outwards, the next layer is 1 + 3*(layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on until we reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, so how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count how many times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me look:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each time we have (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of these.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each time we have a 1 + 3 multiplied by the next layer. Let me try to write this step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, after computing L9, which is 29524, we multiply by 3.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step because it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 360*3=1080, 4*3=12, so 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So 29524*3. Let's compute that.\n\n29524*3:\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdd 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000=79048\n\n79048 + 9000=88048\n\n88048 + 500=88548\n\n88548 + 24=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed a layer. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is L1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many 3*(...) terms?\n\nLet me see: Each time we have a 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of times we have that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until we reach the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each layer corresponds to one more 3*(...) term. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer? Wait, no, let me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) terms.\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach time we add another layer. Let's see how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each time we have a 3*(1 + ...) which itself contains another 3*(1 + ...), and so on. So, the number of layers is 9, as there are 9 sets of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the 9th layer? Or is it the 8th?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 1 + 3(...) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3)) \u2192 2 layers\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) \u2192 3 layers\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is 9, because each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each 1 + 3*(...) is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So in total, how many layers?\n\nLooking at the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))\n7. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n8. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n9.

Let me write it down to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses! It looks like each part is similar, just repeating with 3s and 1s. Maybe I can solve it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to break it down. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, I have 3 times that result. So the next part is 3(1 + 3(...)). But wait, actually, let me see how it's structured.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIt's like each 3 is multiplied by a sum that includes another similar expression. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something).\n\nLet me try to write each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12\n3. Next: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Then: 3 * 13 = 39\n5. Next: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Then: 3 * 40 = 120\n7. Next: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Then: 3 * 121 = 363\n9. Next: (1 + 363) = 364\n10. Then: 3 * 364 = 1092\n11. Next: (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. Then: 3 * 1093 = 3279\n13. Next: (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. Then: 3 * 3280 = 9840\n15. Next: (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. Then: 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\nWait, let me check how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I move out, I'm handling another layer. Let me count the number of 3s multiplied. Hmm, the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 3(...). So, perhaps I should have 9 layers? Wait, let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first multiplication. Then each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, how many multiplications by 3 are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The innermost is 3 inside the first (1 + 3).\n2. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost to outermost, each step adds another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15? Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should process each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me number the layers from 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and layer 9 is the outermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Wait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of each layer as 3*(1 + next layer). Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent each step as starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nLet me start from the innermost expression and work my way outward, computing each step.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3):\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + result from Step 1). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\n3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me try that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step is 3*(1 + previous step). So, let's try that.\n\nLet me define each step as S1, S2, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3 = 3*(1 + S2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4 = 3*(1 + S3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5 = 3*(1 + S4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6 = 3*(1 + S5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7 = 3*(1 + S6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8 = 3*(1 + S7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9 = 3*(1 + S8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers, right? Let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, I think I did 9 steps, from S1 to S9. So, S9 should be the final result, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again because I might have made an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me redo each step carefully:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3: 3*(1 + S2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4: 3*(1 + S3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5: 3*(1 + S4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6: 3*(1 + S5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7: 3*(1 + S6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8: 3*(1 + S7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9: 3*(1 + S8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of 3s in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the outermost 3, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost, there are 9 instances of 3*(...). So, 9 layers, which means 9 steps, which is what I did. So, S9 is the final result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe using a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nThis kind of expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see.\n\nEach step is 3*(1 + previous step). So, if I let a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, a_1 was 4, a_2 was 15, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a pattern.\n\nCompute the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15\n\na_3 = 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48\n\na_4 = 3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147\n\na_5 = 3 + 3*147 = 3 + 441 = 444\n\na_6 = 3 + 3*444 = 3 + 1332 = 1335\n\na_7 = 3 + 3*1335 = 3 + 4005 = 4008\n\na_8 = 3 + 3*4008 = 3 + 12024 = 12027\n\na_9 = 3 + 3*12027 = 3 + 36081 = 36084\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculations. So, a_9 is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence can be expressed as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*(1 + C)\n\nC = 3 + 3C\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\n3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nA = (11/2) / 3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6\n\nBut 3^{n} / 6 can be written as 3^{n-1} / 2\n\nWait, let me compute for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\n3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36,080 and 0.5 *11=5.5, so total 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches our earlier result of 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it using two methods: step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, both leading to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll count how many layers there are. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and it seems like there are nine such layers because I see nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost one, which is the last one: 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each time, inside the parentheses, it's 1 + 3*(next inner expression). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer out is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so Layer 2 gives me 13. Now, moving out to Layer 3, which would be 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2). So:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, Layer 3 is 40. Let's go to Layer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, moving on to Layer 6:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nNow, Layer 7:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Okay, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nMoving to Layer 8:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.

So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3 times that entire Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that.\n\nSo, the final step is:\n\nTotal expression: 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, but that's breaking it down too much. Alternatively, just compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that gives 88572? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7.\n\n5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to see if there's a pattern here.\n\nEach layer seems to follow the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nwith a_1 = 4\n\nSo, starting from a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I know that this kind of recurrence can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2*C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in our case, a_1 is 4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, I can compute 3*29524 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{result from the inner layer})\\). By computing each layer step by step and applying the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{inner expression})\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute from the Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   The entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of parentheses. I think I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me write it down more clearly so I can see each layer.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). Let me see how many layers there are. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by working from the innermost to the outermost step by step. Let me number each layer to keep track.\n\nLet's define each step as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outwards, each step involves computing (1 + 3*(previous result)). So let's see:\n\nWait, but looking at the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So each step is 1 + 3*(result of the next inner expression). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo L2 is 13.\n\nNext layer, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: that's 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo L3 is 40.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I might be missing a layer. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...). So the innermost is (1+3), then each next layer is 1+3*(previous layer's result). So let me list each layer properly.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(...)) where the ... is another similar expression. Let me count how many times 1+3 occurs.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, 1+3*(1+3)\n3. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. And so on, until we have 9 layers, since the problem has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3 starts a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3...:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), so that's 1 layer.\n2. Then, the next layer is (1+3*(1+3)), which is 2 layers.\n3. Then, (1+3*(1+3*(1+3))) is 3 layers.\n4. Continuing this way, up to 9 layers because there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, but actually, in the expression, each (1+3 is followed by another (1+3, so the number of layers is 9. Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1+3*(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1+3*(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1+3*(Layer3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1+3*(Layer4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1+3*(Layer5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1+3*(Layer6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1+3*(Layer7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1+3*(Layer8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check: the problem is 3*(1+3*(...)), so the first 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression, which is 9 layers deep.\n\nSo, after computing Layer9 as 29524, then the final result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*     3\n--------\n88,572\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that each layer is correct because I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting big quickly, and I might have missed a layer or miscounted. Let me count the number of layers again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each (1+3 is a new layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3...:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3) \u2192 Layer1\n2. Next, (1+3*(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer2\n3. Then, (1+3*(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer3\n4. Then, (1+3*(Layer3)) \u2192 Layer4\n5. Then, (1+3*(Layer4)) \u2192 Layer5\n6. Then, (1+3*(Layer5)) \u2192 Layer6\n7. Then, (1+3*(Layer6)) \u2192 Layer7\n8. Then, (1+3*(Layer7)) \u2192 Layer8\n9. Then, (1+3*(Layer8)) \u2192 Layer9\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, Layer9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if each multiplication by 3 is correct.\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since it's only 9 layers, it's manageable manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can observe that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven L1 = 4.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo,\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo,\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen,\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\nL1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo,\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer9, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 =27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) =3*29524=88,572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the step-by-step computation gives 88,572 as the final result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each layer step by step without getting confused.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3(4). Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 4 = 12.\n\nGreat, so now that part simplifies to 12. The next layer out is (1 + 12). Let me do that:\n\n1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNow, moving outward again, we have 3 times 13:\n\n3 * 13 = 39.\n\nHmm, so now that part becomes 39. The next layer is (1 + 39):\n\n1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 3 times 40:\n\n3 * 40 = 120.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 120):\n\n1 + 120 = 121.\n\nThen, 3 times 121:\n\n3 * 121 = 363.\n\nMoving outward, (1 + 363):\n\n1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, 3 times 364:\n\n3 * 364. Let me compute that. 3 * 300 is 900, 3 * 60 is 180, 3 * 4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nSo, that part simplifies to 1092. The next layer is (1 + 1092):\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nThen, 3 times 1093. Let me calculate that. 3 * 1000 is 3000, 3 * 90 is 270, 3 * 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nSo, that becomes 3279. The next layer is (1 + 3279):\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nThen, 3 times 3280. Let me compute that. 3 * 3000 is 9000, 3 * 200 is 600, 3 * 80 is 240. So, adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nSo, that simplifies to 9840. The next layer is (1 + 9840):\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThen, 3 times 9841. Let me calculate that. 3 * 9000 is 27000, 3 * 800 is 2400, 3 * 40 is 120, and 3 * 1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nSo, that becomes 29523. The next layer is (1 + 29523):\n\n1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 times 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 20000 is 60000, 3 * 9000 is 27000, 3 * 500 is 1500, 3 * 20 is 60, and 3 * 4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nSo, that simplifies to 88572. The next layer is (1 + 88572):\n\n1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nThen, 3 times 88573. Let me calculate that. 3 * 80000 is 240000, 3 * 8000 is 24000, 3 * 500 is 1500, 3 * 70 is 210, and 3 * 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719.\n\nSo, that becomes 265719. The next layer is (1 + 265719):\n\n1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nThen, 3 times 265720. Let me compute that. 3 * 200000 is 600000, 3 * 60000 is 180000, 3 * 5000 is 15000, 3 * 700 is 2100, 3 * 20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160.\n\nSo, that simplifies to 797160. The next layer is (1 + 797160):\n\n1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nThen, 3 times 797161. Let me calculate that. 3 * 700000 is 2100000, 3 * 90000 is 270000, 3 * 7000 is 21000, 3 * 100 is 300, 3 * 60 is 180, and 3 * 1 is 3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483.\n\nSo, that becomes 2391483. The next layer is (1 + 2391483):\n\n1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\nThen, 3 times 2391484. Let me compute that. 3 * 2000000 is 6000000, 3 * 300000 is 900000, 3 * 90000 is 270000, 3 * 1000 is 3000, 3 * 400 is 1200, 3 * 80 is 240, and 3 * 4 is 12. Adding those together: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, plus 270000 is 7170000, plus 3000 is 7173000, plus 1200 is 7174200, plus 240 is 7174440, plus 12 is 7174452.\n\nSo, that simplifies to 7174452. The next layer is (1 + 7174452):\n\n1 + 7174452 = 7174453.\n\nThen, 3 times 7174453. Let me calculate that. 3 * 7000000 is 21000000, 3 * 100000 is 300000, 3 * 70000 is 210000, 3 * 4000 is 12000, 3 * 400 is 1200, 3 * 50 is 150, and 3 * 3 is 9. Adding those together: 21000000 + 300000 = 21300000, plus 210000 is 21510000, plus 12000 is 21522000, plus 1200 is 21523200, plus 150 is 21523350, plus 9 is 21523359.\n\nSo, that becomes 21523359. The next layer is (1 + 21523359):\n\n1 + 21523359 = 21523360.\n\nThen, 3 times 21523360. Let me compute that. 3 * 20000000 is 60000000, 3 * 1000000 is 3000000, 3 * 500000 is 1500000, 3 * 20000 is 60000, 3 * 3000 is 9000, 3 * 300 is 900, 3 * 60 is 180, and 3 * 0 is 0. Adding those together: 60000000 + 3000000 = 63000000, plus 1500000 is 64500000, plus 60000 is 64560000, plus 9000 is 64569000, plus 900 is 64570900, plus 180 is 64571080, plus 0 is 64571080.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check my calculations again because 3 times 21,523,360 should be:\n\n21,523,360 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000,000 * 3 = 60,000,000\n\n1,523,360 * 3: Let's break that down.\n\n1,000,000 * 3 = 3,000,000\n\n523,360 * 3: 500,000 * 3 = 1,500,000; 23,360 * 3 = 70,080\n\nSo, adding those together:\n\n3,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 4,500,000 + 70,080 = 4,570,080\n\nNow, adding that to the 60,000,000:\n\n60,000,000 + 4,570,080 = 64,570,080\n\nSo, 3 * 21,523,360 = 64,570,080. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the next layer is (1 + 64,570,080):\n\n1 + 64,570,080 = 64,570,081.\n\nThen, 3 times 64,570,081. Let me compute that. 3 * 60,000,000 is 180,000,000; 3 * 4,000,000 is 12,000,000; 3 * 500,000 is 1,500,000; 3 * 70,000 is 210,000; 3 * 80 is 240; 3 * 1 is 3.\n\nAdding those together:\n\n180,000,000 + 12,000,000 = 192,000,000\n\n192,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 193,500,000\n\n193,500,000 + 210,000 = 193,710,000\n\n193,710,000 + 240 = 193,710,240\n\n193,710,240 + 3 = 193,710,243.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 3 times 64,570,081 should be 193,710,243. Let me verify:\n\n64,570,081 * 3:\n\n60,000,000 * 3 = 180,000,000\n\n4,000,000 * 3 = 12,000,000\n\n500,000 * 3 = 1,500,000\n\n70,000 * 3 = 210,000\n\n80 * 3 = 240\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n180,000,000 + 12,000,000 = 192,000,000\n\n192,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 193,500,000\n\n193,500,000 + 210,000 = 193,710,000\n\n193,710,000 + 240 = 193,710,240\n\n193,710,240 + 3 = 193,710,243.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 64,570,081 = 193,710,243.\n\nNow, the next layer is (1 + 193,710,243):\n\n1 + 193,710,243 = 193,710,244.\n\nThen, 3 times 193,710,244. Let me compute that. 3 * 100,000,000 is 300,000,000; 3 * 90,000,000 is 270,000,000; 3 * 3,000,000 is 9,000,000; 3 * 700,000 is 2,100,000; 3 * 10,000 is 30,000; 3 * 200 is 600; 3 * 40 is 120; 3 * 4 is 12.\n\nWait, actually, let me do it step by step:\n\n193,710,244 * 3:\n\n100,000,000 * 3 = 300,000,000\n\n90,000,000 * 3 = 270,000,000\n\n3,000,000 * 3 = 9,000,000\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n10,000 * 3 = 30,000\n\n200 * 3 = 600\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n300,000,000 + 270,000,000 = 570,000,000\n\n570,000,000 + 9,000,000 = 579,000,000\n\n579,000,000 + 2,100,000 = 581,100,000\n\n581,100,000 + 30,000 = 581,130,000\n\n581,130,000 + 600 = 581,130,600\n\n581,130,600 + 120 = 581,130,720\n\n581,130,720 + 12 = 581,130,732.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 193,710,244 * 3 should be 581,130,732? Let me check:\n\n193,710,244 * 3:\n\nFirst, 100,000,000 * 3 = 300,000,000\n\n90,000,000 * 3 = 270,000,000\n\n3,000,000 * 3 = 9,000,000\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n10,000 * 3 = 30,000\n\n200 * 3 = 600\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them:\n\n300,000,000 + 270,000,000 = 570,000,000\n\n570,000,000 + 9,000,000 = 579,000,000\n\n579,000,000 + 2,100,000 = 581,100,000\n\n581,100,000 + 30,000 = 581,130,000\n\n581,130,000 + 600 = 581,130,600\n\n581,130,600 + 120 = 581,130,720\n\n581,130,720 + 12 = 581,130,732.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 193,710,244 = 581,130,732.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression only has nine layers of parentheses. Let me count how many times I've done this.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n2. 3*4=12\n3. (1+12)=13\n4. 3*13=39\n5. (1+39)=40\n6. 3*40=120\n7. (1+120)=121\n8. 3*121=363\n9. (1+363)=364\n10. 3*364=1092\n11. (1+1092)=1093\n12. 3*1093=3279\n13.

(1+64571080)=64571081\n32. 3*64571081=193713243\n33. (1+193713243)=193713244\n34. 3*193713244=581139732\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(result)\n3. (1 + result)\n4. 3*(result)\n5. (1 + result)\n6. 3*(result)\n7. (1 + result)\n8. 3*(result)\n9. (1 + result)\n10. 3*(result)\n11. (1 + result)\n12. 3*(result)\n13. (1 + result)\n14. 3*(result)\n15.

(1 + result)\n26. 3*(result)\n27. (1 + result)\n28. 3*(result)\n29. (1 + result)\n30. 3*(result)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each \"3(...)\" is a layer. So, how many \"3(...)\" are there?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(...))\n- The next is 3(1 + 3(...))\n- And so on.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first innermost. Then, each time we go out, we have a 3*(...). Let's count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(result)\n3. (1 + result)\n4. 3*(result)\n5. (1 + result)\n6. 3*(result)\n7. (1 + result)\n8. 3*(result)\n9. (1 + result)\n10. 3*(result)\n11. (1 + result)\n12. 3*(result)\n13. (1 + result)\n14. 3*(result)\n15. (1 + result)\n16. 3*(result)\n17.

(1 + result)\n28. 3*(result)\n29. (1 + result)\n30. 3*(result)\n\nWait, that seems too many. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent 3( is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 3( in the expression:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 3(...). Therefore, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )) nine times.\n\nWait, so that means the innermost is (1 + 3), then 3*(innermost), then (1 + that result), and so on, for a total of 9 layers of 3*(...). So, in total, we have 9 layers.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I went through 34 steps, which suggests that I might have miscounted the layers. Let me try again, this time keeping track of the number of layers.\n\nLet me list the layers step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3 * 4 = 12\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n4. 3 * 13 = 39\n5.

I think I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify: Each time I have a (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then, moving out, each \"3*(...)\" is another layer.\n\nBut in the original expression, it's:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" expressions. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(result)\n3. (1 + result)\n4. 3*(result)\n5. (1 + result)\n6. 3*(result)\n7. (1 + result)\n8. 3*(result)\n9. (1 + result)\n10. 3*(result)\n11. (1 + result)\n12. 3*(result)\n13. (1 + result)\n14. 3*(result)\n15. (1 + result)\n16. 3*(result)\n17. (1 + result)\n18. 3*(result)\n19. (1 + result)\n20. 3*(result)\n21. (1 + result)\n22. 3*(result)\n23. (1 + result)\n24. 3*(result)\n25. (1 + result)\n26. 3*(result)\n27. (1 + result)\n28. 3*(result)\n29. (1 + result)\n30. 3*(result)\n\nWait, that can't be. There must be a mistake here. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, each layer adds a 3*(...). Let's count the number of 3*(...) layers.\n\nEach \"3(\" after the initial one adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" in the expression:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 3*(...). Therefore, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )) nine times.\n\nTherefore, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3 * 4 = 12\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n4. 3 * 13 = 39\n5. (1 + 39) = 40\n6. 3 * 40 = 120\n7. (1 + 120) = 121\n8. 3 * 121 = 363\n9. (1 + 363) = 364\n10. 3 * 364 = 10"

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let's take a deep breath and tackle this. It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, so I'll need to work from the innermost parentheses outward. That's usually the way to handle such expressions.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3 multiplied by the previous result.\n\nLet me try to write this out step by step. I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the inside out for clarity:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. Next: (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but looking at the problem, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous expression. So, each step involves multiplying the result of the inner expression by 3 and then adding 1.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3)\nThat's easy: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nStep 2: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 1))\nSo, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out:\n\nStep 3: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 2))\nSo, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nMoving outward again:\n\nStep 4: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 3))\nThat's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\nStep 5: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 4))\nSo, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer:\n\nStep 6: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 5))\nThat's 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nMoving outward:\n\nStep 7: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 6))\nSo, 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer:\n\nStep 8: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 7))\nThat's 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\nStep 9: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 8))\nSo, 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost layer:\n\nStep 10: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 9))\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, in the original problem, after the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). But let me check how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...), so the number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, each step is a layer, and the total number of layers is 9. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting with the innermost (1+3), then each next layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times we have 1+3(...). From the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a nested expression.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...), and there are 9 such layers, right? Because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...).\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had 9 layers, each giving a result up to 29524, which would be the result of the 9th layer. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that result, right?\n\nWait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the first (1 + 3*(...)), which is the outermost layer. So, after computing the 9th layer, which is (1 + 3*(result from 8th layer)), which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, so perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the 9th layer's result is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but when I was computing earlier, I had 9 layers, each giving a result up to 29524, which would be the result of the 9th layer. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the first layer after 3 is the 9th layer, which is 29524, and then 3*29524 would be the final result.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot, but let me compute it step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, but let's see: If each layer is (1 + 3*previous), starting from 4, then:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n---------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 *3 can be computed as:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) *3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount how many layers you have.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a nested expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3 starts a new layer. Let me count how many times (1+3 appears.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we have a 3 multiplied by a nested expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series or something else, but given that each step is straightforward, maybe it's better to just recount the layers.\n\nWait, let me write down the expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each layer is (1 + 3*previous result).\n\nSo, layer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times layer 9, so 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nEach (1+3(....)) is a layer. Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, the next layer is (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each (1+3) is nested 9 times. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each (1+3 is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach (1+3 starts a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times (1+3 appears as a new term.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3, each subsequent (1+3 is nested within the previous one.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9 because each time we have another (1+3.\n\nWait, but let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, we have:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 40\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9.\n\nLooking at the expression, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of times (1+3 appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have (1+3, so:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8 because after the initial 3, each (1+3 adds a new layer, so total layers after the initial 3 is 9, making the total layers 10? Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me consider that each layer is a multiplication by 3 and then adding 1. So, the expression can be represented as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, because the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we reach a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of times (1+3 appears as a new term in the expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3 terms:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Each time we add another (1+3, so starting from the innermost as 1, then each layer adds another, so the outermost layer is the 9th one.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think that the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied, which would be 9 times, leading to a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make absolutely sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the expression as a sum.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)... )))\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, the value after n layers can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me just compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24\n\nSo,\n\n20,000 *3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 *3 = 27,000\n\n500 *3 = 1,500\n\n24 *3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've double-checked each step, and the computations seem accurate.

    "text": " It's this long expression with a bunch of nested parentheses and threes. Let me write it down so I can see it clearly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me see how many layers there are here.\n\nLooking at it, I can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2014 okay, so there are nine sets of parentheses. So, I'll need to compute starting from the innermost one and keep expanding each layer step by step.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing the innermost parentheses with 4, the expression now becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check that. The innermost was the last (1 + 3), so when I replace that with 4, it affects the next layer up. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next one would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me write each step as I go:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 1)).\n\nSo, step 2: Compute 1 + 3*4.\n\n3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*13)))))))\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me make sure I'm replacing the correct parentheses each time.\n\nActually, maybe a better approach is to label each layer from the inside out. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we compute that:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n24 * 3 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStart from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, that gave me 60000 + 27000 = 87000, then +1500 = 88500, then +72 = 88572. So that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't skip or miscalculate any.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to verify.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from the inside.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants.\n\nWe can find B by setting the homogeneous solution aside.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSo, C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nEach layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step as I did before, and it still gives the same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost outwards:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 after adding 1 and some inner expression. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3(1 + ... ), that's a layer.

Then another layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And this continues until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the expression, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers, I think. Let me check:\n\nThe innermost part is 1+3, then each time you have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\n1. Let me denote each step as S1, S2, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, S2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2\n\nAnd so on, up to S9.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each step is multiplied by 3 after adding 1 and the inner result. Let me make sure I get this right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each step as starting with 3*(1 + inner result). Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see it as a series of nested expressions where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then each layer wraps that with 3*(1 + ...). So, let me structure it step by step.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote each step as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\na1 = 1 + 3\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2\n\n...\n\nUp to a9, since there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 3s, I think. Let me count the number of 3s after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each inner part is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times 3 is multiplied after each 1+.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, there are eight more 3s, each inside the parentheses. Wait, let me check:\n\nEach layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + ...). Let me count the number of times 3( occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the first 3, each time it's 3(1+3(...)), so the number of such layers is 9, because after the first 3, there are 8 more 3s inside.

Let me see: Each time I compute a_i, it's 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, but the entire expression is 3*(a9), where a9 is the innermost expression. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each a_i is 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a1 = 1 + 3.\n\nBut in the expression, each a_i is part of a larger 3*(1 + a_i). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and then each time multiply by 3 and add 1.\n\nWait, let me try again.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Step 9) = 3*29524\n\nWait, but let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the innermost is Step 1: 1 + 3, then each step adds another layer. So, Step 9 would be the outermost, which is 3*(Step 8). Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ... ) layers.\n\nEach \"3*(1 + ...)\" is a layer. Let's count how many times we have 3*(1 + ...):\n\nAfter the first 3, each time it's 3*(1 + ...), so let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3*(...))\n- Then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n- This continues until we reach the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 3*(1 + ... is a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 8 more 3s inside the parentheses. Wait, let me count:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- This continues until we get to the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 inside adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times 3( appears in the expression:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of 3(, so there are 9 layers. So, each layer is a 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, perhaps I should compute each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + inner result). So, perhaps I should compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer's result). Let me try that.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I was computing a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, but perhaps that's not accurate because each layer is 3*(1 + inner result), not 1 + 3*inner result.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next inner layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer out: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check my steps again because I think I'm making a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try again, carefully.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, the entire expression is Layer 9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because 36084 seems a bit high, but perhaps that's correct. Let me check each step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried computing a_i as 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, I got a9 as 29524, but that approach was wrong because I wasn't multiplying by 3 at each step. So, the correct approach is to compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), which gives 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I let L_i be the value at layer i, then:\n\nL_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not right because L_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4, and then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, as before.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to model this is to recognize that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from 4.\n\nSo, the recursion is L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for this recursion. Let me try that.\n\nThe recursion is L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write this as L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n\n\nA particular solution can be found as a constant, say L_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nC - 3*C = 3\n\n-2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\n3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nA = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nThus, L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2\n\nSimilarly, 3/2 is just 3/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nNow, since we have n=9, let's compute L_9:\n\nL_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo, L_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^8:\n\n3^8 is 3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 11*6561: 6561*10=65610, plus 6561=72171\n\n72171 - 3 = 72168\n\n72168 divided by 2 is 36084.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nwe start by computing from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. Each layer is of the form \\(3 \\times (1 + \\text{previous result})\\).\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n3.

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses! Let me see if I can break it down. It looks like each layer has a similar structure, so maybe I can work from the innermost part outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is \"1 + 3\". Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another \"1 + 3(...)\" where the ... is the result of the innermost part. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, this becomes:\n\n1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that. First, multiply 3*4, which is 12. Then add 1:\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another \"1 + 3*(...)\" where the ... is now 13. So, let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*13\n\nFirst, 3*13 is 39, then add 1:\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nOkay, so that layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me try to see if each layer is just multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the operation is: new_result = 1 + 3*previous_result.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we had:\n\nStart: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, let me compute that step again. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, so next is 121.\n\nContinuing:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that.\n\n3*121: 121*3. Let me compute that. 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo, that layer is 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo, that's 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093. Let's break that down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nSo, that layer is 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo, that's 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let me do this step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that computation again because 9841*3 is 29523, right? Let me verify:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n9841\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n= 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nThen, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nSo, that layer is 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*88573.\n\nCompute 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n88573 * 3.\n\n3*3=9\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2\n\n8*3=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2 (but since there are no more digits, write 26 as 26?)\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it properly.\n\nWait, 88573 is a 5-digit number: 8,8,5,7,3.\n\nSo, 3*3=9\n\n3*7=21, write 1, carryover 2\n\n3*5=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2\n\n3*8=24 +2=26, write 6, carryover 2\n\nBut since we're at the leftmost digit, we write the carryover. So, the result is 265719.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n88573 * 3:\n\n3*3=9\n\n3*7=21, write 1, carryover 2\n\n3*5=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2\n\n3*8=24 +2=26, write 6, carryover 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover as 2, so the number is 265719.\n\nWait, let me verify with another method.\n\nCompute 88573 * 3:\n\n80,000 *3=240,000\n\n8,000*3=24,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n70*3=210\n\n3*3=9\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n240,000 +24,000=264,000\n\n264,000 +1,500=265,500\n\n265,500 +210=265,710\n\n265,710 +9=265,719.\n\nYes, so 88573*3=265,719.\n\nSo, 1 + 265,719 = 265,720.\n\nSo, that layer is 265,720.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation.

So each step involves computing 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nLet me write down each step systematically.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving to Level 2, which is 1 + 3*(Level 1 result)\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result)\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result)\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result)\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result)\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result)\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result)\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result)\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the levels. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so starting from the innermost, which is the 9th level, I think I should work up to the outermost level, which is the first one. Wait, maybe I got the levels reversed. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), that's the first level. Then each subsequent level adds another 3*(previous result). So, maybe I should label them from the inside out as Level 1 to Level 9.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost Level 9 result. So, after computing Level 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nWell, 3 * 29000 = 87000\n\n3 * 524 = 1572\n\nSo, 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each level was correctly computed because if any level was wrong, the final result would be off.\n\nLet me go through each level again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't miscount the levels. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" corresponds to a level. Let me count the number of 3s before the first (1+3):\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... So that's the outermost 3. Then inside that, another 3, and so on until the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels because each \"3(\" adds another level. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), which is the first level. Then each subsequent 3 adds another level. So, if I have 9 sets of parentheses, that would correspond to 9 levels. So my earlier calculation of Level 9 being 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by the outermost 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a pattern here. Each level seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula instead of computing each level manually, in case I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 3D + 1\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a geometric series.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWhich is exactly the innermost part of our original problem.\n\nWe can express a_n as a sum of a geometric series. Let's write it out:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term is multiplied by 3, but let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the expression a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}\n\nWait, no, because each level adds another 3^k term. Let me test for n=1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1.\n\nn=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nn=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, but 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 is 40, yes. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nWait, but the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches our earlier formula.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure that the number of terms is correct. Since each a_n corresponds to n levels, and the original expression has 9 levels, so n=9, which gives a_9=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the entire expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nWith 9 sets of parentheses, so 9 levels. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each level adds another 3*(...). So, yes, a_9 is the result after 9 levels, and then multiplied by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but let me try another way to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it from right to left: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't make any mistake in the earlier levels because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me check a few levels again.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; total 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThus, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses! Let me try to break it down from the inside out because that's usually the way to handle these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nFirst, I'll rewrite the expression to make it clearer, maybe by numbering the parentheses or something. But actually, let's just start from the innermost part and work our way out. So, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4.\n\nSo now, moving one level out, we have another (1 + 3(...)), where the inner part is now 4. Let's compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4. Wait, hold on, is it 1 + 3*(result) or is it 1 + 3*(something else)? Let me check the original expression.\n\nLooking back, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nFirst innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the order. Let me think again. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)).\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define each level from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nLet me label them as level 1 to level 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, counting the number of 3(...) expressions: starting from the first 3, then each 3(...) is another layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression and work my way out.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Each time, it's another layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, hold on. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of substitution. Let me compute the innermost first.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3):\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer1).

So, 3*(1 + 13) = 3*14 = 42.\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to outline the structure:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nCompute (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this value V1.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*V1). So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this V2.\n\nNext layer out: (1 + 3*V2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. V3 = 40.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*V3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*V9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again to make sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n= 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the structure of the expression because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nLet me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nFrom the expression, after the initial 3(, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so there are 9 layers.\n\nSo, starting from layer 1 as the innermost (1 + 3), then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), and so on up to layer 9, which is the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), and then multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had V1 to V9, each corresponding to a layer, and then the final result is 3*V9.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recursive sequence or find a pattern.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c)\n\nWait, perhaps better to write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9,\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and even derived a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, which confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner expression by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that the value of the innermost expression propagates outward, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3. The detailed step-by-step computation confirms that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " It looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it won't be so bad. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nSo, let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, I see multiple instances of \"1 + 3(...)\" nested within each other. The innermost one is \"1 + 3\". Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another \"1 + 3(...)\" where the inner part is now the result we just got. So, the next layer is:\n1 + 3(4)\n\nLet me compute that. First, multiply 3 by 4, which is 12, then add 1:\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so that layer gives me 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have:\n1 + 3(13)\n\nAgain, I'll compute the multiplication first:\n3 * 13 = 39\nThen add 1:\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, that's 40. Next layer out is:\n1 + 3(40)\n\nCompute 3 * 40 first:\n3 * 40 = 120\nThen add 1:\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, so that's 121. Moving out another layer, we have:\n1 + 3(121)\n\nCompute 3 * 121:\n3 * 121 = 363\nThen add 1:\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nGot it, 364. Next layer:\n1 + 3(364)\n\nCompute 3 * 364:\n3 * 364 = 1092\nThen add 1:\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nOkay, that's 1093. Now, moving another layer out, we have:\n1 + 3(1093)\n\nCompute 3 * 1093:\n3 * 1093 = 3279\nThen add 1:\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nAlright, so that's 3280. Next layer:\n1 + 3(3280)\n\nCompute 3 * 3280:\n3 * 3280 = 9840\nThen add 1:\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nHmm, 9841. Moving out another layer, we have:\n1 + 3(9841)\n\nCompute 3 * 9841:\n3 * 9841 = 29523\nThen add 1:\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, that's 29524. Next layer:\n1 + 3(29524)\n\nCompute 3 * 29524:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\nThen add 1:\n1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nSo, that's 88573. Now, moving out another layer, we have:\n1 + 3(88573)\n\nCompute 3 * 88573:\n3 * 88573 = 265719\nThen add 1:\n1 + 265719 = 265720\n\nAlright, so that's 265720. Next layer:\n1 + 3(265720)\n\nCompute 3 * 265720:\n3 * 265720 = 797160\nThen add 1:\n1 + 797160 = 797161\n\nWow, that's a big number. So, that's 797161. Now, moving out another layer, we have:\n1 + 3(797161)\n\nCompute 3 * 797161:\n3 * 797161 = 2391483\nThen add 1:\n1 + 2391483 = 2391484\n\nOkay, so that's 2391484. Next layer:\n1 + 3(2391484)\n\nCompute 3 * 2391484:\n3 * 2391484 = 7174452\nThen add 1:\n1 + 7174452 = 7174453\n\nHmm, that's 7174453. Finally, moving out to the outermost layer, we have:\n1 + 3(7174453)\n\nCompute 3 * 7174453:\n3 * 7174453 = 21523359\nThen add 1:\n1 + 21523359 = 21523360\n\nAlright, so that's 21523360. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, we have:\n\n3 * 21523360\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 21,523,360.\n\nFirst, 21,523,360 * 3:\n21,523,360 * 3 = 64,570,080\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nBreaking it down:\n20,000,000 * 3 = 60,000,000\n1,523,360 * 3 = 4,570,080\nAdding them together: 60,000,000 + 4,570,080 = 64,570,080\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 3 * 21,523,360 = 64,570,080\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 64,570,080.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or miscalculate somewhere. It's easy to make an error with such large numbers. Let me go through each step quickly again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1 + 3 = 4\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n1 + 3*797161 = 1 + 2391483 = 2391484\n1 + 3*2391484 = 1 + 7174452 = 7174453\n1 + 3*7174453 = 1 + 21523359 = 21523360\n\nThen, 3 * 21523360 = 64,570,080\n\nHmm, seems consistent. I think I did each step correctly. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 64,570,080.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{64570080}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s, and it's all multiplied by 3 at the beginning. Let me write it down to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses! It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses, each containing 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. The very last part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down:\n\n1 + 3*(previous result)\n\nSo, the next step is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so that simplifies the next layer to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times this new result. Let's compute that:\n\n1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so that layer simplifies to 40. Continuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 40. Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's a bigger number. Let me keep going.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWhoa, 364. That's a jump. Let's move out another layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first.\n\n3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, now we're getting into the thousands. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nLet me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nAlright, so that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nLet's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThat's a big number, 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOkay, so that's 29524. Now, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nAlright, so now we're at 88573. Next layer: 1 + 3*88573.\n\nCalculating 3*88573. Let me do this step by step: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nSo, that simplifies the next layer to 265720. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 3*(previous result).\n\nWait, let me check. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, once I've computed the innermost part all the way out, the last step is to multiply that result by 3.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss a step. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nWait, so after the innermost parentheses, each step adds another layer, so in total, there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me count the steps:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nWait, so that's nine layers. So, after the ninth layer, the result is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went beyond nine layers. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to nine layers. So, when I computed up to 29524, that's after nine layers. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, I think I went one step too far earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing, I went beyond nine layers, getting to 265720, but that was because I miscounted the layers. So, actually, the correct result is 88572.\n\nLet me verify this by working through the layers again more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me try computing it step by step again, perhaps using a different approach or checking for any calculation errors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's see if this forms a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each step as a_i, where a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the result after nine layers.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nSo, for n=1 to 9, compute f(n):\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, I think I can be sure that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to expand the expression step by step, but that would be time-consuming given the number of layers. However, since each step is linear and depends only on the previous step, using recursion or iterative computation is the most efficient way.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check the multiplication steps again:\n\n3*29524:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524*3 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying the calculations, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3*(...). By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by the outermost 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " It's a bit of a long expression with a lot of nested parentheses. Let me write it down to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. It looks like each part is similar, so maybe there's a pattern here that I can figure out. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nStarting from the very inside, I see the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 is 4. That simplifies that part. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, the next part is 3(4). Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12. So, that simplifies the next level.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, I have (1 + 12). Let me compute that: 1 + 12 is 13. Then, moving out another layer, it's 3 times 13. 3 times 13 is 39. So, that's another step done.\n\nMoving out again, I have (1 + 39). That's 40. Then, 3 times 40 is 120. So, now we're at 120. Next layer is (1 + 120), which is 121. Then, 3 times 121 is 363.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is (1 + 363) which is 364. Then, 3 times 364 is... hmm, let me calculate that. 364 times 3: 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, that's 1092.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 1092) which is 1093. Then, 3 times 1093: Let me do that. 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nNext layer is (1 + 3279) which is 3280. Then, 3 times 3280: 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, that's 9840.\n\nContinuing outward, the next part is (1 + 9840) which is 9841. Then, 3 times 9841: Let me compute that. 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding all those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nSo, now, the next layer is (1 + 29523) which is 29524. Then, 3 times 29524: Let's break it down. 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but I think it's correct. Let me verify the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Yes, 29524 times 3: 29524 + 29524 is 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is (1 + 88572), which is 88573. Then, 3 times 88573: Let me calculate that. 80000 times 3 is 240000, 8000 times 3 is 24000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding all those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719.\n\nSo, now, the next part is (1 + 265719) which is 265720. Then, 3 times 265720: Let me compute that. 200000 times 3 is 600000, 60000 times 3 is 180000, 5000 times 3 is 15000, 700 times 3 is 2100, 20 times 3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. 265720 times 3: 265720 + 265720 is 531440, plus another 265720 is 797160. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, we have (1 + 797160) which is 797161. Then, finally, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3 times 797161: Let me compute that. 700000 times 3 is 2100000, 90000 times 3 is 270000, 7000 times 3 is 21000, 100 times 3 is 300, 60 times 3 is 180, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding all those together: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483.\n\nLet me verify that multiplication: 797161 times 3. 700000*3 is 2100000, 90000*3 is 270000, 7000*3 is 21000, 100*3 is 300, 60*3 is 180, 1*3 is 3. Adding them: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000; 2370000 + 21000 = 2391000; 2391000 + 300 = 2391300; 2391300 + 180 = 2391480; 2391480 + 3 = 2391483. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step involved computing the innermost expression, multiplying by 3, adding 1, then multiplying by 3 again, and so on. It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down step by step, I managed to get through each layer without making a mistake. I think I did each multiplication correctly, and the final result seems reasonable given the size of the numbers involved.\n\nI guess another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula that could simplify the computation, especially since there are so many layers. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar? Let me think about that for a moment.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is of the form 3(1 + 3(...)), which suggests that each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). If I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, maybe I can find a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 3(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 3(1 + 3) = 12, as I computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is 3 times (1 plus the previous term). So, a_2 = 3(1 + 12) = 39, a_3 = 3(1 + 39) = 120, and so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers of 3s.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s. Starting from the innermost, each 3 is part of a multiplication. Let me see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time you have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), so each layer adds another 3. Let me count the number of 3s in the original problem.\n\nLooking back: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), and inside each parenthesis, there's another 3, until the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many 3s are there? Let's count the number of times 3 appears as a multiplier.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside another parenthesis. Let's see: the expression is 3(...), inside which is 3(...), and so on, 9 times? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time there's a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's count the number of 3s:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Therefore, there are 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 after adding 1. So, the sequence a_n has n=9 terms, starting from a_1 = 12, a_2 = 39, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, if I can model this as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a closed-form solution instead of computing each term step by step.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 12.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, nonhomogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n = c + d a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A * 3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3\n\n-2K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A * 3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 12.\n\nSo,\n\n12 = A * 3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n12 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n12 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nConvert 12 to halves: 24/2 + 3/2 = 27/2\n\nSo,\n\n27/2 = 3A\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nA = (27/2) / 3 = 9/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (9/2) * 3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (9 * 3^n - 3)/2\n\nWe can factor out a 3:\n\na_n = 3(3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's see: 9 * 3^n is 3^{n+2}, so:\n\na_n = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2\n\nAlternatively, factoring 3:\n\na_n = 3(3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nBut let's check for n=1:\n\na_1 = 3(1 + 3) = 12\n\nUsing the formula: (3^{1+2} - 3)/2 = (27 - 3)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\na_2 = 3(1 + 12) = 39\n\nFormula: (3^{2+2} - 3)/2 = (81 - 3)/2 = 78/2 = 39. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = 3(1 + 39) = 120\n\nFormula: (3^{3+2} - 3)/2 = (243 - 3)/2 = 240/2 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer:\n\na_9 = (3^{9+2} - 3)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I ended up with 2391483 as the final result. But according to this formula, a_9 is 88572, which is the value before the outermost multiplication by 3. Wait, hold on, maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 9 layers of 3s. But in my recurrence, a_n corresponds to the nth layer, starting from a_1 as the innermost. So, the total expression is 3 times a_9, right?\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 is the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, but in my previous step-by-step, I started with (1 + 3) = 4, then 3*4=12, which would be a_1=12. But in the formula, a_n is defined as 3(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1=12.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula to match the problem.\n\nIn the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the innermost expression. Wait, no, actually, a_1 would be the innermost, and the outermost is 3*(1 + a_9). So, the total expression is 3*(1 + a_9). Therefore, the value we need is 3*(1 + a_9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I computed all the way to 3*(1 + 797160) = 2391483, which would correspond to 3*(1 + a_9), where a_9 was 797160. But according to the formula, a_9 = 88572. So, 3*(1 + 88572) = 3*88573 = 265719, which doesn't match my step-by-step result. So, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s that are multiplying the parentheses:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 3s. Therefore, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, a_2 = 3*(1 + 12) = 39, and so on up to a_9.\n\nBut in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9). Wait, no, because the innermost is a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 39, and so on, until a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8). So, the entire expression is a_9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(1 + a_8), which is a_9.\n\nWait, no, let's parse the original expression:\n\nIt's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, up to the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I started with (1 + 3) = 4, then 3*4=12, then (1 + 12)=13, then 3*13=39, etc. So, each step alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect in terms of defining a_n.\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12. Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + 12) = 39, a_3 = 3*(1 + 39) = 120, etc., up to a_9.\n\nBut in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9). Wait, no, because a_9 is already 3*(1 + a_8). So, the entire expression is a_9. So, the value of the entire expression is a_9, which according to the formula is (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572. But in my step-by-step, I ended up with 2391483, which is much larger. So, clearly, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let me go back to the step-by-step computation and see where I might have gone wrong.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*4 = 12\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n4. 3*13 = 39\n5. (1 + 39) = 40\n6. 3*40 = 120\n7. (1 + 120) = 121\n8. 3*121 = 363\n9. (1 + 363) = 364\n10. 3*364 = 1092\n11. (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. 3*1093 = 3279\n13. (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. 3*3280 = 9840\n15. (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. 3*9841 = 29523\n17. (1 + 29523) = 29524\n18. 3*29524 = 88572\n19. (1 + 88572) = 88573\n20. 3*88573 = 265719\n21. (1 + 265719) = 265720\n22. 3*265720 = 797160\n23. (1 + 797160) = 797161\n24. 3*797161 = 2391483\n\nWait, so according to this, the entire expression is 2391483. But according to the recurrence formula, a_9 should be 88572, which is step 18 in the step-by-step. So, perhaps the confusion is about how many layers there are.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3s. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is step 1: 4. Then, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that the outermost operation is the 9th layer, which is step 24 in the step-by-step.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 = 88572, which is step 18. So, perhaps the formula counts the layers differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula defines a_n as the nth layer starting from the innermost, so a_1 is the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, but in my step-by-step, I started with (1 + 3) = 4, then multiplied by 3 to get 12, which would be a_1 in the formula.\n\nWait, let me redefine:\n\nLet me define a_1 as the innermost expression: a_1 = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had a different result. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that the outermost operation is the 9th layer.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 2391483, which is much larger than 36084. So, perhaps my initial step-by-step was incorrect.\n\nWait, let me try to compute it again, but this time carefully, step by step, to see where I went wrong.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo:\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, according to this, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had a different approach, where I alternated between adding 1 and multiplying by 3, but perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I had 24 steps, which suggests 12 layers, but the problem only has 9 layers. So, I think I was mistakenly adding an extra layer each time.\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...), up to the innermost (1 + 3). So, the number of 3s is 9, meaning 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is the one where I ended up with 36084, not 2391483.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 24 steps, which would be 12 layers, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, the computation should have 9 layers, as above, resulting in 36084.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had more layers because I was counting both the addition and multiplication as separate steps, which might have confused the layer count.\n\nSo, to clarify, each layer is defined by a 3*(1 + ...), so each layer corresponds to one 3 and one set of parentheses. Therefore, 9 layers mean 9 such operations.\n\nTherefore, the correct value is 36084.\n\nBut wait, according to the recurrence formula, a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. But in the step-by-step, I got 36084.\n\nWait, that suggests that my recurrence formula is not correctly aligned with the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a different starting point. Let me redefine the recurrence properly.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, for n=1, it's 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nFor n=2, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 12.\n\nThen, solving the recurrence as before:\n\na_n = 3 + 3a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it as:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution is a constant K, so K = 3 + 3K => K = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 12:\n\n12 = A*3^1 - 3/2\n\n12 = 3A - 1.5\n\n3A = 13.5\n\nA = 4.5 = 9/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (9*3^n - 3)/2 = 3*(3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for n=9:\n\na_9 = 3*(3^9 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = 3*(19683 - 1)/2 = 3*(19682)/2 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had a_9 as 36084, which is different. So, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, let's compute a_9 step by step:\n\na_1 = 12\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nWait, so according to this, a_9 is 88572, which matches the formula: a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had a different approach where I alternated between adding 1 and multiplying by 3, leading to a different result. So, I think the confusion arises from how the layers are defined.\n\nWait, perhaps in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9), where a_9 is the value of the innermost expression with 9 layers. But in my step-by-step, I computed up to a_9 = 88572, which is already the value after 9 layers. Therefore, the entire expression is a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had 24 steps,"

    "text": " It's a bit of a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, and I need to compute it step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It looks like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). I think I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because each parenthesis depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. I'll start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, step 1: Compute (1 + 3)\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the result we just got, which is 4. So, let me compute that next.\n\nStep 2: Compute (1 + 3*4)\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each step involves multiplying by 3 after adding 1 and the result of the inner expression.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify the structure. Let me parse the expression properly.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out. There are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nBut let me double-check this because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer from the inside.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a multiplication error. Let me recompute each step:\n\na_1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, the final answer is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 3 each time, it's more like a linear recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model it as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWith a_1 = 4\n\nSo, solving this recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C => C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nThus, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nNow, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nSo, 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nThen subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nDivide by 6: 216,504 / 6\n\nDivide step by step:\n\n6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3\n\n6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0\n\n6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5\n\n6 into 50 is 8, remainder 2\n\n6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0\n\n6 into 0 is 0\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute 216,504 \u00f7 6:\n\n6 * 36,000 = 216,000\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84\n\nSo total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 3 times (1 plus the result of the inner expression). By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 15\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 48\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 147\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 444\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 1335\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 4008\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 12027\\)\n9. Outermost layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 36084\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

It looks like a chain of expressions where each one is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Maybe I can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1+3). That seems straightforward. So, let's compute that first.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Wait, let me check that. The next level is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, if the innermost was 4, then the next one is 1 + 3*4.\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so now we have 13. Moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so that's 40. Let me go another level out. The next one is 1 + 3*(40).\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nAlright, 121. Moving out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(121).\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nOkay, 364. Next, we go out another level. So, 1 + 3*(364).\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWow, that's getting big. Let's keep going. Next level is 1 + 3*(1093).\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nHmm, 3280. Now, moving out another level, we have 1 + 3*(3280).\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThat's a pretty large number, 9841. Let me check if I did that correctly. 3*3280 is indeed 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Okay, moving on.\n\nThe next level out is 1 + 3*(9841).\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWhoa, 29524. Now, moving out another level, the expression is 1 + 3*(29524).\n\n10. Next level: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nAlright, so 88573 is the result of the next level. Now, the outermost expression is 3*(this result). Wait, let me make sure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost, we worked our way out each time, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, except the very outermost is just multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me check the structure again. The entire expression is 3*(...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each step out is 1 + 3*(previous result), and this happens 8 times, right? Because each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the problem again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, there are 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, no, actually, each 1+3(...) is inside another set. Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then, each time, it's 1+3*(...). So, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me see: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then, moving out, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, let's count how many times we did that.\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, we have 88573. But the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing all the inner layers up to 88573, which is the result of the innermost 9 layers, we then have to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1+3), which is 4, then each layer out is 1 + 3*(previous). So, after 8 layers, we reach the point where the outermost is 3*(...). Let me recount the layers properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list each step with the corresponding layer.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer1, and each time we go out, we add another layer until Layer9, which is the innermost part of the outermost expression.\n\nWait, no, let me parse the expression correctly. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) which is Layer1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first ( is Layer1: 1+3.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have 1 + 3(...). So, each 3(...) is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there?\n\nFrom the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...), so that's Layer2, Layer3, etc.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) in the expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(1+3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, we have 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*(88573).\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost 9 layers, which gives 88573, we then have 3*(88573).\n\nWait, no. Let me parse the structure again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, each layer out is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer10). Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the entire nested expression which results in Layer10.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nBut the entire expression is 3*(Layer10). So, after computing Layer10 as 88573, we have to multiply by 3.\n\nSo, final result is 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 * 88573:\n\nFirst, 3 * 80000 = 240000\n\n3 * 8000 = 24000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 70 = 210\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute 88573 * 3 step by step.\n\n88573 * 3:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, carryover 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n3 * 88573:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n3*8 = 24 +1 =25, write down 5, carryover 2\n\n3*8 =24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2\n\nBut since we're at the highest digit, we write down 26 as 26.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 88573 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number.\n\nWait, let me do it properly.\n\n88573 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carryover 2\n\nSince there are no more digits, write down the carryover 2.\n\nSo, the result is 265719.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n88573 * 3:\n\nCompute 80000 *3 =240000\n\n8000*3=24000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n70*3=210\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding them up:\n\n240000 +24000 =264000\n\n264000 +1500=265500\n\n265500 +210=265710\n\n265710 +9=265719\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 265719.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there?\n\nFrom the expression, after the first 3*(, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3*(...)). So, that would mean 9 layers, right?\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 10 layers, but perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first (1 + 3) is Layer1.\n\nThen, each 3*(...) adds another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1+3) =4\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nLayer10:1 +3*29524=88573\n\nSo, after Layer10, which is the result of the innermost expression, we have to multiply by 3 as per the outermost 3*(...). So, the final result is 3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, but let me check the structure again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1+3), and each layer out adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each ( is a new layer.\n\nSo, the first ( after 3 is Layer1: 1+3.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 Layer1: (1+3)\n\nBut wait, that's not accurate. Each ( after the first 3 is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each time we have a 3*(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, the number of times we apply the 1 + 3*(...) is equal to the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression, how many times does 1 + 3*(...) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first occurrence.\n\nThen, moving out, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does that happen?\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) in the expression.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer1\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer1) \u2192 Layer2\n\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer2) \u2192 Layer3\n\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer3) \u2192 Layer4\n\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer4) \u2192 Layer5\n\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer5) \u2192 Layer6\n\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer6) \u2192 Layer7\n\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer7) \u2192 Layer8\n\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer8) \u2192 Layer9\n\n10. 1 + 3*(Layer9) \u2192 Layer10\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer10). So, after computing Layer10 as 88573, we multiply by 3 to get 265719.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3)=4, which is Layer1.\n\nThen, each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer2 is 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nLayer10:1 +3*29524=88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer10)=3*88573=265719.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n\n-2*a_p =1\n\na_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_p + a_n^h = -1/2 + C*3^n\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = -1/2 + C*3^1\n\n4 = -1/2 + 3C\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = -1/2 + (3/2)*3^n = -1/2 + (3^{n+1})/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have?\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3)=4, which is a_1=4.\n\nThen, each layer out adds another term, so the outermost expression is a_9, since we have 9 layers after the initial 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the innermost is a_1=4.\n\nThen, moving out, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=88573.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, a_9=88573.\n\nWait, let me check with the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nWait, but earlier, we had Layer9 as 29524, and Layer10 as 88573.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, in our earlier step-by-step, we had:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nLayer10:88573\n\nSo, according to the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3, a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches.\n\nn=4, a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches.\n\nn=5, a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, which matches.\n\nn=6, a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, which matches.\n\nn=7, a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, which matches.\n\nn=8, a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, which matches.\n\nn=9, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches.\n\nn=10, a_10=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573, which matches.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the value after n layers is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), because the innermost is a_1=4, and we have 9 layers up to a_9=29524, then the outermost expression is 3*(a_9)=3*29524=88572, but wait, that contradicts our earlier step-by-step where a_10=88573=3*29524 +1?\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, according to the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2\n\nSo, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524\n\nThen, the next layer, a_10=(3^{11}-1)/2= (177147-1)/2=88573.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(a_9)=3*29524=88572, but according to our step-by-step, a_10=88573=3*29524 +1.\n\nWait, that suggests that the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) +1? No, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3)=4=a_1\n\nThen, each layer is 1 +3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, a_2=1+3*a1=1+12=13\n\na3=1+3*a2=1+39=40\n\n...\n\na10=1+3*a9=1+3*29524=88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a10=3*88573=265719.\n\nSo, using the formula, a10=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573\n\nThus, the final result is 3*a10=3*(3^{11}-1)/2= (3^{12}-3)/2\n\nWait, 3^{12}=531441\n\nSo, (531441 -3)/2=531438/2=265719, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 265719.\n\nI think I've confirmed it through both step-by-step computation and using the formula for the recursive sequence. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3*(...). We start by computing the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the formula for the nth term of this recursive sequence, we find that after 9 layers, the value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\n**Layer 1 (L1):** 1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, L1 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2 (L2):** 1 + 3(L1)\n\nWe just found L1 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nSo, L2 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3 (L3):** 1 + 3(L2)\n\nL2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nSo, L3 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4 (L4):** 1 + 3(L3)\n\nL3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nSo, L4 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5 (L5):** 1 + 3(L4)\n\nL4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nSo, L5 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6 (L6):** 1 + 3(L5)\n\nL5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364.\n\nCalculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nSo, L6 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7 (L7):** 1 + 3(L6)\n\nL6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nSo, L7 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8 (L8):** 1 + 3(L7)\n\nL7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nSo, L8 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9 (L9):** 1 + 3(L8)\n\nL8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841.\n\nFirst, 3*9000 is 27000.\n\n3*800 is 2400.\n\n3*40 is 120.\n\n3*1 is 3.\n\nAdding them all up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nSo, L9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be error-prone.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from L1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L1 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis recurrence can be represented as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation.\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nAssume solution L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for L9, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nThus, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I let S be the innermost expression, but it's nested nine times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for a geometric series with ratio 3 and nine terms.\n\nWait, but let's see.\n\nThe innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, the number of terms is 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nSo, it's like 3 multiplied by a sum where each term is 3^{k} for k from 0 to 8, but let me think.\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's more like a geometric series with ratio 3, but each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, let's try to represent the entire expression as a sum.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))).\n\nLet me see, if I let the innermost part be S = 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*S, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*S), etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model it as a sum.\n\nWait, each time you have 1 + 3*something, so each layer adds another 1 and multiplies by 3. So, maybe the total expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))).\n\nBut perhaps it's similar to a geometric series with 9 terms.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nIf I have n layers, each being 1 + 3*previous, then the total expression would be 3*(sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k).\n\nWait, because each layer adds another 3^k term.\n\nWait, for example, with n=1, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then 3*4=12.\n\nWait, no, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series.\n\nWait, in the expression E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), if we let E be the entire expression, then the part inside the first 3*(...) is similar to E/3.\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps E = 3*(1 + E/3). Wait, that might not hold because each layer is only 9 deep.\n\nWait, maybe that approach is for an infinite series, but here it's finite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, considering that each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which can be represented as a sum.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on up to L9.\n\nAs we found earlier, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the entire expression as a sum.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand it step by step.\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nWait, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and there are 9 layers, then the value at each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer), starting from the innermost layer and moving outward. \n\nAfter computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost expression after nine layers is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way out. That way, I can simplify each layer step by step. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Each time there's a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, so each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let me see... starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers of parentheses here, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Let me confirm that. Each time I replace the innermost part, I move one layer out. So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, actually, the way the problem is written, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so maybe it's better to think of each step as computing the innermost expression first.\n\nLet me try to write each step down.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute 1 + 3\nThat's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 1)\nSo that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that:\n3*4 = 12\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2)\nWhich is 1 + 3*13\n3*13 = 39\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 1 + 3*(40)\n3*40 = 120\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: Next layer: 1 + 3*(121)\n3*121 = 363\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: Next layer: 1 + 3*(364)\n3*364 = 1092\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093)\n3*1093 = 3279\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280)\n3*3280 = 9840\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(9841)\n3*9841 = 29523\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check that. Because the problem is written as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo the very outermost part is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So after Step 9, which gives 29524, that's the result inside the outermost parentheses. So the final step is to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me recount the layers because I might have miscounted.\n\nLooking at the problem again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of times 3 is multiplied is equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n9. (1 + 3(...\n\nSo that's nine layers of parentheses, each time with 1 + 3*(...). So when I did Step 1 to Step 9, that was each time going one layer out. But then the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of Step 9.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...). So each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So perhaps my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, but when I did Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nBut then, the outermost expression is 3*(result from Step 9), so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that would make the total number of layers 10? Because the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to count the number of 3s in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), so each time, it's a multiplication by 3. Let me count the number of times 3 is used in the expression.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is the outermost multiplier.\n\nThen, inside each parenthesis, there's a 3:\n\n2. The first inner 3 is at the first parenthesis: 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo that's two 3s so far.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Each time after a parenthesis, it's 3*(...). So let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo each time, after the opening parenthesis, it's 3 multiplied by something.\n\nSo, how many times does 3 appear as a multiplier? Let's count:\n\n1. The outermost 3.\n\nThen, each layer inside:\n\n2. 3*(...)\n3. 3*(...)\n4. 3*(...)\n5. 3*(...)\n6. 3*(...)\n7. 3*(...)\n8. 3*(...)\n9. 3*(...)\n10. 3*(...)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost is 1 + 3, so that's the 10th 3? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, each with a 3 multiplier, and the outermost 3 is separate. So total layers would be 10.\n\nWait, but let me try to visualize the expression again.\n\nLet me write it step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me check each step again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so let's count the number of times \"3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is the outermost.\n\n2. Then, each time inside, another 3, so:\n\n3(1 + 3(...)) has two 3s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each \"3(\" is a new layer, so the number of layers is the number of times \"3(\" occurs.\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time I see \"3(\", that's a new layer.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n10. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, that seems like 10 layers, but perhaps the innermost is just 1 + 3, without another 3*(...), so maybe it's 9 layers.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, so that would be 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\" and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, total layers are 10? Or is the outermost 3 part of the count?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the expression as starting with 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 more layers of 3*(...). Let me try to recount.\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that's 8 layers after the innermost. Wait, no, because from the innermost to the outermost, we have:\n\nInnermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3, making a total of 10 layers, but perhaps the outermost 3 is the 10th layer. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think that the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time you go out, you add another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that seems to be 10 steps, but I think the outermost 3 is the 10th step. So, the total value is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 10: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each step checks out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there? Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after the first 3, each time there's another opening parenthesis. Let's count:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n9. (1 + 3(...\n\nSo, that's 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. So, that would mean 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Therefore, after computing up to 29524, we have to multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...) and then the outermost 3.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: recognizing this as a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7    3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating the innermost expression first and then substituting the result into the next outer layer until the entire expression is simplified.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Layer:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
