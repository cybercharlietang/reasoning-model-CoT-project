Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the ninth layer, which equals 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
