Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3.

So, each layer is computed correctly, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, L_9 =29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then:\n\nTotal expression = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, Total expression = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, whether computing step by step, using the recurrence relation, or using the closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and multiple methods lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula to compute the innermost layer and then work outward. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses.\n2. Compute each layer using the formula L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n3. Derive a closed-form formula for the layers using the recurrence relation.\n4. Apply the formula to find the value of the innermost layer.\n5. Multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, yes, it's 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there because that would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I could have used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}/2 -1/2)= (3^{11}/2 -3/2). Compute 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147/2 -3/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving this recurrence, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. Wait, that's not right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so let's write it as 2 9 5 2 4. Let me compute each digit step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry over 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry over 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry over 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry over 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry over 0\n\nWait, that's incorrect because 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (ones). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Ones place: 4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the steps.

Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute it as 29524 *3 = (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nHmm, seems like each step is accurate. So, I think the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40, etc., which is exactly what I did before. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a first-order linear recurrence, we can solve it iteratively or find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 \u2192 C -3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A -1/2 \u2192 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to get the same result. So, either way, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

This forms a linear recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Starting from the innermost parentheses, compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Continue this process up to Layer 9: 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification with a Formula**: Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, the result is confirmed to be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, maybe using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence. The general solution can be found using the formula for such recursions, which is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nTo find D, we can set the equation equal for steady-state: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9.\n\nSo, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by finding a general formula for the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer results in 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer, which is 29524.

Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.

Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Next: 3 (the ten-thousands place) * 3 = 9. So, writing it out: 9 (from the ten-thousands place), then 8 (from the thousands place), then 8 (from the hundreds place), then 5 (from the tens place), and 2 (from the units place). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplied by 3: 4*3=12 \u2192 units digit 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit 7, carryover 0. Next: 5*3=15 \u2192 hundreds digit 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands digit 8, carryover 0. Wait, but the original number is 29524, which is 2 ten thousands, so the next digit after thousands is ten thousands. So the digits would be:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens: 7\n- Hundreds: 5\n- Thousands: 8\n- Ten thousands: 8\n\nWait, that would make the number 88572, but that's only 5 digits.

So the number is 88572. Therefore, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because I might have made a mistake in the carryover.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 can be calculated as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Because if any of the layers were computed incorrectly, the final answer would be off.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. Is 3*9841 equal to 29523? Let me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25 \u2192 write 5, carryover 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29 \u2192 write 9, carryover 2\n\nWait, but 9841 is 9 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 4 (tens), 1 (units). So:\n\n1*3=3 \u2192 units digit 3.\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 tens digit 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25 \u2192 hundreds digit 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29 \u2192 thousands digit 9, carryover 2.\n\nWait, but that's only four digits. So the result would be 29523, which is correct because 9841 *3=29523.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so that's 9 layers. So, yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, my computation seems correct, leading to the final answer of 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that L_1 = 4, let's try to find A and B.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nAssuming that for n=0, L_0 would be 1 + 3*L_{-1}, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, since the recursion starts at n=1, perhaps we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nLet\u2019s assume L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*(29524) again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the number is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute 3^{10} = 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524, times 3 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. Next digit: 0 * 3 = 0, but since there are no more digits, it's just 0. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carry 1, write 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry 1, write 5. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry 2, write 8. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. There's no digit beyond that, so the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.

Let me check with another approach: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 87,572, but now with the breakdown, it's 88,572. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach.

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again: 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers seem correct, and the final multiplication is correct as well.

Let me see if that's the case.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI can see that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, each term is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, and a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = A*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula.\n\nBut since I didn't think of the formula initially, I did it step by step, which also worked.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. The final step is multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Wait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when I do multiple layers, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can notice a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9. So, we have a recursive formula a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Maybe we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that also gives the same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me recalculate 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 877572? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the number is 29524, which is five digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- Ten thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo writing it down: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 7 (units), 2 (units). Wait, that doesn't make sense because each digit should be in its place. Let me write it properly:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens: 7\n- Hundreds: 5\n- Thousands: 8\n- Ten thousands: 8\n\nSo the number is 88,572. Wait, that's 88572, which matches the earlier sum when I broke it down as 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572. So the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 87572, which was wrong because I must have miscounted the carries. So the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me verify this because when I computed each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Let me just go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression, which ends up being 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, each time, it's 1 + 3n. If I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term, that might save time instead of computing each layer.\n\nLet me see. Let's denote the value at each layer as a sequence a_k, where k is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each term is defined by a recurrence relation: a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_k.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous plus particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, which can be rewritten as a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_k = homogeneous + particular = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When k=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with k=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nk=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nk=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =81 -1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The formula a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So for k=9, that's (3^10 -1)/2=29524, correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes.\n\nSo, I think that's solid.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 87572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So yes, that's 87572. So, the final answer should be 87572. But wait, let me double-check all my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 87572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 87572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*something. If I let x be the innermost term, then each layer is 1 + 3x. But in this case, since there are multiple layers, it's more like a repeated application. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ... )). This is similar to a continued fraction or a geometric progression. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (9 layers), computing each step is manageable. However, if there were many more layers, we might look for a closed-form formula. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the solution can be expressed as L_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me see:\n\nIf L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute L_n for n=1: L1 = 4.\n\nn=2: L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nn=3: L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nn=4: L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nWait, let's see if this fits the formula (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But L1 is 4. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider solving the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L1.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches L2.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches L3.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, which matches L4.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the innermost layer in our problem, but wait, actually in our problem, the innermost layer was L1=4, and each subsequent layer goes up to L9. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nIn our earlier breakdown, we had 9 layers, starting from the innermost as Layer 1 and going out to Layer 9. But according to the formula, L_n corresponds to the nth layer, starting from n=1. So, if our innermost layer is Layer 1, then Layer 9 would correspond to n=9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, in terms of the formula, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=87572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can directly compute Layer 9 as (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 87572.\n\nThis confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or apply a formula to find the result efficiently. The final answer is 87572.\n\n$\\boxed{87572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. Let me see: If I expand the expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1)...)). Each layer adds another term. So, the innermost is 1, then 1 + 3*1, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*1), and so on. So, the entire expression can be seen as a sum of 3^k terms. Wait, maybe that's another way to approach it. Let me try to expand the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 13\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 121\nThen, 1 + 3*121 = 364\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nThen, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nThen, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, it's a geometric series with ratio 3. The number of terms would be 9, starting from 1 up to 3^8. Let me think: The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3*1)...))). If I expand all the parentheses, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1)...)). Each layer adds a power of 3. So, the total sum inside would be 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^8*1. That is, the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's just the innermost sum. But in our case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, perhaps it's similar but with an extra layer. Let me see: The innermost sum is 1 + 3*1 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2. Wait, because (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Similarly, (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Yes, so each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, for 9 layers, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Then, multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). This looks like a geometric series, but nested. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))). Each layer is a + b*(previous layer). If we have n layers, then the value can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, starting from the innermost. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^k. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_k^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, since L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let's list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis recursive relation can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let me try that.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the first few layers to make sure.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this another way or check for any possible miscalculations.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a closed-form expression, maybe I can compute a_9 directly using the formula without computing each layer.\n\nAs we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you're adding a layer, you're essentially multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the expansion of (3^{n} - 1)/2. So, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recursive formula to find the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). This forms a recursive sequence.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. The recurrence relation is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the initial condition \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence relation, we find:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: For the 9th layer:\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Final Computation**: Multiply by 3 as per the original expression:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 3*(previous). So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, how many layers in total? Let's count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. So, my earlier computation is correct, ending up with Layer 9 = 29,524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step, perhaps writing them down:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following the recurrence relation:\n\nLet a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it for this problem, especially since n=9 is manageable with step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that each layer is a geometric series, but again, since it's only nine layers, computing each step is straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, it's similar to a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 and an added constant term each time.\n\nBut regardless, the step-by-step approach worked, and I arrived at the final answer of 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just confirm the multiplication once more because that's a critical step.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Maybe I can see if each layer's result is correct.

So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which would allow me to compute this without going through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is built by this pattern. Let's say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. I think the solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall how to solve a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*c^n + (d/(c - 1)), where A is a constant determined by the initial condition. Let's apply that here. So, the general solution would be a_n = A*3^n + (1/(3 - 1)) = A*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3A + 0.5 => 3A = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5 => A = 3.5 / 3 = 7/6. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Let me simplify that. 3^n can be written as 3^n, so (7/6)*3^n is the same as (7*3^{n}) / 6. We can simplify that to (7*3^{n-1}) / 2, because 3^n / 6 = 3^{n}/(3*2) = 3^{n-1}/2. So, a_n = (7*3^{n-1}) / 2 + 1/2. Combining the terms, we can write it as a_n = (7*3^{n-1} + 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (7*3^{0} + 1)/2 = (7*1 + 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (7*3^{1} + 1)/2 = (21 + 1)/2 = 22/2 = 11 Wait, but earlier I had a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in my formula? Let me double-check the recurrence solution. The standard solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is indeed a_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c - 1). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the general form. Let me derive it properly.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the correct general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let's see:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it, which confirms the result.\n\nI think this thorough step-by-step approach, both manually computing each layer and then deriving a general formula, gives me confidence that the answer is correct. It's easy to make arithmetic mistakes when dealing with large numbers, so having two different methods leading to the same result is reassuring.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Started by recognizing the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Calculated each layer step by step, verifying each result as I went.\n3. Noticed a pattern that could be modeled as a recurrence relation.\n4. Solved the recurrence relation to find a general formula for the nth layer.\n5. Applied the formula to compute the outermost layer and then multiplied by 3 as per the original expression.\n6. Cross-verified using the general formula to ensure consistency.\n\nThis systematic approach helps minimize errors and ensures that I haven't missed any steps. It's a good practice, especially when dealing with repetitive or nested structures, to look for patterns that can be generalized or for which a formula can be derived. It saves time and reduces the chance of mistakes when dealing with complex expressions.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully working through each step and verifying my results, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - Final Calculation: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\boxed{88572}"

So the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but since it's only 9 layers, computing step by step is manageable. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me check a couple of layers again.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 360+3=363. 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, multiplying 29524 by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute it another way. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern of 1 plus three times the previous layer. After calculating each layer up to the ninth one, we get 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) and see if I get the same result using my method.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute it step by step as per the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, expanding the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my method works for a smaller version, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let's consider that each layer is defined by a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me see. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I double-checked each step, even derived a general formula to confirm the result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each time computing the value step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach, each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading to the final result after nine layers, multiplied by 3.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524, which we computed as 88572. Let me confirm that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nAnother way: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo,\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(...)\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So, each layer is inside the previous one. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because the innermost is the 9th layer, and then the outermost is 3 times that. So, yes, 9 layers, each time wrapping around. So, my earlier computation was correct, going up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3\" before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which would indicate the number of layers. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", meaning 9 layers. Therefore, my earlier approach of computing 9 layers is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute this step by step.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it manually:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 12))\n\n= 3(1 + 3*13)\n\n= 3(1 + 39)\n\n= 3*40 = 120\n\nWhich matches our earlier method.\n\nSo, applying the same method to the original problem, we get 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.

Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that checks out. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, step-by-step computation is manageable. I don't see any immediate mathematical formula that applies here, like a geometric series or something, because each term is built upon the previous one with a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's more of a recursive computation.

Ten-thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88572, but let me check using another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Because if I messed up any layer, the entire result would be wrong.\n\nStarting again, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step might be more straightforward.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me represent each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive expression. Let me think. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, we also arrive at the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9.

Wait, but let me check that again. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88,572. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as 29,524 + 29,524 + 29,524. Let me add them: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 + 29,524: 59,048 + 20,000 = 79,048. 79,048 + 9,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another condition to find A and B. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, from equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524=88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the formula for L_n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, 3^{11}=177,147. Then, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, using the closed-form formula also gives me 88,572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. I think I've covered all the steps, both by computing each layer manually and by finding a general formula for the layers. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I feel pretty sure that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct).

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this without recognizing the pattern, but since the pattern is clear, it's more efficient to use the formula. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here. Hmm, the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Wait, actually, let me think about it differently. Let me denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 is the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of each a_i as following the recurrence relation a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear equation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_i. The recurrence is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^i. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_i = A*3^i - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. So, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with a_1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct. I think that's it. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Another way to approach this is to recognize the pattern. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n without computing each layer. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3 =88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we compute each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to just compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (as calculated earlier). Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 8*3=24 +2=26, write down 6, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model it as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression. Let's see. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 ... and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9 and then multiplying by 3. Now, looking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I'm just starting out, breaking it down step by step was a good approach. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.
