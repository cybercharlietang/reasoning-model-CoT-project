    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. There are no more digits, so the final result is 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's a linear recurrence. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence relation, the closed-form solution would be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for Layer 9, n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Okay, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I computed Layer 9 correctly because if that's off, everything else will be wrong. Let me retrace my steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a - 1)), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nSo, plugging in a = 3, b = 1: L_n = C*3^n + (1/(3 - 1)) = C*3^n + 1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3C + 0.5 => 3C = 3.5 => C = 3.5 / 3 = 7/6.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as L_n = (7*3^n + 3)/6, since 1/2 is 3/6.\n\nWait, let me check that: (7/6)*3^n + 1/2 = (7*3^n)/6 + 3/6 = (7*3^n + 3)/6. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, L_9 would be (7*3^9 + 3)/6.\n\nLet me compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683.\n\nNow, L_9 = (7*19683 + 3)/6.\n\nCompute 7*19683: Let's compute that.\n\n19683 * 7:\n\n3*7=21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n8*7=56 + 2=58, write down 8, carry over 5.\n\n6*7=42 +5=47, write down 7, carry over 4.\n\n9*7=63 +4=67, write down 7, carry over 6.\n\n1*7=7 +6=13, write down 13.\n\nSo, 19683 * 7 = 137,781.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n19683\n\u00d7     7\n--------\n3*7=21 \u2192 1, carry 2\n8*7=56 +2=58 \u2192 8, carry 5\n6*7=42 +5=47 \u21927, carry4\n9*7=63 +4=67 \u21927, carry6\n1*7=7 +6=13 \u219213.\n\nSo, it's 137,781.\n\nThen, add 3: 137,781 + 3 = 137,784.\n\nNow, divide by 6: 137,784 \u00f7 6.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n6 into 13 is 2, remainder 1.\n\nBring down 7: 17. 6 into 17 is 2, remainder 5.\n\nBring down 7: 57. 6 into 57 is 9, remainder 3.\n\nBring down 8: 38. 6 into 38 is 6, remainder 2.\n\nBring down 4: 24. 6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0.\n\nSo, the result is 22,964.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier, when computing step by step, Layer 9 was 29,524, and now using the formula, I'm getting 22,964. That's a discrepancy. So, something's wrong here. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine the recurrence.\n\nI said L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is indeed L_n = C*a^n + b/(a - 1).\n\nSo, with a=3, b=1, the solution should be L_n = C*3^n + 1/(3-1) = C*3^n + 1/2.\n\nThen, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C + 0.5 \u2192 3C = 3.5 \u2192 C = 3.5/3 = 7/6.\n\nSo, L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2.\n\nNow, for n=9, L_9 = (7/6)*3^9 + 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^9 = 19,683.\n\nSo, (7/6)*19,683 = (7*19,683)/6.\n\nCompute 7*19,683:\n\n19,683 * 7:\n\n3*7=21 \u2192 write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n8*7=56 +2=58 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 5.\n\n6*7=42 +5=47 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 4.\n\n9*7=63 +4=67 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 6.\n\n1*7=7 +6=13 \u2192 write down 13.\n\nSo, 19,683 *7=137,781.\n\nNow, 137,781 \u00f76=?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 into 13 is 2, remainder 1.\n\nBring down 7: 17. 6 into 17 is 2, remainder 5.\n\nBring down 7: 57. 6 into 57 is 9, remainder 3.\n\nBring down 8: 38. 6 into 38 is 6, remainder 2.\n\nBring down 4: 24. 6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0.\n\nSo, the result is 22,964.\n\nThen, add 1/2: 22,964 + 0.5 = 22,964.5.\n\nWait, that's a fraction, but earlier, when I computed step by step, Layer 9 was an integer: 29,524.\n\nSo, there's a contradiction here. That means I must have made a mistake in the formula approach. Let me check my recurrence again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula because the initial condition is at n=1, but the formula might require n=0 or something else. Let me think.\n\nWait, the standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous solution is C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant if b is a constant. So, the particular solution is b/(a -1). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + b/(a -1).\n\nBut in our case, the initial condition is at n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, plugging n=1: L_1 = C*a^1 + b/(a -1) = C*3 + 1/(3 -1) = 3C + 0.5 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 3.5 \u2192 C=3.5/3=7/6, which is correct.\n\nThus, L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (7/6)*3^9 + 1/2 = (7*19,683)/6 + 0.5.\n\nAs before, that's 137,781/6 + 0.5 = 22,963.5 + 0.5 = 22,964.\n\nBut when I computed step by step, I got 29,524. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me check that again.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, according to step-by-step computation, L_9=29,524.\n\nBut according to the formula, L_9=22,964.\n\nThere's a discrepancy. So, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for n starting at 0, not at 1. Let me check that.\n\nIf n=0, then L_0 would be 1 + 3*L_{-1}, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the formula is applicable for n \u22651.\n\nWait, let me try plugging n=1 into the formula: L_1 = (7/6)*3^1 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 3/6 = 66/6=11. But according to step-by-step, L_2=13. Wait, that's not matching. So, something's wrong.\n\nWait, this suggests that the formula is not giving the correct result for n=2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula approach.\n\nWait, let's solve the recurrence relation again.\n\nGiven L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n -3L_{n-1}=0, characteristic equation r-3=0 \u2192 r=3. So, homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 \u2192 K -3K =1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 0.5 \u2192 3C =4 +0.5=4.5 \u2192 C=4.5/3=1.5=3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nAh, that seems better. Let me test this formula.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nAh, so the correct formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier when I derived the formula as (7/6)*3^n +1/2, which didn't match the step-by-step results. So, the correct formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches the step-by-step computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried using the formula with C=7/6, I got a different result, which was wrong. So, I must have made a mistake in that approach. The correct formula is L_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, which gives the right results.\n\nSo, to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, multiplying by 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute this again more carefully.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down digit by digit:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n- The digits before that are zeros, so we're done.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this multiplication another way. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 30000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, after verifying with the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered both computing each layer step by step and finding a pattern or formula to compute it more efficiently. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we can compute the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Recognizing the pattern, the nth layer can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   For n=9:\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. Hmm, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\n3 * 3 = 9, write 9.\n\nSo, writing from the last step: 9, then 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off. Wait, no, when you write the digits from right to left, you end up with 88572. Let me do it another way: 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\n3 * 3 = 9, write 9.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the units digit: 2,7,5,7,7,8,9. So, the number is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me compute Layer 9 again. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841: 9841 * 3.\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nWait, but 9841 is a 4-digit number, so:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut wait, there's no more digits, so carry 2 would be 2.\n\nSo, 9841 *3= 29523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, so I can verify my answer another way.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, if I consider each layer as a term in a sequence, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. But in our case, we started with a_1=1+3=4, then a_2=1 +3*4=13, etc. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1. So, the outermost layer would be n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I think the recurrence approach is solid.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match my earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by solving the recurrence relation. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

Wait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. But 29524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88,572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count them:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, which is the outermost one. So, yes, 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Next digit: 3 * 3 = 9. So, writing it out: 3 9 8 7 5 2. Wait, that would be 98752? Wait, no, I think I messed up the placement.

Since there are no more digits, we just write the carry if any, but here it's 0. So the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers, just to cross-verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because there are nine sets of parentheses inside the first 3(...).

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer.

So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nHow many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the first 3(...). Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3(...), there are 8 more layers, because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer.

Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the first layer is 3(...), then inside that, we have 1 + 3(...), which is the second layer.

Wait, no, that can't be because the original expression only has 9 layers inside the first 3(...). Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" inside the first 3(...):\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(...), the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we go out, it's another 1 + 3*(...).

So, the first 3(...) would be 3*(Layer 9). So, in my earlier computation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that the number of layers is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the expression has 8 layers inside the first 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the first 3(...). Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3(...), there are 8 more layers, each starting with \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, that would mean that the innermost layer is Layer 9, and then the first 3(...) is Layer 10. But in my earlier computation, I only went up to Layer 9, which would be inside the first 3(...). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the layer count. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me consider the structure:\n\n- The entire expression is 3*(...). So, that's the outermost layer.\n\nInside that, we have 1 + 3*(...), which is the next layer.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until we reach the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, starting from the outermost:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 10)\n\nWait, but the innermost is Layer 10: 1 + 3.\n\nWait, that can't be, because the innermost is just 1 + 3, so maybe the layers are labeled from the innermost outward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as a depth of 9 layers inside the first 3(...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), inside that, it's 1 + 3(...). Then, inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3(...), there are 8 more \"1 + 3(\" expressions. Wait, that would mean that the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers inside the first 3(...) is 8, making the total layers from innermost to outermost as 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, ensuring that I don't miscount.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the first 3(...) was Layer 1, but in this computation, Layer 9 is the innermost. So, the structure is:\n\n3*(Layer 9)\n\nWhere Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nAnd so on down to Layer 1, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I was mislabeling the layers earlier. So, in this case, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, no, the expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 9. So, the layers are:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, in that case, my computation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check my layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: is the original expression 3*(Layer 9), or is Layer 9 the outermost expression? Let me look again at the original problem:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer wraps that with 1 + 3*(...), and the outermost is 3*(...). So, yes, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's take a simpler version with fewer layers. For example, let's compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That's three layers inside. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute it as per my method:\n\nLayer 1: 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nWhich is correct because 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40? Wait, wait, that doesn't match. Wait, no: Wait, in the smaller example, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), so innermost is 1+3=4. Then next layer is 1 + 3*4=13. Then outermost is 1 + 3*13=40, but wait, no: Wait, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, no, in the smaller example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, innermost is 1+3=4. Then next layer is 1 + 3*4=13. Then outermost is 3*(1 + 3*13)=3*(1 + 39)=3*40=120.\n\nWait, but when I computed it step by step, I thought it was 39, but that's incorrect. Let me clarify: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so in my earlier approach, I had layers labeled as 1 to 3, with Layer 3 being 1 + 3*(Layer 2). But in this smaller example, the outermost is 3*(Layer 3), which is 3*(40) = 120.\n\nWait, so in my original problem, I had 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(...), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, in the smaller example, it's 3*(Layer 3), which is correct. So, in the original problem, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, if I follow the same approach as before, I get 3*(Layer 3)=120, which is correct. So, my approach seems valid.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = C*3^{n} + D,\n\nwhere C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I've arrived at the right answer by both iterative computation and by solving the recurrence relation. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2.

Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication with another method to be sure. 29524 \u00d7 3 can be calculated as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple layers. Let me list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about this expression: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n... and so on.\n\nI notice that each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that. Wait, more accurately, for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + b, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + b*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). In our case, k is 3 and b is 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, not a_0. Let me adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 as the innermost value before any layers, which would be 1, I think. Wait, no, because the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, perhaps a_0 is undefined, and our recurrence starts at a_1. Alternatively, maybe I can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each a_n step by step since there are only nine layers, which isn't too bad. But maybe recognizing the pattern can help confirm the result.\n\nLooking at the a_n values I computed:\n\na1 = 4\na2 = 13\na3 = 40\na4 = 121\na5 = 364\na6 = 1093\na7 = 3280\na8 = 9841\na9 = 29524\n\nI notice that each a_n is 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, each term is three times the previous plus one. Let me check if these numbers match known sequences or if they have a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That matches a1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. That matches a2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nWow, that's a neat pattern! So, each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify using a different method or recognizing a pattern. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093 *3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding each step is manageable.\n\nAnother approach might be to recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's a recursive computation, which is exactly what I did.\n\nAlternatively, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to a_9. Then the final result is 3*a_9. So, yeah, that's the same as what I did.\n\nI think I did everything correctly. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use that result in the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process, each time plugging the result into the next outer layer.\n4. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply by 3.\n\nEach step seems to check out, so I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result in the next layer: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n4. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3: 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

Let me see:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there's 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on, until the last one, which is 1+3). So how many layers? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the outermost.\n\nWait, the original expression has 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of closing parentheses. Each layer ends with a ), so let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses from the innermost:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then another (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each time you have a 1+3(, which is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So if I have n layers, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So in this case, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nAfter 3(, the next is (1+3(, which is layer 1.\n\nThen another (1+3(, which is layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the last one, which is (1+3).\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of layers is 9 because each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and the innermost is just 1+3 without another layer. Wait, no, because each time you have \"1+3(\", it's a new layer. So let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the first one after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", which would imply 9 layers. But wait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, which doesn't have another \"1+3(\", so maybe there are 8 layers? Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list each layer as I computed before:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 88,572.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, each computed correctly.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a*r^n + b.\n\nLet me try to find a solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. To be thorough, I can check one more layer using the formula.\n\nFor example, n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nSo, the formula is correct, and the step-by-step computation is accurate.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed using the formula \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( L_1 = 4 \\).

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it down step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9. Write down 9.\n\nWait, but 29524 has 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\nBut wait, the 2 is in the ten thousands place, so after that, there's no more digits, so we just write down 8.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo the result is 88,572. Yes, that makes sense because 30,000 \u00d7 3 is 90,000, and 29,524 is slightly less than 30,000, so 88,572 seems reasonable.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because one mistake can throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I labeled the layers, I might have miscounted. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, given the repetitive structure. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n = 9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and the number of such layers is 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, using the formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nThus, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, leading to a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nEach L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nIf I expand this, L_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this way, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*L_1.\n\nBut since L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, perhaps that's where the geometric series comes from.\n\nWait, actually, the sum 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} is a geometric series with sum (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be expanded as L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*L_1.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me try to express L_n in terms of L_1.\n\nFrom L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\n\nSimilarly, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*L_{n-3}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_{n-3}\n\nContinuing this, after n-1 steps, we get:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*L_1.\n\nSince L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, we can plug that in:\n\nL_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n*(1 + 3) = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n*4.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem to align with our earlier formula. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, since we've already derived that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which works for n >=1, as we saw with n=1: L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute Layer 9 again step by step without the formula:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3:  \n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572  \n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x       3\n   ------------\n     8 7 7 5 2\n\nWait, that would be 87752, but that's not correct because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the digits. Let me do it more carefully:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 7, 7, 8. Wait, that would be 877572, but that's six digits. Wait, 29524 is a five-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a five or six-digit number. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000\n3*9000 = 27000\n3*500 = 1500\n3*20 = 60\n3*4 = 12\nNow, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Ah, there we go. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. I must have made a mistake earlier when I was trying to compute it digit by digit. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote the nth term as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is layer 9, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me check that: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula. It's interesting how the recurrence relation helps in solving this without having to compute each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know the general approach in case the number of layers increases. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer starting from the innermost, I was able to find the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allowed me to find a closed-form solution, which can be more efficient for larger numbers of layers. Either way, the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my multiplication again because that feels too high. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,7,7,8,5,8,8. Wait, that can't be right because that would give 88572. But 29524 * 3 is actually 88572, right? Let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because 88572 seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is when we set a_n = 3a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, all the steps check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we find the value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct, and then 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssume a_p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSo, 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. In this case, deriving the closed-form formula using the recurrence relation helped solidify that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the expression can be expanded as a sum of 3^k terms. However, since each layer adds a 1, it's a bit more involved, but the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the value of the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the multiplication should give a 6-digit number? Wait, no, 29524 * 3 is 88572, because 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

Each layer builds upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like each time, you're doing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a geometric progression or something similar? Wait, maybe I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, and a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a nonhomogeneous one because of the constant term 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's say n = 4: a_4 should be 121. Using the formula: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Yep, that's correct. Similarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which also matches. So, the formula seems to be working. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any addition errors in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost nine layers, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the result of the ninth layer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check:\n\n9841 \u00d7 3:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 5, carry 2\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 9, carry 2\nBut since we're at the thousands place, the carryover 2 becomes 2000, so the total is 29523. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by computing each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each step follows logically, and the multiplication checks out when verified by adding 29524 three times.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward and verifying each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 3*3=9. So, writing from right to left: 2,7,5,7,8,9. So, 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. I started from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, leading to a geometric progression. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me explore that approach to verify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the closed-form formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression up to nine layers is a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods, the iterative step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, lead to the same result. I think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both approaches align.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, it's 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me double-check each layer because if any layer is wrong, the whole answer will be off. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me confirm the multiplication once more. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Alternatively, I can compute it as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions, especially with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or make an arithmetic mistake. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3. Alternatively, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we did before. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a term in the sequence defined by a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and since we have 9 layers, it's a_9, and then multiplied by 3. This method is more efficient and less error-prone than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. However, since we only have 9 layers, both methods work. I think I'm confident now that the answer is correct. Just to recap: 1. Start from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). 3. Compute each layer up to the 9th layer, resulting in 29524. 4. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88572. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation formula, we find that a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using the recurrence relation method, we find the ninth term and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - Final Answer: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1: 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, expanding it, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3*3*3*...*3*1, with each term having one more 3 than the previous. But actually, since it's nested, the number of terms would correspond to the number of layers. Wait, but maybe that's complicating it. The recurrence approach worked well, so perhaps it's best to stick with that. Alternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n=9, so a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's another way to approach it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's assume a_n = A + B*3^n. Plugging into the recurrence: A + B*3^n = 1 + 3*(A + B*3^{n-1}) = 1 + 3A + B*3^n. So, equate both sides: A + B*3^n = 1 + 3A + B*3^n. Subtract B*3^n from both sides: A = 1 + 3A. Then, A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = -1/2 + B*3^n. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = -1/2 + B*3^1 => 4 = -1/2 + 3B => 3B = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => B = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = -1/2 + (3/2)*3^n = -1/2 + (3^{n+1})/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result.

Let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost term and working layer by layer, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's value by 3. The detailed computation confirms that the final value is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1, next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, next: 5*3=15, carryover 1, next: 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, next: 2*3=6 +2=8, and the last digit: 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check with another method. 29,524 * 3: 30,000 *3 = 90,000, minus (476*3). Wait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 29,524 *3: 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me go back a bit. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then I multiplied that by 3 to get 88,572. But let me double-check the computations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic when doing it step by step. Let me recast the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that looks correct. Each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1. So, each layer n is 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, that seems correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... ))) So, does that mean that Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3? Yes, because the outermost operation is 3*(...), where ... is the entire nested expression, which evaluates to Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous with constant coefficients. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\nL(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous part is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L(n) = (3^(n+1)-1)/2, then 3*L(n) = 3*(3^(n+1)-1)/2 = (3^(n+2) -3)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=9, so 3*L(9) = (3^(11) -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*L(9) = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to compute it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, derived a closed-form formula, and confirmed the result using two different methods. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again because I might have messed up the steps. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry over 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\nThere's no more digits, so write the carry over if any, but here it's done.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, I think that was correct because each layer was built on the previous one. Let me verify the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572. Wait, but when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I got 88572, but when I computed each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Let me see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), each time there's a new opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of times 3(1 + 3(...) occurs. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)\n\nAnd so on until Layer9, which is the outermost. So, yes, 9 layers. So when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, that's correct, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), so 3*29524=88572. But wait, when I computed Layer9 as 29524, that was the value inside the outermost parentheses, so the total expression is 3 times that. So yes, 88572 should be the answer. Wait, but let me check my multiplication again because 29524*3=88572. Let me compute 29524*3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStart from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927\n9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover 2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count too many.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) =1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B +1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B +1\n\nThen, -2B =1 \u2192 B= -1/2\n\nSo, a_n = A*3^n -1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4\n\nSo, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer1: n=1, a1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: n=2, a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: n=3, a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer9: n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula.\n\nGiven that a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to compute this without expanding each layer, using the formula.\n\nBut since I already did it step by step and confirmed with the formula, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nSo, the problem is solved, and the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). The innermost term is 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Starting from the right: 8 +4=12, write 2, carryover 1. 4 +2=6 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8. 2 +0=2. So, 88572. Okay, that checks out. So the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. I counted 9 layers, but let me see: Each time, we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me parse the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...). Each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...). From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3 around it. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on, up to 9 layers. So, yes, 9 layers. So, Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify the multiplication step by step. Alternatively, I can do it as 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.

So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, all layers are correct up to Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Let me confirm the structure again. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, yes, it's 3 times the result of Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute the layers again in a different way or check for any possible arithmetic errors. Let me compute Layer 9 again: Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct).

Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.

So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nSo, writing from top to bottom: 6, 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me write it out vertically:\n\n   29524\nx     3\n--------\n   ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no, I think I messed up the order. Let me do it more carefully:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (from the last digit), then 8, then 7, then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that would be 88,7572? That can't be right. Wait, no, the digits are written from right to left, so the first digit we wrote is the units place, then tens, hundreds, etc. So, the correct order is 88,572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just double-check all the layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps.

Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, all these steps check out. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make it quicker. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me think about solving this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we need a_9, because the innermost is a_1, and each layer out is a_2, ..., up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, 88,572.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, for n=0, if we consider a_0, it would be 1 (since a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => a_0 = 1). So, a_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. Now we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) A + B = 1 Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from equation 2: (3/2) + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which is correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3 times the previous value. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But I want to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLet me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches Layer 1. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a_1=4; n=2, a_2=13; n=3, a_3=40; etc., which matches the layers I computed earlier. So, in general, this is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + 0 = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we also arrive at the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, it's equivalent to 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the ninth term in the sequence defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1=4. So, using the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we can compute a_9 and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nThis seems like a solid approach, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation formula\u2014lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let me compute 3*(29524) once more:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, checked my work using two different methods, and both lead to the same conclusion. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's add them up:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\nThen, 59048 + 29524:\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a bit. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me confirm that each layer was computed correctly because if I messed up one layer, the rest would be wrong.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct up to Layer 9. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire original expression in terms of the closed-form formula.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it directly without going through each layer, which is much faster. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. To recap, I broke down the problem by computing each nested layer step by step, verified each computation, then recognized a pattern allowing me to use a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula to compute the result more efficiently. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing a repeating pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, leading to the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer. The relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The solution to the recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**: Since there are 9 layers, compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
