    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Wait, that seems too long. Maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. So, reading from top to bottom: 7 7 8 5 7 2, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me go back to the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 (correct). Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 (correct). Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 (correct). Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct). Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct). Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct). Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct). Then 3*29524=88572 (correct). Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me model it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, that seems correct. I think I've arrived at the correct answer by both iterative computation and by finding a closed-form formula. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, which might form a different kind of series. Let me see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence might give me a formula for a_n, which could make the computation easier, especially if there are many layers. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that approach. Given a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since our expression has 9 layers, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, whether I compute it layer by layer or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6, 3*3=9. Wait, no, that's too many digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2,9,5,2,4. So, multiplying each digit by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 3*3=9.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3 times that: 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each layer manually isn't too bad. It's a bit tedious, but manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers. Looking at the results: Layer 1: 4 = 4 Layer 2: 13 = 4*3 +1 Layer 3: 40 = 13*3 +1 Layer 4: 121 = 40*3 +1 Layer 5: 364 = 121*3 +1 Layer 6: 1093 = 364*3 +1 Layer 7: 3280 = 1093*3 +1 Layer 8: 9841 = 3280*3 +1 Layer 9: 29524 = 9841*3 +1 So each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That's a recurrence relation. So, if I let a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 3*4 +1=13, a_3=3*13+1=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula for a_n, but since n=9 is small, it's easier to compute step by step. But for understanding, let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula also leads to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the final result by 3.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7.

Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me verify that each layer was computed correctly. Let's go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

So, each layer is correct. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach would work. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as S. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Wait, but that might not be the standard way to represent it. Alternatively, maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can compute each layer step by step.

Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, that's correct. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 1 + 3*4=13, correct. And so on up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Let me verify one of the layers to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121, so Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, plus 3*1=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Wait, no, 3280 is 3000 + 200 + 80. So, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, all layers are computed correctly. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern that could simplify the computation. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^(p) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute the value step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series. Let me see if that's applicable here.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive formula where each term depends on the previous term. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and r=3. The solution to this recurrence is L_n = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1) + L_0*(r^{n-1}), but since L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, maybe L_0 would be 1? Wait, let me think carefully.\n\nActually, the standard solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = (a/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1). Let me verify that. For n=1, L1 = (1/(3-1))*(3^1 -1) = (1/2)*(3 -1) = (1/2)*2 = 1. But our L1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. To be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81, 81*3=243, 243*3=729, 729*3=2187, 2187*3=6561, 6561*3=19683, 19683*3=59049. Yes, correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly. Let me go back and verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but given the time, I think the step-by-step approach worked. I don't recall a specific formula for this, but it's similar to a geometric series or something, but maybe not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recursive formula: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression saved me from computing each layer manually, which is more efficient and less error-prone. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we can compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n- \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, 29524 *2=59048, so 29524*3=59048 +29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88752. So I must have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do it more carefully.\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3 step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12. Write 2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit: 2 *3=6 +1=7. Write7.\n\nNext digit:5 *3=15. Write5, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:9 *3=27 +1=28. Write8, carryover2.\n\nNext digit:2 *3=6 +2=8. Write8.\n\nSo the result is 8 (from the ten thousands place), then 8 (thousands), then 7 (hundreds), then 5 (tens), then 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88752, but when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572, which is different. So there's a mistake here. Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, maybe I misaligned the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x         3\n   ------------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12. Write down 2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +1=7.

So I must have made a mistake in my multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the digit positions.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\n2 (ten thousands)\n\n9 (thousands)\n\n5 (hundreds)\n\n2 (tens)\n\n4 (units)\n\nSo when multiplying by 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover1.\n\n2 (tens)*3=6 +1=7, write7.\n\n5 (hundreds)*3=15, write5, carryover1.\n\n9 (thousands)*3=27 +1=28, write8, carryover2.\n\n2 (ten thousands)*3=6 +2=8, write8.\n\nSo the product is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). So 88752.\n\nBut when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572, which is different. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition method. Let me check 29524 *3 again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nCompute 29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n500 *3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nSo the correct product is 88572, not 88752. So where did I go wrong in the multiplication?\n\nAh, I see. When I did the multiplication step by step, I wrote down the digits as 8 8 7 5 2, which is 88752, but that's incorrect because the carryover from the thousands place should affect the ten thousands place correctly.\n\nWait, let me try again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write7.\n\n5*3=15, write5, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write8, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write8.\n\nSo the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). But when adding, I get 88572, which is different. So perhaps the way I'm writing the digits is wrong. Wait, the first digit from the right is units, then tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands. So when I write the product, it should be 88572, not 88752. So perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I multiply each digit, I should write the digits in the correct place. So:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2 in units, carryover1.\n\nNext digit (tens):2*3=6 +1=7. Write7 in tens.\n\nNext digit (hundreds):5*3=15. Write5 in hundreds, carryover1.\n\nNext digit (thousands):9*3=27 +1=28. Write8 in thousands, carryover2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands):2*3=6 +2=8. Write8 in ten thousands.\n\nSo the product is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88752, but when adding, it's 88572. So there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the way I'm writing the digits is reversed.\n\nWait, maybe I'm writing the digits from left to right as ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units, but when I do the multiplication, the carryover affects the next higher digit, so the way I write the digits should be correct. But the addition shows it's 88572, which is different. So perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just accept that 29524*3=88572 as per the addition method, which is accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial computation of the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nWait, so Layer9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer9 as 29524, then 3*29524=88572, which matches the addition method. So where did I go wrong in the initial multiplication? I think I made a mistake in the way I wrote down the digits. The correct product is 88572, not 88752. So perhaps I miscounted the digits when writing them down.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the multiplication step by step, I thought it was 88752, but that was incorrect. The correct product is 88572.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me compute 29524 *3 using another method. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 *3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 +9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3\n\n=60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the step-by-step multiplication, I thought it was 88752, but that was a mistake. So the correct answer is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern:\n\na1=4\n\na2=1+3*4=13\n\na3=1+3*13=40\n\na4=1+3*40=121\n\na5=1+3*121=364\n\na6=1+3*364=1093\n\na7=1+3*1093=3280\n\na8=1+3*3280=9841\n\na9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, yeah, that's exactly what I did before. So, the nth term is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for layer 9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572? Let me check using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again: 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct.

Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\nNo more digits, but we have a carryover: 0 * 3 + 2 = 2. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the digits are 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, maybe I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    *       3\n    -----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7. Write 7.\n5 *3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n9 *3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n2 *3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\nSo the result is 88572. So yes, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it digit by digit earlier, I thought I had 88572, so that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me go back to the layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, you can make a mistake in one of the earlier layers, which propagates through.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent each time I compute it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nGiven that, starting from L_1 = 1 +3=4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut since L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can solve it as follows.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\).

Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but I just realized that the original expression has 9 layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I computed Layer 1 as 1 + 3, that's correct. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate.\n\nLet me verify each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), it's feasible to compute each step. I wonder if there's a recursive formula here. Let's think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I can directly compute a_9 without having to compute each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, both methods work. It's good to know both ways, though. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1 + 3. By solving the recurrence relation, I found that each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that gives a_9=29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the inner expression. By solving the recurrence relation, each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is following a geometric sequence or some pattern that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. If I expand this, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to write out the expansion. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). But that's the same as the original problem. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as adding another term. Wait, perhaps another way: each time, the expression is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, if I have n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we saw earlier. Since we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{next layer}\\).

But wait, the problem is written as 3(1 + 3(...)) with nine layers. Let me count the number of layers to make sure I didn't miss any. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each additional layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each time, it's 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of times 1 + 3 appears:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to nine layers. So yes, I computed nine layers, each time adding another 3(...).

Let me verify that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me recompute Layer 9 step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about the recurrence relation. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, using the recurrence relation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand all the layers, it might form a geometric series. Let me try that. Let me write out the entire expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) =1 +12=13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13)=1+39=40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(40)=1 +120=121.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(121)=1+363=364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(364)=1 +1092=1093.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1093)=1 +3279=3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(3280)=1 +9840=9841.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(9841)=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me think about it. Each time we have a term that is 3 times something, which itself contains another 3 times something, etc. So, maybe the entire expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I expand this, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to a certain power, depending on how many layers it's nested. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) =1 +12=13.\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 +3 +9=13.\n\nWait, that's 1 +3 +9=13.\n\nSimilarly, the next layer:1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40.\n\nWhich is 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27=40.\n\nWait, so each time, we're adding another power of 3. Let me see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4=1 +3\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(Layer1)=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)=1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1 +3*(1 +3 +9 +27)=1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121\n\nWait a minute, I see a pattern here. Each layer n adds 3^{n+1}.\n\nSo, for Layer1: 3^1 +1=4\n\nLayer2:3^1 +3^2 +1=13\n\nLayer3:3^1 +3^2 +3^3 +1=40\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at Layer2:1 +3 +9=13, which is 1 +3^1 +3^2.\n\nSimilarly, Layer3:1 +3 +9 +27=40=1 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3.\n\nSo, each Layer n is equal to 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier computation, Layer1 was 4, which is 1 +3=1 +3^1.\n\nLayer2 was 1 +3 +9=1 +3^1 +3^2.\n\nLayer3 was 1 +3 +9 +27=1 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3.\n\nSo, indeed, Layer n is equal to 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k.\n\nBut wait, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer9 would be 1 + sum_{k=1}^{9} 3^k.\n\nBut in our earlier computation, Layer9 was 29524, which we found to be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's see: sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k is a geometric series with ratio 3, first term 3, number of terms n.\n\nThe sum is 3*(3^{n} -1)/(3 -1)= (3^{n+1} -3)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k =1 + (3^{n+1} -3)/2= (2 +3^{n+1} -3)/2=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWhich matches our earlier formula for a_n.\n\nTherefore, Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by coefficients.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4=3 +1.\n\nLayer2:1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13=1 +3 +9.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40=1 +3 +9 +27.\n\nSo, each layer adds another term which is 3 times the previous layer, which itself includes all the previous terms.\n\nSo, when we expand the entire expression, it's like adding up all the powers of 3 up to 3^9, and then multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...+3*(1 +3)...))).\n\nIf we expand this, it's 3*1 +3^2*1 +3^3*1 +...+3^9*1 +3^{10}*1.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, let me try to expand the entire expression.\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))}.\n\nLet me try to expand this step by step.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is 1 +3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 +3*4=13.\n\nThen, 1 +3*13=40.\n\nThen, 1 +3*40=121.\n\nThen, 1 +3*121=364.\n\nThen, 1 +3*364=1093.\n\nThen, 1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nThen, 1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nThen, 1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent E as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nEach time, when I expand a layer, it's equivalent to adding another power of 3.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3=4=1 +3.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13.\n\nThen, next is 1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27=40.\n\nSo, each layer adds another 3^k term.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression would be 1 + sum_{k=1}^{9}3^k.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost expression is 1 +3, which is 1 +3^1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=1 +3^1 +3^2.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27=1 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3.\n\nSo, each layer adds another power of 3.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer9, would be 1 + sum_{k=1}^{9}3^k.\n\nBut wait, in our computation earlier, Layer9 was 29524, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nSo, 1 + sum_{k=1}^{9}3^k= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression E=3*(1 + sum_{k=1}^{9}3^k)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, E=(3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me verify the multiplication once more. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute it digit by digit: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misaligned the digits earlier. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me count the digits properly. 29524 has 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, no carry.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 (from ten thousands), 8 (from thousands), 7 (from hundreds), 7 (from tens), 2 (from units). Wait, that would be 88772? But that's conflicting with the previous result. I must have made a mistake here. Let me do it step by step:\n\nLet's write it vertically:\n\n    2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7         3\n------------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. So, I think my earlier confusion was misplaced. So, the correct multiplication gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is built correctly upon the previous one, and the multiplication at the end is accurate. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me check a couple of the layers again.\n\nFor example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29524*3: as computed, 88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me see if I can model this problem that way.\n\nLet's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3a_8\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A * r^n + C\n\nwhere r is the common ratio, and C is a constant.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant C.\n\nTo find C, set a_n = C:\n\nC = 3C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form expression is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form expression:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I've got the correct answer here. To recap, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at 29524 for the innermost expression, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Additionally, using the recurrence relation approach, I derived a closed-form formula which also gave me 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute one of the layers again to check for arithmetic errors. Let's take Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. From earlier, Layer 6 was 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279, and 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSimilarly, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this multiplication again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlright, I think I've thoroughly checked my work. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations or reasoning. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value step by step.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or using a formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me see: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic root r=3. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + D. Now, to find D, we can plug into the nonhomogeneous equation: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we find that the value of the innermost expression grows exponentially. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost expression and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 0 * 3 = 0, but we're done. Wait, that seems messy. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 0*3=0. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\nNo more digits, so we're done.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting with my previous thought. Let me do it step by step:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Ten-thousands digit is 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 8 8 7 5 2. Wait, that would be 88752. But wait, 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 30000 * 3 = 90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit calculation. Let me try again carefully.\n\nBreaking down 29524:\n\n- 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nMultiply each by 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit approach? Let me try that again.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nDigit 1: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\nDigit 2: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\nDigit 3: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nDigit 4: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nDigit 5: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88752, but that contradicts the correct result of 88572. Hmm, so I must have misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm writing them in the wrong order. Let me write the digits as I compute them, from right to left:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units place: 2\n- Tens place: 7\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Thousands place: 8\n- Ten-thousands place: 8\n\nSo, writing them in order: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88752, which is incorrect because we know the correct answer is 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in the thousands place.\n\nWait, let's check the thousands place again. The digit is 9, which is in the thousands place. 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 from the hundreds place, which was 5*3=15, so carryover 1. So, 27 +1=28. So, we write down 8 and carryover 2 to the next higher place, which is the ten-thousands place.\n\nThe ten-thousands place is 2, so 2*3=6 plus carryover 2=8. So, that's correct. So, the digits are:\n\n- Units:2\n- Tens:7\n- Hundreds:5\n- Thousands:8\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, writing from left to right: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88752, but that's not matching the correct total. So, I must have messed up the digit positions. Alternatively, perhaps I should write the digits as I compute them, starting from the right, so the first digit computed is units, then tens, then hundreds, etc. So, the first digit is units:2, then tens:7, hundreds:5, thousands:8, ten-thousands:8. So, writing them in order: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88572, which is correct. So, I think I just misplaced the hundreds and tens digits earlier. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial digit-by-digit approach, I thought I was getting 88752, which was wrong, but upon rechecking, it's 88572. So, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me verify:\n\nWait, 29524:\n\n- Digit positions from right: 4 (units), 2 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 9 (thousands), 2 (ten-thousands).\n\nSo, when multiplying:\n\n- Units:4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens:2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the digits are, from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. But when written as a number, it's 88572, because the rightmost digit is units, so the order is:\n\n- Units:2\n- Tens:7\n- Hundreds:5\n- Thousands:8\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, writing from left to right: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I computed each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer again to check for any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 (correct)\n\nSo, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3:29524 *3=88572\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the value of each layer step by step. Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

I was worried at first that I might have missed a layer or miscalculated a multiplication, but going through each step carefully seems to have worked. I guess the key here was to recognize the pattern and compute each nested expression from the inside out. It's like peeling an onion; each layer reveals the next one, and you have to handle each part step by step. I didn't make any mistakes this time, I think. Each multiplication and addition was double-checked, and the final multiplication by 3 gave a reasonable number. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7, no carry.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, no carry.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, no carry.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Let me add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, when computing Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps because if I messed up one layer, the rest would be off.\n\nLet me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo each layer checks out. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or a formula. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe there's a geometric series or something. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, subtract 3B from both sides:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same final answer of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just multiply 29524 by 3 digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7. 5 *3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 0*3=0, but since there's a carryover? Wait, no, the number is 29524, which is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, actually, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 ones. So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. 0*3=0, but since there's a 2 carried over, wait no, after the first digit, we have 29524, so when we reach the end, we don't have more digits, so 2 is carried over to the next place, which is the ten thousands place. So, 2*3=6, but we have a carryover of 2, so 6+2=8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next digit: 0*3=0 +0=0, but since we're done, we don't write anything else. So putting it all together, starting from the right, we have 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, no, wait. Let me write it down properly:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place):\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place):\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place):\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place):\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSince there are no more digits, we don't have anything else to multiply, so the carryover stops here.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we have 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the product should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 is 29,524. Multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it as:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 *3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, that's 88,572, which is 88 thousand 572. But let me confirm by another method. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = 60,000 +27,000=87,000 +1,500=88,500 +60=88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me go back a step. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me make sure that my computation of Layer 9 was correct. Let's go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524=88,572. That seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step, writing each layer as I go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have nine layers, perhaps there's a geometric series or some recurrence relation we can use. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} =1, but actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3=3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1: n=1, a_1=4. The outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1=59,048. Divided by 2: 59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(29,524)=88,572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be computed as 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, 3^11=177,147. Then, 177,147 -3=177,144. Divided by 2: 177,144/2=88,572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Therefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^11 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. Yes, that's correct. Then, 177,147 -3=177,144. Divided by 2: 177,144/2=88,572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which can be seen as a geometric progression with ratio 3. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = a1*(r^n -1)/(r -1). But in this case, each term is 1, but the multiplication by 3 complicates things a bit. However, using the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the result of 88,572. Additionally, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I confirmed that the result is indeed 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

But since it's nested nine times, maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we did earlier. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on, up to a_9. Then E = 3*a_9. So, the value of a_n follows the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence. It's a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Therefore, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same result. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers to confirm. Wait, I already did all nine layers, so I think that's thorough enough. Alternatively, I can compute the entire expression using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

So 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight-hand side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88,572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, double-checked my work, and even found a formula to model the problem, which helped confirm my answer. It's a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down layer by layer and then verifying with a formula made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3 * 29524 should be 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6, 2*3=6. So writing it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next: 2*3=6, write 6. So the result is 88572. So, putting it all together, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify each step because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each layer is indeed growing by a factor of 3 each time plus 1. Is there a formula for such a recursive sequence? Let's see. If I have a recurrence relation where L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. We know that L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, if I plug in n=0, but since our sequence starts at n=1, maybe we need to adjust. Alternatively, let's consider the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L1=4= C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute each layer without having to manually calculate each one, which is much faster and reduces the chance of error. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can use the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, which is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Calculating up to the 9th layer gives us 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 6 0 0 0 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is 29,524.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 4, n2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, n3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It seems like each term is following a geometric progression or something similar. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see: Let me denote each layer as a_i, where i starts from 1. So, a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, a9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me see: The general form is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_i.\n\nThe recurrence is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^i.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_i = A*3^i + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier values:\n\nFor i=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor i=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor i=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor i=4: a4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, a_i = (3^{i+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1 =1 +3.\n\nThen, E2 =1 +3*E1 =1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13.\n\nE3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nE4=1 +3*E3=1 +120=121.\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1 +363=364.\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1 +1092=1093.\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1 +3279=3280.\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1 +9840=9841.\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer comes out to be 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 0 * 3 = 0. 0 * 3 = 0. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the breakdown. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Now, add 87000 + 1572: 87000 + 1000=88000, 88000 + 572=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Let's see. Let me denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3. Then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me try for n=1: a_1 = 4. If n=1, (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 =1. That's not 4. Hmm, maybe my formula is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different formula. Let me try to compute a few terms using the recurrence relation and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 =13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39=40\n\na_4=1+3a_3=1+120=121\n\na_5=1+3a_4=1+363=364\n\na_6=1+3a_5=1+1092=1093\n\na_7=1+3a_6=1+3279=3280\n\na_8=1+3a_7=1+9840=9841\n\na_9=1+3a_8=1+29523=29524\n\nWhich is what I did before. Now, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 =13\n\na_3=40\n\na_4=121\n\na_5=364\n\na_6=1093\n\na_7=3280\n\na_8=9841\n\na_9=29524\n\nHmm, let's see if these numbers follow a pattern. Let me see the ratio between successive terms.\n\n13/4=3.25\n\n40/13\u22483.077\n\n121/40\u22483.025\n\n364/121\u22483.008\n\n1093/364\u22483.000\n\nWait, so as n increases, the ratio approaches 3, which makes sense because each term is defined by a_n =1 +3a_{n-1}, so as n increases, a_n \u22483a_{n-1}, leading to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut for finite n, we have an exact formula. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r-3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K =1 + 3K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3=3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 holds for each n.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the innermost term. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

I think I'm making a mistake in the number of digits. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, the result should be up to 6 digits, but let me actually compute it correctly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\nNow, since there are no more digits, we have the carryover 2 to add.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times, which can be represented as 3*( (3^{9} -1)/2 ). Wait, no, because each layer adds another exponent. Let me think again. The general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, as we saw. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, I can compute it without going through each layer step by step. That might be faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Anyway, I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the formula for the general term of this recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term).

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that seems right. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see, solving this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, equating terms: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Let me check: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.

Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. If I let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the final result is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute a_1: a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, then the final answer is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177,147. So, (177,147 -3)/2 =177,144/2=88,572. Yes, that's the same answer. So, that's another way to approach it using the formula. But since I was able to compute it step by step as well, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Wait, wait, 29524 is 2,9,5,2,4. Let me write it as 2 9 5 2 4. Multiply each digit by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to verify. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524.\n\nCalculating 3 * 29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that when I was computing the layers, I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer1) is Layer 2.\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9.\n\nBut in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps another 1+3 around it. So, the total number of layers is 9, as I thought before.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method is correct. Let's say I have a simpler version with fewer layers. For example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOuter layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, computing directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)):\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work for smaller cases. Therefore, I can be confident that for the original problem, the answer is 88,572.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 would be 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\na3 =1 +3*a2=1+39=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a9.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a9.\n\nSo, we can model this as a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nComparing both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2.\n\nThen, using the initial condition a1=4.\n\na1= A*3^1 + B = 3A -1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, using the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which confirms that 88,572 is correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
