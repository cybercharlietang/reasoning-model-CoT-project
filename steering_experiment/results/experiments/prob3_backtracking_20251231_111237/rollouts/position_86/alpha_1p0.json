    "text": " Wait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080+12=1092, yes. So 1 + 1092=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Let me check if I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step because doing it manually for nine layers is time-consuming and error-prone. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers is larger. But since I only had nine layers, doing it step by step was manageable, although a bit tedious. I'm glad I checked the formula because it confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence can be found because it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Wait, actually, more accurately, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Let me recall: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144 /2 =88572. So, same result. That confirms it.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let's see. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). It looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in the problem, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, so maybe a_1 = 4, and each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's check: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for n=9, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or find the closed-form solution, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. Let me assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, let's use the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern in the layers: Each time, the value is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's like a geometric series. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, with nine 1s. Let me think about the sum. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum of a geometric series, but given the nesting, it's more of a recurrence. But since I've already computed it step by step and confirmed with the formula, I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

So, I think that's correct. Let me just check once more to be sure. Maybe I can use a different approach, like recognizing a pattern or using a formula for a geometric series. Wait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if this is a geometric sequence or can be expressed as such. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. On the other hand, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + D. So, setting them equal: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.

    "text": " Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing it as a geometric series or something else. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but nested. However, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more like a recurrence relation, which I've already solved. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see. Each time we have 1 + 3*(...), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Wait, but in this case, since each layer is only one level deep, not infinitely, it's a finite sum. Let me see how that would work. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote the innermost as S1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. S4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. S5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. S6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. S7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. S8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. S9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe I can write this as a sum. Let me see: Each S_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I found earlier. So, S9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =29524. Therefore, 3*S9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, because 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yes, that's another way to see it. So, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recurrence relation, and using the closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 *3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000 +600=9600 +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, starting with a_1=4, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, to find a_9, we can compute each a_n up to n=9, which is exactly what I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula helped confirm that my step-by-step computation was correct. I think this is solid now.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I let a_n be the value at the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, equate the terms: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + (1 + 3D). Therefore, D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the computations, and both the recursive step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result.

Then 1 + 3279=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks like a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it as such. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric progression. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, let me check that formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each term as I did before, but maybe for understanding, let's see if we can find a pattern or formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10. Since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, which is 3*a9, where a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11=177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Each layer adds another power of 3. So the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))). So, recognizing this pattern allows us to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, which in this case, after expanding, gives us the same result as computing each layer step by step. Therefore, whether I compute each layer manually or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give me the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time you add 3 times the previous result. That sounds like a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (c=1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I got earlier. So, that confirms that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a geometric progression. Since each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and starting from a_1=4, it's a geometric series with ratio 3. But using the recurrence relation method seems more straightforward here. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x, applied nine times, and then multiplied by 3. So, if I denote f^n(x) as applying f n times, then the innermost expression is f^1(1) = 1 + 3*1=4. Then f^2(1)=f(f(1))=f(4)=1 + 3*4=13. Similarly, f^3(1)=f(13)=1 + 3*13=40, and so on. So, the nth layer is f^n(1). Then, the entire expression is 3*f^9(1). So, if I can find a general formula for f^n(1), that might help. Let me see if f(x) = 1 + 3x is a linear function, so maybe it can be expressed as f(x) = a*3^n + b, where a and b are constants to be determined. Let's test this. Suppose f^n(x) = a*3^n + b. Then, f^{n+1}(x) = f(f^n(x)) = 1 + 3*(a*3^n + b) = 1 + 3a*3^n + 3b = 1 + a*3^{n+1} + 3b. On the other hand, if f^{n+1}(x) = a*3^{n+1} + b, then we have: a*3^{n+1} + b = 1 + a*3^{n+1} + 3b. Subtracting a*3^{n+1} from both sides: b = 1 + 3b. Then, subtract 3b from both sides: -2b = 1 => b = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the general solution is f^n(x) = a*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find a. When n=0, f^0(x) = x. So, f^0(1) =1. Plugging into the formula: 1 = a*3^0 + (-1/2) => 1 = a*1 - 1/2 => a = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is f^n(1) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: f^1(1)= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, as we saw earlier. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, f^n(1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, f^9(1) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so f^9(1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*f^9(1)=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the answer is 88572. I think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by using the general formula derived from the recursive function. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, L_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see, solving this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works.

So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression seems to be a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we add 1 and multiply by 3. Wait, but that's not exactly a geometric series. Let me see. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression. Let me write the entire expression step by step: Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand all layers, I might get a sum of terms with powers of 3. Let me try that. Let me denote the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand E step by step. Let me define each layer as before, a_1 to a_9, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, etc., up to a_9. Then E = 3*a_9. But using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, so E = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result. This method is faster because it uses the formula derived from the recurrence relation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, especially since it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, this recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form formula. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug the recurrence into this form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's substitute a_n = A*3^{n} + B into the equation: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B=-1/2, so: 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think I've got the right answer here. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but breaking it down step by step helped. I also thought about whether there's a pattern or formula to make it easier, and it turns out there is a closed-form solution which confirms the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute it without going through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the original expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. I think I've got it. The final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me recap: The problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost, each layer was computed step by step, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Additionally, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation confirmed that the result is correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So 27000 + 2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive expression. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Let me just cross-verify with a different approach. Maybe expanding the expression step by step, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, since each layer is a geometric series, perhaps I can see it that way. Each a_n is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), which is a geometric series with ratio 3. The sum of a geometric series with n terms is (r^{n} -1)/(r -1). But in this case, each layer adds another term, so it's similar but not exactly the same. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence as I solved earlier. So, I think my approach was correct.

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first \"1+3(\", that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n10. ...1+3)))\n\nWait, actually, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, but the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1, then each subsequent is a new layer. So, from the expression, starting with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" inside: Starting after the first 3(, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, the first is Layer 1: 1+3(...), then Layer 2: 1+3(...), up to Layer 9. Because the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1, and each time we go out, it's another layer. So, total layers: 9. So, the computation I did earlier with 9 layers is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next until reaching the outermost layer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x. Then, solving for x, we get x = (1)/(1 - 3) but that would be negative, which doesn't make sense here because all our terms are positive. Wait, maybe it's a finite series. Since there are 9 layers, maybe it's a geometric progression with 9 terms. Let me consider that. Let me denote each layer as x_n, where n is the layer number. So, x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 x_2 = 1 + 3x_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 x_3 = 1 + 3x_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to x_9. Then, the total expression is 3x_9. So, perhaps we can find a general formula for x_n. Let's try to find a recurrence relation. Each x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is x_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume x_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is x_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition x_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: x_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: x_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches. So the formula works. Therefore, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern and just computed each layer step by step, I would still get the same result, which is reassuring. I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, we determine that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc., which matches what I did before. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me try to express it that way. Let me denote the entire expression as S. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But wait, the inner part is similar to S/3, because S = 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the inner part is 1 + 3*(inner part). Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, and we have 9 layers, and then we multiply by 3 at the end. So, using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as above, then S =3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divide by 2: 177144/2=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, let me compute each layer again, just to be thorough. Layer 1:1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using a formula, especially if they're repeated multiple times. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, which would be a simple case. Solving for x: x = 1 + 3x => x - 3x = 1 => -2x = 1 => x = -1/2. But in our case, the layers are finite, so it's not an infinite recursion. So, maybe each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see: Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

    "text": " Wait, 3*364 is 1092, yes. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's do it step by step: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each layer is a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula saved me from computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there were only nine layers, both methods worked fine. However, it's good to know that the closed-form exists for future problems. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (3^{n} -1)/2, but I had to derive it through the recurrence. Anyway, I think I've computed this correctly. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 =4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). I computed each layer up to the ninth, which gave me 29524. Then, multiplied that by 3 to get 88572. Using the recurrence relation, I also found that a_9 is (3^10 -1)/2=29524, so 3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I expand all the layers, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Let me try to write it out step by step, but that might be too tedious. Alternatively, using the formula I found earlier, since each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the initial layers, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading up to Layer 9, which is 29524. Finally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We can solve for A and B. But since the recurrence is nonhomogeneous (due to the +1 term), the particular solution will be a constant. Let me find the homogeneous solution first. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we'll assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - b*L_{n-1} = a. The characteristic equation would be r = b, so the solution would be L_n = C*b^n + (a/(b-1)). Let me apply that here. Here, a = 1, b = 3. So, the solution would be L_n = C*3^n + (1)/(3 - 1) = C*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3C + 1/2. Subtract 1/2: 4 - 1/2 = 3C => 7/2 = 3C => C = 7/6. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Simplify: (7/6)*3^n = (7/6)*3^n = (7*3^{n})/6 = (7*3^{n})/6 = (7*3^{n-1})/2. So, L_n = (7*3^{n-1})/2 + 1/2 = (7*3^{n-1} + 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (7*3^{0} + 1)/2 = (7*1 +1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (7*3^{1} +1)/2=(21 +1)/2=22/2=11. Wait, but earlier I computed Layer 2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again. Wait, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. Let me compute L_2 using the formula: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4=13, which is correct. Now, using the formula I derived: L_n = (7*3^{n-1} +1)/2. For n=2: (7*3^{1} +1)/2=(21 +1)/2=22/2=11. But that's incorrect because L_2 is 13. So, my formula is wrong. Let me see where I went wrong. Wait, when solving the recurrence, maybe I made a mistake in the particular solution. Let me try again. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Perfect, so the formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, where n starts at 1 for the innermost, we can compute it using this formula. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is L_1=4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be L_9. Let's compute L_9 using the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can also compute it using the formula without computing each layer, which might be faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable. Wait, let me just confirm 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that this is the correct answer. I think I've covered all the steps, checked my work both by computing each layer manually and by deriving a formula to compute the nth layer, which gave me the same result.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 ... L9 = 1 + 3*L8 So, each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3 Ln-1 = 0, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our previous result. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, if we let n=9, then the outermost layer is 3*(3^(10) -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

    "text": " Wait, 3*364 is 1092? Let me check: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Yes, that's correct. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is when we set it to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation lead to the same answer.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. So the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc. So perhaps we can find a formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C +1. Solving: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula. Since a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2= (3^{n+2}-3)/2. So for n=9, 3*a_9= (3^{11}-3)/2. 3^11 is 177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation lead to the same answer. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Proceed to the next layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Continue computing each subsequent layer:**\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Multiply the result by 3:**\n   - Final result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), etc. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. Similarly, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value we got earlier. So, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each time, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^(h) = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let me assume the particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I were to write a general formula for the entire expression, which is 3*(L_9), where L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to think about it.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see, the recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's compute L(2): L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution for n=2: 13 = A*3^2 + B => 13 = 9A + B. Now we have a system of equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's L(n) = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L(9), we can compute it using the formula: L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication step.

    "text": " Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ... ))) with n layers, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula. Let's denote each layer as L_k where k is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this recursively. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, L1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to represent the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous layer. So, expanding it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Let me try to write this out step by step: Let me denote E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Let me try to express E in terms of itself. Wait, but each layer is similar. Wait, perhaps if I consider that each layer is 1 + 3*next layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer builds on that. But since I've already computed it step by step and via the formula, maybe that's sufficient. Alternatively, I can think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Wait, but in the formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, L9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then E=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it enough ways. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer).\n3. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer.\n4. Using the formula for the nth layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find L_9 = 29524.\n5. Finally, multiplying by 3 gives the result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Yes, so 1 + 1092=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. So yes, Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3=4, then a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 12=13, etc. So it's a recursive formula where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1, so B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 3A = 4.5, so A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 or 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=59049/2 -1/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

    "text": " Wait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, another approach: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, if I let x be the innermost expression, then x=1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, with nine layers, it's a geometric series? Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps we can express it as a sum. Let me think. Let me write the expression as follows: Starting from the innermost: Let me denote E_n as the value after n layers. So E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13 E_3=1 +3*E_2=1 +39=40 etc., as before. So, as I found earlier, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, E_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*E_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the expression. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with nine 1s. Let's see: Let me write it out step by step. Let me define S as the entire expression. So S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand the innermost part first: The innermost is (1 + 3) =4. Then moving out, each layer adds another term. Let me try to express S in terms of itself. Wait, but since there are nine layers, it's finite, so maybe expressing it recursively isn't the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can write S as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) where the inner part is similar to S but shorter. Wait, but with nine layers, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that each layer contributes a certain power of 3. Let's see: Let me try to expand S step by step:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me compute the innermost first:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen S=3*29524=88572\n\nSo that's consistent with the earlier result. Alternatively, maybe using the formula I derived earlier, E_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so for n=9, E_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then S=3*E_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by coefficients. Let me try expanding S:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nIf I expand each multiplication step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote the innermost as A =1 +3=4\n\nThen moving out, B=1 +3*A=1+12=13\n\nC=1 +3*B=1+39=40\n\nD=1 +3*C=1+120=121\n\nE=1 +3*D=1+363=364\n\nF=1 +3*E=1+1092=1093\n\nG=1 +3*F=1+3279=3280\n\nH=1 +3*G=1+9840=9841\n\nI=1 +3*H=1+29523=29524\n\nThen S=3*I=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, it seems that no matter how I approach it, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for a finite geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, perhaps the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nLet me write it as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine 1s.\n\nWait, actually, the number of 1s is nine, but the number of multiplications by 3 is eight? Wait, no, each layer after the first adds another multiplication by 3. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1 +3, then each layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So, in total, there are nine 1s and eight multiplications by 3? Or maybe not exactly, but perhaps the total expression can be written as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's try expanding S without the outermost 3 for a moment. Let me define T = (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine 1s. Then S = 3*T.\n\nBut T itself is 1 + 3*(another expression with eight 1s). So, perhaps we can express T as 1 + 3*T', where T' is the expression with eight 1s. But since I'm trying to find a pattern, maybe it's better to use the formula I derived earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nIf I expand this, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to a certain power, depending on its depth.\n\nLet me try to write S as:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nExpanding from the inside out:\n\nStart with the innermost 1 + 3 =4\n\nThen next layer:1 +3*4=13=1 +12\n\nNext:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nNext:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nNext:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen S=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, yes, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a 1 added, and then multiplied by 3 in the outer layers. So, starting from the innermost, each 1 contributes 3^{n} where n is the number of layers above it.\n\nWait, for example, the innermost 1 is at layer 1, and it's multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 8 layers above it) before being added to the total. Similarly, the next 1 is at layer 2, multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is at layer 9, multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nSo, the total sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, but each term is multiplied by 1, but actually, each 1 is at a different layer, so the total sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, but each multiplied by 1, so the sum would be (3^9 -1)/2, which is 29524, as before. Then, S=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that's another way to think about it. The sum inside the parentheses is a geometric series where each term is 1, multiplied by 3^k for k from 0 to 8. The sum of a geometric series is (r^{n} -1)/(r -1). Here, r=3, n=9 terms (from k=0 to 8). So sum = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 =19682/2=9841. Wait, but that's not matching with the earlier value of 29524. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the number of terms. Wait, in the expression, each 1 is at a different depth. The innermost 1 is at depth 1, then the next at depth 2, up to depth 9. So, the number of terms would be 9, each multiplied by 3^{9 - depth}. So, the sum would be sum_{k=1}^{9} 3^{k -1}. Wait, that's a geometric series with 9 terms, starting from 3^0 to 3^8. So sum = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Then, the total expression is 3*(9841)=29523, which is not matching. Wait, that's inconsistent with the earlier result.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the innermost 1 is at layer 1, and each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the first 1 (innermost) is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the sum inside the parentheses is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k *1, which is indeed (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*9841=29523. But that contradicts the earlier result where I computed the innermost layers step by step and got 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me recount. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 +3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, each contributing a 1 and a multiplication by 3. So, when I expand it, the sum inside the parentheses is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Then, S=3*9841=29523. But earlier, when I computed step by step, I got S=88572. That's a discrepancy. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's check the step-by-step computation again.\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen S=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the geometric series approach, the sum inside should be 9841, and S=3*9841=29523. That's conflicting. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but the sum inside is 9 terms? Wait, no, when I expand step by step, layer 9 is 1 +3*layer8=1 +3*9841=29524. Then S=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the geometric series approach, the sum inside is 9841, which would make S=29523. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the geometric series approach is missing something. Let me think. Each layer adds a 1 and a multiplication by 3, but each subsequent layer is multiplied by 3 again. So, the total sum inside the parentheses is actually 1 + 3*(1 +3*(1 +...)), which is the same as the expression we're computing. So, if I let T =1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)), then T =1 +3*T', where T' is the same expression but one layer less. But in our case, since it's finite with 9 layers, maybe the geometric series approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the step-by-step computation is correct, and the geometric series approach is flawed because the series isn't infinite. Let me check.\n\nWait, if I have nine layers, the sum inside is E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then S=3*E_9=88572.\n\nBut when I thought of the sum as (3^9 -1)/2=9841, that was for eight layers, not nine. Wait, because E_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, E_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which matches the step-by-step result. Therefore, S=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, earlier when I thought of the sum as (3^9 -1)/2=9841, that was for n=8 layers, which would be layer8 in the step-by-step approach. So, I must have misapplied the formula earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, let me compute 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) using another method. Let me write it as:\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step, as I did before, but let me write down all the layers:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, S=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is contributing a term that's 3^{n} where n is the number of layers above it. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the sum inside the parentheses is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Wait, but that's only 9 terms, but when I computed layer9, I got 29524, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, perhaps the sum inside the parentheses is actually sum_{k=1}^{9} 3^{k-1} = (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Then, S=3*9841=29523, which contradicts the step-by-step result. So, I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine 1s. So, the innermost is 1 +3=4, which is after the first multiplication. So, the sum inside the parentheses is actually sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k *1, which is (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Then, S=3*9841=29523. But that contradicts the step-by-step computation where S=88572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the geometric series approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum inside the parentheses is not (3^9 -1)/2, but (3^{10} -1)/2. Because in the step-by-step approach, layer9 is (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. So, S=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside the parentheses is (3^{10}-1)/2, which is 29524, and S=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the mistake in the geometric series approach was that I considered only nine terms, but actually, the sum inside the parentheses is for ten layers, which is why it's (3^{10}-1)/2. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the answer is 88572. I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process continues for nine layers, resulting in the innermost value being 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but stepping through each layer was a good way to confirm. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then the total is 3*a_9. So, maybe this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n^h - 3*a_{n-1}^h = 0, which gives a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, the total sum can be expressed as a geometric series. But since the expression is finite (nine layers), the formula applies as above. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) another similar expression.

So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4=13 L_3=1 + 3*L_2=1 + 39=40 L_4=1 + 3*40=121 L_5=1 + 3*121=364 L_6=1 + 3*364=1093 L_7=1 + 3*1093=3280 L_8=1 + 3*3280=9841 L_9=1 + 3*9841=29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=88572. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3L_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n3. Finally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
