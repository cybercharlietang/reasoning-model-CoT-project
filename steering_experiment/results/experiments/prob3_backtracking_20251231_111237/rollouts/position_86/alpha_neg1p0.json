Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

Let me just check once more: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1093. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then Layer7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then Layer8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then Layer9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula. Let's denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a2, etc. So, in general, a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_k + c = 3*(a_{k-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to solve it directly. Let me write down the first few terms: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier. The recurrence is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a1=4. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_k. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Wait, but that seems odd because all our a_k terms are positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the particular solution is a constant. Let me check again: Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's correct, but since our initial terms are positive, maybe the general solution is A*3^k + (-1/2). Let me check if that works. So, a_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, let's apply the initial condition a1=4. So, when k=1, a1=4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k -1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, a1=4. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a2=13. For k=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a3=40. So the formula works. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so k=9. Thus, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, it's quicker. But since I didn't remember the formula at first, breaking it down step by step was helpful. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've got it right. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 was accurate. The alternative method using the formula also confirmed the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Substitute back into the next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Continue this process for each layer:\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n4. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

I think I made a mistake here. When I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, and then 1 + 29523 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) which is 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, in my earlier calculation, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, but actually, that's the value before multiplying by 3. Wait, no, let me clarify: The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, Layer 8 is 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So that's correct. Hmm, but when I was recounting, I thought Layer 9 was 88573, which would be incorrect. So, I need to be careful here. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I got it right. But just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524, which we computed as 88572. Wait, but let me check 29524*3 again because I might have made a mistake there. 29524*3: Let's compute it as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 20000*3 +9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3 = 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12. Now, adding these up: 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, so a_1 = 4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. In this case, k=3, and c=1. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without computing each layer step by step. That's a good check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a linear recurrence. But regardless, both methods lead me to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1093. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*something. This seems like a geometric series, but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Wait, perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). Wait, but actually, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which would be a_2 = 13. Then a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 6 is correct? Wait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Yes, so 1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, the layers are as I computed: Layer1 to Layer9. So, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the computation seems correct. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. So, a recursive formula where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. So, assuming a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial conditions give a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each term is multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series with ratio 3, but since it's finite (nine layers), it's a finite geometric series. The formula for a finite geometric series is S_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, the structure is a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, perhaps the formula I used earlier is more applicable. Anyway, since both methods give the same result, I feel confident that the answer is correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the same result as before. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for L_n. Let's see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent L_n without computing each step. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. Here, a = 3, b = 1. The solution can be found using the formula for such a recurrence: L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in our case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula is a bit different. Let me recall the formula for the solution of L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. The general solution is L_n = a^{n} * (L0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me check. Let me consider the recurrence L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. Wait, actually, in our case, L1 = 4, which is the first term. So maybe the index starts at n=1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. The general solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * (L0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). But in our case, L1 = 4. So perhaps we can write L_n = a^{n} * C + D, where D is a particular solution. Let me try to find a particular solution. Assume a constant solution D, so substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = 3^{n} * C - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4: 4 = 3^{1} * C - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = 3^{n} * (3/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. This might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, but for 9 layers, both methods are manageable. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a multiple of 3 plus 1, building up in a geometric progression. But regardless of the method, the final answer is 88572. I think I've verified it sufficiently through multiple approaches: step-by-step computation, checking the recurrence relation, and using a closed-form formula. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wait, did I make a mistake here? Because 3*364 is 1092, so Layer 6 should be 1 + 1092 = 1093, which is correct. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think. The structure of the expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^(p) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without manually calculating each layer. That's a relief because it's easy to make a mistake when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, and we have 9 layers, maybe I can model this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me think. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But since we're doing this multiple times, perhaps we can express it as a sum. Let me write out the expansion. Starting from the innermost layer: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 Wait, that seems like each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 -1)/2, as before. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Similarly, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 =81 -1=80/2=40. So, indeed, each layer corresponds to (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the formula holds. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help. This expression seems similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me test that. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then plug back into L_1: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually. Let's see, Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I think about it as a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. But since it's nested, the formula approach worked better. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\).

Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose I have n layers, each defined as L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, etc., as I computed before. Then, the total expression is 3*L_n, where n=9 in this case. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_k. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} Substitute L_{k} = A*3^k + B: A*3^k + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{k-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^k + B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. Subtract A*3^k from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when k=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern leading to a closed-form solution. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now apply initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as before. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that confirms the earlier result.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times this occurs. From the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. So, how many layers? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first layer inside is 1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let's parse the expression step by step: Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then, moving out, it's 1+3*(layer1), which is layer2. Then, 1+3*(layer2)=layer3. Continuing, each time we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs inside the parentheses. Let me write the expression with indices:\n\nLayer9: 1+3( Layer8 )\nLayer8: 1+3( Layer7 )\nLayer7: 1+3( Layer6 )\nLayer6: 1+3( Layer5 )\nLayer5: 1+3( Layer4 )\nLayer4: 1+3( Layer3 )\nLayer3: 1+3( Layer2 )\nLayer2: 1+3( Layer1 )\nLayer1: 1+3\n\nWait, so from Layer1 to Layer9, that's 9 layers. So, a_9 is Layer9, which we computed as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the expression being 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, if I consider the innermost expression as 1 + 3, then each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, with 9 layers, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives a_9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute the layers again numerically:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all checks out. I don't think I made any calculation errors. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the formula using the recurrence relation confirms the result. So, I think I'm done here.

This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the outermost layer, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3, it's more of a geometric progression. But since the layers are nested, it's more of a recursive sequence, which we've already solved. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result. 3. Notice the pattern and derive a formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation. 4. Apply the formula to find the value of the outermost layer. 5. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. 6. Verify each step to ensure accuracy. So, yeah, that's how I would approach solving this problem. It took a bit of time, but breaking it down made it manageable. I think the key was recognizing the repeating pattern and then using the recurrence relation to find a general formula, which saved me from computing each layer manually beyond a certain point. Although, in this case, since there were only nine layers, computing each one step by step wasn't too bad, but for more layers, the formula would be essential. Anyway, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Layer 7 is correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Wait, 3280 is 3000 + 200 + 80? Wait, 3280 is 3000 + 280, and 280 is 200 + 80. So 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 8 is correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Layer 9 is correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Suppose we have a term like x = 1 + 3x, but that's a different situation. Wait, in this case, each layer is x = 1 + 3y, where y is the next layer. But since each layer is similar, maybe there's a pattern. Let me see: Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n + c = 3(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve it as a non-homogeneous recurrence. The equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form a_n = B. Plugging into the equation: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is a_1, then a_2 up to a_9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, using the formula, I can see that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it without calculating each layer manually. But since the number of layers isn't too large (only 9), computing each layer step by step was manageable. However, if the number of layers were larger, the formula would be more efficient. I think I've verified it sufficiently, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can check with a different approach. Perhaps this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, since the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, we can solve this recurrence relation. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + k, where k is a constant particular solution. Let me find k. Suppose a_n = k for all n. Then substituting into the recurrence: k = 1 + 3k => k - 3k = 1 => -2k =1 => k = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to nine layers. Using the recurrence relation approach, I found that the value of each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, all my methods point to the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach corroborates the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting with 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let me compute a_9 using this formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Since each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I've got this right.

Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840.

Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, I think I miscounted the layers. The original expression has 9 layers, but when I started from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time I was adding a layer, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with 9 sets of parentheses. Let me check how many layers I actually have. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each outer layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then layer 2: 1+3*(layer1). Then layer3: 1+3*(layer2). So, each time we go out, it's another layer. The original expression is 3*(layer9). So, total layers from innermost to outermost: layer1 to layer9. So, I think I computed correctly up to layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, I think that's correct. Let me just verify each step again. Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.

Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, which matches layer1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, layer2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, layer3=40. So, this formula works. Therefore, layer9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, layer9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*layer9=3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirmed the result I got by manually computing each layer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both methods gave me the same result. Plus, each step checked out when I reevaluated them. So, yeah, 88572 should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way out.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wait, that seems correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each next layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: Let's see, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought earlier, because from the innermost to the outermost, each time you have another layer. So, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the computation seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 88572 seems like a big number. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without going through each layer manually. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on, up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct because both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find each layer's value and ultimately compute the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a repeated structure of 1 + 3*(...), which can be solved layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Define Layers**: Let each layer \\( L_n \\) be defined as \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Recurrence Relation**: Solve the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then total expression is 3*L9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recursive sequence. Let me think: Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for C and D. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but since I already solved it step by step and verified it with the recurrence relation, I think that's thorough enough.

    "text": " Layer 6 is 1093, right? Let me check 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Yes, so 1 + 1092=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I think of this as a recurrence relation, where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence might give a formula for the nth term, which could be faster than computing each layer step by step. Let me try that approach to verify. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and it's a nonhomogeneous one. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to expanding a geometric series. But since each term is multiplied by 3, the expansion would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some power. But in this case, since it's nested, it's not exactly a simple geometric series. However, using the recurrence approach worked well. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the final value of 88572. I can also see that using the recurrence relation gives the same result, which adds confidence to the solution. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me check if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B. Let me solve it: The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can see that each layer is a term in a geometric sequence, so maybe there's a way to represent the entire expression as a sum of geometric series, but since we've already solved it using the recurrence relation and verified it, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute each layer one more time quickly: Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Multiply by 3: 88572. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a_9. So, each term is defined recursively by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, but wait, actually, in our case, the innermost layer was a_1, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous. So, the outermost layer would be a_9. Therefore, the value at the outermost layer before multiplying by 3 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then we multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using the closed-form formula also gives me 88572, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we can determine each layer's value step by step. Ultimately, the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.

Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the expression has 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, this matches the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Using the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572. Yes, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or use the closed-form expression, I get the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards and applying the formula for the recurrence relation, we find the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9: 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier breakdown, Layer 1 was 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try solving it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, but let's check: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is a_2 = 13, which is (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Similarly, Layer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count how many times 3 is multiplied. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds a 3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a multiplication error in the final step. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then +9524: 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can use another method to compute each layer. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula: a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to approach the problem, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula, which gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me recompute the layers again quickly. Layer 1:1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I'm good. Another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each step is 3*previous +1. So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, times 3 is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4, and we have 9 layers, so a_9 is as computed.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recurrence relation? Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Then substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => Subtract 3*L_p from both sides: -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(L_9) where L_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, so total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Wait, 3*(3^{10})=3^{11}, so yes, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same answer. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is L_1 = 1 + 3, so that's correct. Now, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant, so L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, but that seems odd because all our layers have positive values. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me write the first few terms and see if I can spot a pattern. L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express L_n as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L_3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, which matches L_4=121. So, yes, it seems that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which again matches. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer. But since the problem is to compute it step by step, I think my initial approach is fine, even if the formula gives the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Then substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p =1 => -2*L_p=1 => L_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4. So when n=1, L1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula holds.

Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 is 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572, which matches our earlier result. So, using the formula, we can see that the answer is 88572. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think this solidifies that 88572 is indeed the correct result. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049. Then, (59049 -1)=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Perfect.

Alternatively, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let's see: The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or find a formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence, we find a general formula for a_n and compute the outermost layer, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, this formula works. So, in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of a formula without computing each layer, I could use this approach. But since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. Just needed to be careful with each multiplication and addition. I think I did it correctly, but just to be absolutely sure, let me verify each step again: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 =13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n3.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if each layer follows a specific formula. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it directly using the formula without computing each layer. Since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's pretty thorough. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, as far as I can tell. Each step checks out, both manually and through the formula. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without going through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is L_1, and the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, the value at L_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, if I wanted to compute it directly, I could have used L_n for n=9, which is (3^{10}-1)/2, and then multiplied by 3. But regardless, the result is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting with L_1: 1+3=4. Correct. L_2:1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. L_3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. L_4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. L_5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. L_6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. L_7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. L_8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer.

Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then, moving out, each 1+3(...) is another layer. So, let me count the number of 1+3(...): 1. 1+3(1+3(...)) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have another layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears, each time wrapping another layer. Let me see: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, there are 9 layers. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 1+3(...), so the number of layers is 9. Because starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I had layer 1 to layer 9, each time adding a layer, so 9 layers, and then the outermost 3 multiplies the result. So, that seems correct.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, but it's a finite number of layers, so maybe we can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, in this case, the layers correspond to a_1 up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=3*59049=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the same answer, which reinforces that it's correct.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1093. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a specific sequence. Let me check if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series. Wait, actually, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote a_n as the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 =13, a3=1 +3*a2=1+39=40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a finite number of layers, maybe 9, it's easier to compute each step as I did before. However, for practice, let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10}=59049, so a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, then used a general formula to confirm the result. It seems consistent. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a couple of layers manually again. Let's check Layer 3: Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13=39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.

But just to make absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers. Let's try that. Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Yep, that's consistent with what I got before. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute it using another method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or a formula. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. This seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4/2) - 1/2 = (81/2) - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Great, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose I have a term defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is correct. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is n=1, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and the general formula approach, verified each step, and arrived at the same conclusion.
