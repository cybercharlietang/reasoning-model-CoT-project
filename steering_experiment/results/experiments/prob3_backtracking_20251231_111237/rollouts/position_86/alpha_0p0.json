    "text": " Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 3, d = 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but our initial term is a_1 = 4, not a_0. Let me adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4, so a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. Then, the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Substituting a_0 = 4, we get a_n = 4*3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me simplify that: a_n = (8*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. Good, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2. Let's compute that. First, compute 3^9. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, a_9 = (9*19683 -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. Wait, that's different from my earlier result of 29524 for a_9. Wait, no, wait. Wait, hold on. Wait, in my initial computation, I computed a_9 as 29524, but according to this formula, a_9 is 88573. That's a discrepancy. That means I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step computation. Hmm, let me check where I went wrong. Let me go back to my step-by-step layers: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2:13 Layer 3:40 Layer 4:121 Layer 5:364 Layer 6:1093 Layer 7:3280 Layer 8:9841 Layer 9:29524 Then, total is 3*29524=88572. But according to the formula, a_9 should be 88573, and then the total would be 3*88573=265719, which is way larger. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the formula, a_n is defined as starting from a_0=4, so a_9 would be the 10th term? Wait, no, in my initial step-by-step, a_1 was the innermost layer, which is 4, and a_9 was the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, in the formula, n=9 would correspond to a_9 in the problem, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. So, according to the formula, a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2 = (9*19683 -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. So, according to this, a_9=88573, so the total expression is 3*88573=265719. But in my step-by-step, I got a_9=29524, leading to 88572. There's a big discrepancy here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in either my step-by-step computation or in the formula. Let me check my step-by-step again. Layer 1:1+3=4 Layer 2:1 +3*4=13 Layer3:1 +3*13=40 Layer4:1 +3*40=121 Layer5:1 +3*121=364 Layer6:1 +3*364=1093 Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280 Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841 Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 So, according to this, a_9=29524, which is different from the formula's 88573. So, which one is correct? Let me compute a_1 using the formula: a_1=(9*3^1 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches my step-by-step. a_2=(9*9 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. a_3=(9*27 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, which matches. a_4=(9*81 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364, which matches. a_5=(9*243 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093, which matches. a_6=(9*729 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280, which matches. a_7=(9*2187 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841, which matches. a_8=(9*6561 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches. a_9=(9*19683 -1)/2=(177147-1)/2=177146/2=88573. Wait, but in my step-by-step, a_9 is 29524, which is actually a_8 in the formula. So, I think I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...), so each layer adds another set. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences: There's 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a base layer, and each \"1+3(...)\" is a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's count: Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, which according to the formula is a_8=29524, so a_9=88573. Therefore, I think I miscounted the layers. The formula defines a_n as starting from a_0=4, so a_1=13, a_2=40, etc., up to a_9=88573. But in my step-by-step, I had 9 layers, ending at a_9=29524, which is actually a_8 in the formula. So, the confusion is whether the innermost layer is a_0 or a_1. In the formula, I set a_0=4, but in the step-by-step, Layer 1 was 4. Therefore, in the formula, a_n corresponds to Layer n+1 in the step-by-step. Therefore, for the original problem, which has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_8 in the formula, which is 29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_8=3*29524=88572, which matches my initial step-by-step computation. So, the formula suggests that a_n= (9*3^{n} -1)/2, where n starts from 0. Therefore, for the outermost layer, which is the 9th layer in the problem, it's a_8 in the formula, so n=8. Therefore, a_8= (9*3^8 -1)/2= (9*6561 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, my initial step-by-step was correct, and the formula was correct, but I just miscounted the layers. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, to avoid confusion, maybe it's better to think of the layers starting from 0. Let me try that. Let a_0=1+3=4 a_1=1+3*a_0=13 a_2=1+3*a_1=40 ... up to a_8=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_8=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the expression is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it as such. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, after n layers, the value is a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, which we've already solved. The solution is a_n= (9*3^{n} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=8 layers, a_8= (9*3^8 -1)/2= (9*6561 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_8=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without calculating each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, for example, starting from 1, if we did 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), it's similar to building a number where each digit is 1 in base 3. But in this case, we have 9 layers, so maybe it's equivalent to (3^9 -1)/2? Wait, no, that's similar to the formula we derived earlier. Wait, in our formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, as we saw. So, that seems to align. Therefore, the total expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to double-check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I could have multiplied 29524 by 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Substitute n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, for n=0, if we consider a_0, it would be 1, but since the recurrence starts at n=1, maybe we can find another equation. Alternatively, let's assume the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = D. Substitute into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Comparing this to the general solution L_n = A*3^n + B, we have B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (Layer 9): L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time you add 1 and then multiply by 3. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can model this, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let me try that. Let's denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is Layer 1. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is Layer 2. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, Layer 3. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence relation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result as before. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model it as such. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, each layer adds a term multiplied by 3^k. Let's try expanding the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 So, I see a pattern here. Each layer n adds another term 3^{n}. So, for layer n, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r = 3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the closed-form solution I found earlier. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same result. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. I think I've double-checked it enough times. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me check if there are nine layers. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each ( is a new layer.

Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me parse this. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression starts with 3(1+3(...)) and each (...) is another 1+3(...). So, let's count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first. Then, moving out, each 1+3 wraps around the previous. So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are nine instances of 1+3(...). Wait, but each of those is a separate layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, actually, there are nine layers inside the first 3.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested rather than summed. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which might help verify my earlier computations. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, actually, let me write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the closed-form formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9). And since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent.

Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*a_9, where a_9 is as above. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, solve the homogeneous equation: L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, L(n) = (3^(n+1)-1)/2, so 3*L(n) =3*(3^(n+1)-1)/2 = (3^(n+2)-3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^11 -3)/2. Compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 would be 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous plus particular solution. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these kinds of expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. That matches the earlier result. So, using the formula, we also get 88572. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think about this as each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, the expression is built up by multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. So, the total number of layers is 9, which means that the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 9 layers. So, using the formula for a geometric series, since each step is multiplied by 3, the total would be (3^{n} - 1)/2, but in this case, with n=9, so it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3, giving (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88572.

So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in general, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the outermost layer is L_9, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147. Therefore, the expression becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. Either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check if there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, just to verify. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Wait, perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, the first layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Now, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1, so B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*L9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think I've considered it thoroughly, so I can conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, let's define a recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 =13, which matches. Similarly, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc. So, we have a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula for a_n, which might help in computing the 9th term directly without computing each layer step by step. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C -3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum involving powers of 3. Each layer adds another power of 3, so maybe the total expression can be expressed as a sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, but multiplied by 3. Wait, let me check. Wait, actually, when I expand the expression, each term corresponds to a power of 3. Let me try to see: The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) which is similar to 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) and so on. Each time, it's 3 times a sum where each term is 1 plus 3 times another term. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a geometric series. Let me try to express it that way. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) Now, notice that the part inside the first parentheses is similar to E/3, because E is 3*(something), so the something would be E/3. Wait, let me check: E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) Let me denote S =1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)), so E=3*S. But S itself is 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)) which is 1 +3*S'. But S' is the same as S, because each time we have the same structure. Wait, but that might not be exactly correct because each layer is one step deeper. Alternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of E. Let me try that. Let me define S =1 +3*S', where S' is the next layer. But each S' is similar to S, but one layer deeper. However, since we have 9 layers, it's finite, so perhaps this approach isn't as straightforward. Alternatively, since we've already computed that a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2, and a_9=29524, then E=3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let's see: Each time you have a 1, which is 3^0, and each time you multiply by 3, so perhaps each layer contributes another power. Let me try to expand the expression step by step: Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4=3^1 +1? Wait, no, 1+3=4=3^1 +1. Then, 1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13=3^2 + something? 3^2=9, 13-9=4. Hmm, not sure. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps the expression can be represented as a sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, but multiplied by some factor. Let me compute the sum: Sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is exactly a_9. So, the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k =29524. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, so E=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer adds a power of 3, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k)=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step until reaching the outermost layer. Recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows for a closed-form solution, confirming the result. The final answer is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these repeated patterns can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which also matches. Good, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, but in our problem, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9). So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the earlier computed values to make sure. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've found a closed-form formula, we could have directly computed a_9 using the formula without computing each layer, which would have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, although it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Using the formula is more efficient and reduces the chance of error. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we found a closed-form solution, verified it with the initial computations, and then applied it to find the value of the ninth layer. Multiplying that result by 3 gives the final answer. I think that covers all the steps needed to solve the problem correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the cross-check using the closed-form formula confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Let's say we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, which would be a simple case. Solving for x would give x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's for an infinite series. In our case, it's finite, so maybe we can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is correct. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=0, we can consider a_0 as the base case, but since our expression starts at a_1, maybe we can find another way. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, which matches our earlier result. Similarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364, which is correct. So, the formula works, and thus, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a simple linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So yes, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. If I consider the entire expression as S, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to nine layers. But since it's finite, it's a finite nested expression, not an infinite series, so the geometric series approach might not directly apply, but the recurrence relation seems to work better. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula I found, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and since we have nine layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. To make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's not the correct breakdown because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, adding those products: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, adding digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Correct. So, after carefully computing each layer, verifying with a recurrence relation, and then a closed-form solution, and finally checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we can see that each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. So, that's consistent with what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms it again. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is adding another power of 3, but it's a bit more involved. However, since the recurrence approach worked and gave me the same result, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, recursively, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.

Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for a_9. So that's a good check. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So that's consistent as well. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any calculation errors that I can see, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, L(1) = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: L(2) = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To find a closed-form solution, we can observe that this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n goes from 1 to 9, with a_9 being the innermost expression. Wait, actually, in the original problem, the innermost expression is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to Layer 9. So, a_9 would be the value at the 9th layer, which is 29524 as we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods agree, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which can be seen as a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. But since we have a specific number of terms, 9 layers, the formula we derived using the recurrence relation is more straightforward. So, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula, the final result is determined to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution is a constant, say a. Then, a = 1 + 3*a. Solving for a: a - 3a = 1 => -2a =1 => a = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let's find B. When n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A is zero. But in our case, n is finite, so perhaps we can solve it using the recurrence. Alternatively, we can compute each term step by step as I did before, which seems straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can write out the expression as a geometric series. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding all the layers would give us a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to express Layer 9 in terms of a sum. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n...\nContinuing this pattern, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check for Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2, which is correct. Similarly, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, yes, each layer is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, where n is the layer number. But wait, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1, which would correspond to sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k, but that's 1 + 3 = 4. Similarly, Layer 2 is sum from k=0 to k=2 of 3^k, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which matches. So, Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is given by S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it using the geometric series formula, which might be faster for larger numbers of layers. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing step by step is manageable. However, it's good to know that there's a formula for the sum of a geometric series here.

The solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = a^n * (L0) + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me check that formula. The standard solution for L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b is L(n) = a^n * L0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1). In this case, L0 would be the initial term before L1. Wait, but in our case, L1 is the first term, which is 4. So, perhaps L0 is 1? Let me see: If n=1, L1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, L0 = 1. Then, using the formula: L(n) = a^n * L0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1). Here, a=3, b=1, L0=1. So, L(n) = 3^n * 1 + 1*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2. Simplifying: L(n) = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that seems promising. Let me test it with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is correct. So, the formula L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 holds for each layer. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L9, so L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, using the formula is much faster, especially for a larger number of layers. It's always good to recognize patterns and see if a formula can be applied to save time. But in this case, since the problem had only nine layers, computing each step was manageable, though a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, using the formula is more efficient, especially if there were more layers. Let me just confirm the formula again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = C*3^n. The particular solution for the constant term b=1 is a constant, say K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the earlier result. So, the formula is correct. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods\u2014computing step by step and using the formula\u2014give the same result. It's always reassuring when two different approaches confirm the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me write the homogeneous solution first. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we find the 9th layer to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, which matches Layer 4. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let's see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be expanded as 3 + 9 + 27 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Wait, but each layer adds a term. Let me see: If I expand the expression, starting from the innermost: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try expanding it step by step:\n\nFirst, let's consider the innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, as before. So, each layer adds another term when expanded. Alternatively, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) Let's try expanding it:\n\nStart with the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, the expression could be thought of as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I let x be the innermost expression, then x = 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*x = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 40, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps if I consider the entire expression as a sum. Let me see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I expand this, starting from the innermost:\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nAs I expand each layer, I get:\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)))))))\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4)...)), where there are 9 layers of 3s. But maybe it's easier to stick with the step-by-step approach I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the nth term of a geometric series. The formula we derived earlier was L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've verified it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). It's a nested multiplication, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me try to find a general formula for such an expression. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1. Then, each layer corresponds to a term in this sequence. So, in our case, we have nine layers, so a_9 would be the innermost part, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me try to find the particular solution. Assume the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate coefficients: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 1: 1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 1 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 3/2 => A = 1/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (1/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Therefore, in our problem, we have nine layers, so a_9 = (3^9 - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\nSo, a_9 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier when I computed layer 9, I got 29524. Hmm, that's different. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(a_9), right? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), so starting from a_1 = 1 + 3*(next layer), but in our case, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3, which is 4, which is a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. Wait, maybe I misaligned the layers. Let me clarify. If I define a_1 as the innermost expression: a_1 = 1 + 3. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, which would be the outermost layer. But in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). So, in my earlier calculation, I computed up to layer 9 as 29524, which would be a_9 in that case. But according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let's test that. If a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then using the formula, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula, a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1) = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then multiplied by 3 is 88572. So, that's the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step isn't too bad. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers: Looking at the results of each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.

So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem since we only have nine layers. But just for my understanding, let's see if we can model this.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo layer 9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which confirms the answer.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would be more efficient, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we can set up two equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2): 6A = 9 \u21d2 A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u21d2 9/2 + B = 4 \u21d2 B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier values: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the original problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. I know that 3^5=243, so 3^10 = (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243^2: 243 * 243. Let's compute this step by step. 243 * 200 = 48,600 243 * 40 = 9,720 243 * 3 = 729 Now, add them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. So, 3^10 = 59,049. Therefore, L_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That's the same as I got before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 *3. Let me do it digit by digit: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=3*59,049=177,147. Therefore, (177,147 -3)/2 =177,144/2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88,572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is just building up the value exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the numbers get large pretty quickly, which is why the final answer is over 80,000. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes in my calculations. Let me recheck the multiplication: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000 +1,500=88,500 +60=88,560 +12=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, maybe it's a geometric series where each term is 3^n, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence relation of the first order. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, so it's like 3*(3*(3*(...*(1 + 3)...))) with nine threes. But in this case, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), it's similar to a geometric series but with a different structure. However, since we've already used the recurrence relation and verified it with both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, to recap, I started by computing each layer step by step, then realized there's a pattern and derived a formula to compute the nth layer directly, which gave me the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

But wait, I just thought about the structure again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Wait, does each \"1 + 3(...)\" correspond to each layer, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3? Let me count the number of layers correctly. Let me parse the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result of step 2)\n...\nAnd so on, until step 9, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Wait, but in my earlier breakdown, I had Layer 1 as 1 + 3, and Layer 9 as the outermost, and then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's correct. So, the computation is as I did before, leading to 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without going through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression after 9 layers is a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, this would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. So, either way, whether computing each layer or using the closed-form formula, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by substituting the previous result, leading up to the 9th layer, which is 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost.\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
