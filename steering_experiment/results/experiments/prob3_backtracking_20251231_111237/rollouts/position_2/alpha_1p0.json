    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to visualize it. It seems like there's a pattern here with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe it's a recursive structure or something that can be simplified by working from the inside out. \n\nAlright, so let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and working my way out. That sounds manageable.\n\nLet me write down each layer so I can keep track. Let's label them from the inside as Layer 1 to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses to be sure. Let's see: starting from the left, I see 3 followed by (1+3(...)), and each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so each time, it's a new layer. Let me count the number of times I see a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3*(1+3*(...))\n3. And this continues until the innermost part, which is (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. So, the first layer is the innermost (1+3), then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count them:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3*(...))\n3. (1+3*(...))\n4. (1+3*(...))\n5. (1+3*(...))\n6. (1+3*(...))\n7. (1+3*(...))\n8. (1+3*(...))\n9. (1+3*(...))\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of (1+3*(...)) and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, that's ten layers in total, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me write the expression more clearly, breaking it down:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the final result is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, starting from the innermost, each layer is (1 + 3*previous_layer). So, perhaps it's better to compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, with Layer 1 being the innermost (1+3). Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the one before the outermost 3 multiplication.\n\nSo, let's compute Layer 1 first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4: 12\n\nSo, Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nLayer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's do 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092\n\nLayer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279\n\nLayer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; so 9000+600=9600 +240=9840\n\nLayer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down:\n\n9000*3 = 27,000\n\n800*3 = 2,400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo, Layer 9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524\n\nCompute 3*29,524:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n20,000*3 = 60,000\n\n9,000*3 = 27,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29,524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, it's a geometric sequence where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. That makes me think of the formula for a geometric series, but with an additional constant term each time.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence relation, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, where k is a constant and c is a constant term.\n\nIn this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(k - 1))*(k)^{n-1} - (c)/(k - 1)\n\nWait, let me recall the formula correctly. For the recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + d/(r - 1))*(r)^{n-1} - d/(r - 1)\n\nWait, actually, let me derive it properly.\n\nGiven a recurrence relation:\n\na_n = r*a_{n-1} + d\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - r*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is k - r = 0, so k = r.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*r^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (d), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say P.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nP = r*P + d\n\nSolve for P:\n\nP - r*P = d\n\nP*(1 - r) = d\n\nThus, P = d/(1 - r)\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*r^n + d/(1 - r)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*r^1 + d/(1 - r)\n\nWe have r=3, d=1.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3)\n\nCompute 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2\n\nSo,\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nWe can factor out 1/2:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n(3/2)*3^n = (3^{n+1})/2\n\nSo, yes, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, this formula works.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, Layer 9 = a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 =29,524. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177,147\n\nThus, (177,147 -3)/2 =177,144/2=88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentials.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177,147\n\nThen, 177,147 -3=177,144\n\n177,144 divided by 2 is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. The innermost part is \\(1 + 3\\), and each subsequent layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 1: } 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 2: } 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

    "text": " Compute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses and threes. Let me see if I can figure this out. It seems like there's a pattern here where each part is 3 times (1 + something). Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next part is 1 + 3*(innermost result). Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so that gives me 13. Now, moving another layer out, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so now we're at 40. Let me keep going. Next layer out:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, that's 121. Moving out another layer:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWhoa, that's a big jump. Next layer:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, 1093. Another layer out:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWow, that's getting big. Let's continue.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nAnd another layer:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, right? Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, we get to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the whole thing.\n\nSo, the final step is:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure I didn't skip any layers. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, each time we go out, we add another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))))\n...\nContinuing until there are 9 layers. Wait, actually, in the original problem, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) parts:\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), each time there's a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)). Let's see:\n\n1. The first 3(...) is the outermost one.\n2. Then inside that, another 3(...), so that's two layers.\n3. Continuing, each time we have another 3(...), so each additional layer adds another 3(...).\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is followed by a (1 + ...). Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside that, another 3 followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- So each time, we have another layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result of 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result of 2)\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, it's another layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, so there are 9 layers. Let me confirm:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is enclosed in parentheses. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears inside:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I ended up with 9 layers leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try a different approach. Let's write down each step with the corresponding layer number.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from 1 + 3. So, yes, 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the expression has 9 layers. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears inside.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 represents a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...))\n- Continuing until we have 9 opening parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)). Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 3(1 + 3)\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's the first opening parenthesis.\n- Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), so that's the second.\n- Continuing until we reach the innermost part, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there after the first 3? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, there are 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nTherefore, as I computed earlier, starting from 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer adds another 3*(previous) + 1, and after 9 layers, we get 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Let me compute each layer again step by step, just to be sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each time, I multiply the previous result by 3 and add 1.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result, which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can look for a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = A*3^n + B\n\na_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n layers, the result is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem, we have 9 layers, each time applying the operation 1 + 3*(...). So, n = 9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that confirms it. So, the step-by-step process is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start from the innermost part and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down step by step:\n\n1. Innermost part: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find that the result of the innermost 9 layers is 29524. The entire expression is then 3 times this result:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nHmm, okay, so it's a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. Let me try to parse this out. It seems like each part is 1 plus 3 times something, and this pattern repeats multiple times. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. \n\nLet me rewrite the expression to visualize it better. Let's see, starting from the innermost part:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3\n\nThen moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So it's like a chain of these 1 + 3*(...) expressions. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time we add another layer until we reach the outermost one. \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses. From the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nI can see that starting from the first 3, each 1+3 is enclosed in more parentheses. Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. \n\nLooking at the expression, it's 1+3 nine times? Wait, let me check. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. But let me make sure. Each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one. So starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3. So in total, there are 9 layers of 1+3 expressions. \n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the first 3, it's followed by (1+3(...)), and each time, inside that, another 1+3(...), until the ninth one, which is 1+3. So yes, 9 layers of 1+3. \n\nSo perhaps the way to approach this is to compute the innermost expression first, then substitute back into the outer expression, and keep doing this until we reach the outermost layer. \n\nLet me try that. Let's start from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times the first layer. So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. So the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. \n\nWait, let me make sure. So in the original expression, it's 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1+3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. So yes, after computing Layer 9, we need to multiply by 3. \n\nSo let me compute 3*29524. \n\n29524 * 3: Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me just do it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\nx      3\n\n--------\n\nMultiply each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the layers again, maybe in a table format.\n\nLayer | Value\n-----|------\n1    | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. So each layer is correctly computed based on the previous one.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous, it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for it.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value at layer n, where L_1 = 4, L_2=13, L_3=40, etc. Then, the recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into this general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_{n} = A*3^n + B\n\nThen L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSimplify:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's take n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nThen, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this alternative method using the closed-form formula confirms our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nStarting from L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nSo, each layer adds another term of 3^{n} where n increases each time.\n\nWait, so L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but for n layers, starting from L_1 as 4=1+3, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nL_2=1 +3 +9=3^0 +3^1 +3^2.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nBut wait, L_1=4=1+3= sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k.\n\nSimilarly, L_2=13=1+3+9= sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k.\n\nSo yes, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nTherefore, L_n is indeed the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nThus, L_9 = sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this, both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a closed-form formula. Both approaches lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of 3s. Let me see: the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time it's 1+3*(previous expression). So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s multiplied by parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: each time you have a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1+3), then the next is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on, until we reach the outermost layer which is multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so the outermost is 3*(...). So perhaps the number of layers is 9, since each 3 is nested inside another 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s after each opening parenthesis. Hmm, maybe it's 8 layers because after the first 3, there are 8 more 3s inside. Wait, let me try to count the number of times 3 is followed by (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3*(...))\n3. (1+3*(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Wait, let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo each time, after the first 3, there are 8 more 3s inside. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo let's start:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me double-check how many layers I have. Each time I go up a layer, I'm adding another 3*(...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, is the outermost expression 3*(...), so yes, after computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3.\n\nSo let me compute 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad.\n\nAlternatively, I notice that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >=2.\n\nThen, we can see that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nGiven L_1 = 4, let's plug in n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B\n\nWe can also find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing step by step.\n\nThen the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the form 3*(1 + previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start with the innermost parentheses and work your way outward. So, let me count how many sets of parentheses there are here. Let's see... starting from the inside, each time I see a \"1+3\" inside another set. Let me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3).\n2. Then, moving outward, each time it's (1 + 3*(previous result)).\n3. So, let's see how many layers there are. Let me parse it:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n- The first innermost is (1 + 3).\n- Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from first)).\n- Then another layer outside that, and so on, until we have a total of 9 layers, because each time I see a multiplication by 3 and another (1 + ...). Wait, let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). Let's count the number of 3( at the beginning:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then another 3( inside: 3(1+3(\n3. Continuing, I see there are 9 instances of 3( before the innermost part. Wait, actually, no, because each time it's inside another set. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer2\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer3)\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer4\n... and so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and compute each step one by one. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost:\n\nLet me write this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another expression: 1 + 3*(result from innermost layer). So, let's compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, let me confirm: 3*(4) is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. Yes.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have another 3 multiplied by the previous result, then added to 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to write the structure more clearly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, but when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result).\n\nWait, let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define L1 as (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but then each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me structure it as:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). So, the outermost expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Wait, so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L1 = 4, then L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again, because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count how many 3( there are. Starting from the left, it's 3*(...). Then inside that, another 3*(...), and so on.\n\nSo, let's count the number of 3( in the expression:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then inside, another 3(\n3. And another 3(\n4. Another 3(\n5. Another 3(\n6. Another 3(\n7. Another 3(\n8. Another 3(\n9. And another 3(\n\nWait, but actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3( is another layer. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression after the initial 3( is:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3( appears after the initial 3(.\n\nLet me count the number of 3( in the entire expression.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then inside that, another 3(, and so on, until the innermost part, which is (1+3).\n\nSo, the number of 3( is 9, because each time, it's 3*(...). So, that would mean we have 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L1 = 4, then L2 = 13, up to L9 = 29524, as I calculated before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step because that's a lot of computation, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Because sometimes, when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount how many layers there are.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nEach 3( introduces a new layer. So, after the first 3(, there are 8 more 3( before reaching the innermost (1+3). Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3( after the first one:\n\n1. After the first 3(, we have 3(1+3(...), so that's the second 3(.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(, making it the third.\n\nContinuing this way, how many 3( are there?\n\nLet me count each occurrence of \"3(\" in the entire expression.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of times \"3(\" appears is 9. Because each time, starting from the first, each 3( is followed by another layer. So, the first 3( is at the very beginning, then inside that, another 3(, and so on, until the innermost part, which is (1+3). So, that would be 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had L1 to L9, each corresponding to a layer, starting from the innermost as L1. So, perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed L9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify each step again.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize a pattern or perhaps a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nL6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093.

It seems like each layer is another set of 1 + 3 times something. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with these kinds of expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to visualize it better. It's 3 multiplied by a bunch of (1 + 3(...)) terms. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), right? Let me see how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that's nine layers. Hmm, okay, so I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me number each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4\n... and so on, up to Layer 9, and then the outermost 3 multiplied by Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, let me make sure. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So maybe it's better to think of each step as computing the innermost expression first, then substituting back into the next layer.\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward.\n\nLet me write this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3*(Layer 1). So,\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + Layer 2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, multiply by 3.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(13) = 39\n\nThen, add 1.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nMultiply by 3.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(40) = 120\n\nAdd 1.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nMultiply by 3.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(121) = 363\n\nAdd 1.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nMultiply by 3.\n\nLayer 10: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me count the layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, each time, we have a 1 + 3*(...), which is two operations per layer. So maybe my initial count was off.\n\nLet me try again, perhaps by counting the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, so let's count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so L_1 would be 1 + 3, then L_2 is 1 + 3*L_1, and so on, up to L_9, and then the total is 3*L_9.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had 10 layers because I started counting from 1 to 10, but perhaps it's 9 layers. Let me make sure.\n\nLet me write out each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems too big. Let me check each step carefully because I might have made a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine (1 + 3(...)) terms, right? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers. So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, I ended up with Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But perhaps I misapplied the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), so Layer 9 is the innermost (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the outermost expression is 3*(...), so maybe the layers are 9, but the outermost is 3*(L_9), so I think my calculation is correct.\n\nBut let me verify each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, in case I made a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nWait, another approach: Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" corresponds to a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers, so n=9, which we've used in our formula.\n\nSo, yes, L_9 = 29524, and 3*L_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of operations that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the final result is multiplied by 3 to obtain the total value.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the inside and move outward. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, I notice that the innermost expression is (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, maybe I should handle each layer one by one. Let me number the layers from the inside out. There are nine layers of 3 multiplied by something. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left, each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a layer. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, nine layers in total. So, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the 9th layer and moving up to the first.\n\nLet me try to represent each layer as a step. Let me denote each step as S1, S2, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, S1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, S2: 1 + 3*(S1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, but looking back at the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(result of the next layer). So, starting from S1, which is 1 + 3, then S2 is 1 + 3*(S1), and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it as follows: starting from the innermost, compute each layer and substitute it into the next one.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with S1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, S2: 1 + 3*(S1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, S3: 1 + 3*(S2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. Wait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That's correct.\n\nThen, S4: 1 + 3*(S3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*(S4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's right.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*(S5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWait, 3*364: 364*3, let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Correct.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*(S6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nHmm, 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, S7 is 3280.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*(S7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, S8 is 9841.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*(S8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let me break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so S9 is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(S9). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing S9, which is the innermost part, we have each layer building up, and finally, the entire expression is 3*(S9). So, S9 is 29524, so the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that again. Because in the original problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, when I computed S1 to S9, each S is (1 + 3*(next S)). So, the outermost layer is 3*(S1), where S1 is 4. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm handling the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the layers differently. Let me see the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps each layer is (1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is (1 + 3*4) = 13, then next is (1 + 3*13) = 40, and so on, until the outermost layer is 3*(...).\n\nWait, so the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so 3*29524: Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, 20000 + 9000 = 29000\n\n29000 + 500 = 29500\n\n29500 + 20 = 29520\n\n29520 + 4 = 29524\n\nNow, 29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recompute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step checks out.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine layers of (1 + 3(...)), right? Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the original problem.\n\nOriginal expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is \"1+3(\" until the 9th layer, which is just \"1+3\". So, yes, nine layers.\n\nTherefore, each of the layers S1 to S9 is correctly computed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing it another way. Maybe using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nTherefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break down each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like each layer is 3 times something plus 1, and then multiplied by 3 again. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try to parse this.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part: 1+3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. Then, moving out one layer, we have 1+3(4). Wait, let me check that. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write this out step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as a term. Let's say the innermost part is layer 1, then layer 2 is the next one out, and so on until layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, counting the number of parentheses, I see there are nine opening parentheses and nine closing ones, so maybe it's nine layers? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, that's layer 1. Then the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(result of layer 1), that's layer 2. Then layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(result of layer 2), and so on, until we get to layer 9, which would be the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3*(result of layer 9).\n\nWait, but looking at the problem again, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so the outermost operation is 3 times something, which is the sum of 1 and 3 times the next layer. So, maybe there are nine layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(next layer), and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. Let me try to compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet's start with the innermost layer, which is 1+3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this result1.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3*(result1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this result2.\n\nNext layer out, result3 would be 1 + 3*(result2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nResult4: 1 + 3*(result3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nResult5: 1 + 3*(result4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nResult6: 1 + 3*(result5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nResult7: 1 + 3*(result6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nResult8: 1 + 3*(result7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nResult9: 1 + 3*(result8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(... )) so after computing result9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*result9. So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but maybe it's easier to compute digit by digit.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 30000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in these nested computations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again because sometimes when you count layers, you might miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each \"1+3(...)\" is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\", so there are 9 layers inside. So, the computation I did earlier, going up to layer 9, is correct. Therefore, the final result is 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Starting from the inside, I count nine sets of parentheses. So, it's like a Russian doll situation where each layer has another 1+3 inside it. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step.\n\nAlright, let me write this out more clearly.

So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7 result is 3280.\n\nLayer 8:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 8 result is 9841.\n\nLayer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9 result is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original problem is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we then multiply this by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, final step:\n\nFinal result = 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n= 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I can confidently say that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outwards.

I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, you start solving from the innermost one and work your way out. So, maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost expression first and then work my way outward.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3( something ). Since I just found that the innermost something is 4, let me substitute that in.\n\nSo, the next level is: 1 + 3(4)\n\nCalculating that: 3 * 4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so that simplifies to 13. Now, moving another level out, we have another 1 + 3( something ). The something here is the result we just got, which is 13.\n\nSo, the next level: 1 + 3(13)\n\nCalculating that: 3 * 13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nOkay, so now we have 40. Moving out another level, it's again 1 + 3( something ). The something here is 40.\n\nSo, next level: 1 + 3(40)\n\nCalculating that: 3 * 40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, this seems to be following a pattern. Let me check if this pattern continues. The next level out would be 1 + 3(121).\n\nCalculating: 3 * 121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait a minute, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Let's go through each step again to ensure I haven't made a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost: 3(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Each step adds another layer.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of times I have to compute this. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I compute a step, I move one layer out. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent 1 + 3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. Then the outermost 3(...)\n\nWait, so maybe I have nine layers of 1 + 3(...) and then the outermost 3(...). Let me try again, step by step, to make sure I don't skip any layers.\n\nLet me list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Then the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, let me see if there's a pattern here. Each time, the result is 3 times the previous result plus 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent result is 3n + 1, where n is the previous result.\n\nLet me list the results again:\n\n1. 4\n2. 13\n3. 40\n4. 121\n5. 364\n6. 1093\n7. 3280\n8. 9841\n9. 29524\n10. 88572\n\nSo, the final result after all the multiplications and additions is 88,572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a calculation mistake in any of these steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm the result. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI notice that each time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(something). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost expression.\n\nSo,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...).\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing a_9, then multiplying by 3.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found, but perhaps for 9 terms, it's easier to compute each step as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, we can observe that the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9,\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nThis matches the result I obtained earlier by computing each step manually. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Evaluate the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Substitute and evaluate the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue evaluating each subsequent layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n4.

It seems like each layer is a 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually makes sense with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Let's start from the innermost part and work our way out. So, the innermost expression is (1+3).

Step 6: Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Step 7: Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Step 8: Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Step 9: Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 9 layers, but here I have 9 steps after the initial 3, which would make it 10 layers. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscount earlier. Let me verify.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost. So, the number of times we apply this operation is 9 times, because the innermost is (1+3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's 9 steps after the initial 3, so including the initial 3, that's 10 layers. Hmm, maybe I should check if the original expression has 9 or 8 sets of parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)), then inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3: (\n2. Inside that: (\n3. Inside that: (\n4. Inside that: (\n5. Inside that: (\n6. Inside that: (\n7. Inside that: (\n8. Inside that: (\n9. Inside that: (\n\nSo, 9 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, after computing each layer, we end up with 9 results, and then the outermost 3 times that result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I ended up with 9 steps, each time computing a new layer, leading to the 9th step being 29524, and then the final step is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation in any step. Let me go through each step again:\n\n1. Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check if each step's multiplication is accurate.\n\n- Step 2: 3*4 = 12, 1+12=13. Correct.\n- Step 3: 3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct.\n- Step 4: 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct.\n- Step 5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct.\n- Step 6: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n- Step 7: 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n- Step 8: 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n- Step 9: 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000*3 = 60000\n- 9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n- 500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n- 24*3 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to see if there's a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each step, in case the number of layers is large. But since here we only have 9 layers, expanding step by step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^{n} - 1) + (a_0 - c/(k-1))*k^{n}.\n\nIn our case, k=3, c=1, and a_1=4.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=1: a_1 = 4.\n\nUsing the formula, a_n = (1/(3-1))*(3^{n} - 1) + (a_0 - 1/(3-1))*3^{n}.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, since each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and the solution can be found as a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D \u2192 D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches step 2.\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches step 3.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers starting from a_1 =4, so n=9.\n\nWait, but let me clarify: in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524.\n\nWait, so using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches step 9.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the outermost layer is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so 177147-3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572, which matches.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, step-by-step computation is feasible, and we arrived at the same result.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times the pattern (1+3(...)) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))\n9. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1+3*(...), each time adding another layer. So, when we compute up to a_9=29524, that's the value inside the outermost 3*(...), giving 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as starting with the innermost being a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524, then the final result is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost part:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, the outermost layer:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with these kinds of expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Starting from the innermost part:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out one level: 1 + 3*(result from innermost)\n\nWait, no, actually, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, maybe I can compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the inside out to keep track. There are nine sets of parentheses, so I'll label them from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\n1. Parentheses 1: 1 + 3\n2. Parentheses 2: 1 + 3*(result from 1)\n3. Parentheses 3: 1 + 3*(result from 2)\n4. Parentheses 4: 1 + 3*(result from 3)\n5. Parentheses 5: 1 + 3*(result from 4)\n6. Parentheses 6: 1 + 3*(result from 5)\n7. Parentheses 7: 1 + 3*(result from 6)\n8. Parentheses 8: 1 + 3*(result from 7)\n9. Parentheses 9: 1 + 3*(result from 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(result from 9). So, I need to compute each level starting from 1 and moving up to 9, then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nLet me compute each level one by one.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my multiplication again because 3*29524 should be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the levels.\n\nLet me go back and check each level step by step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all levels check out. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems correct, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(next level). This seems like a geometric series, perhaps?\n\nWait, if I consider each level as a term in a geometric sequence, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote the value at level n as a_n. Then, from the problem, we have:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. It looks like a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. From level 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each level n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for the first few levels. So, using this formula, I can compute a_9 directly.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59049, so:\n\na_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by computing each level step by step.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before, so it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nThis looks like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can express the innermost expression as a sum.\n\nWait, but since each level is nested, perhaps I can think of it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut perhaps using the formula for a geometric series would help here.\n\nWait, but in the expression, each term is 1 + 3*next term, so it's a bit different. Alternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to stick with the approach I took before, since the formula using the recurrence relation worked well.\n\nSo, to recap, by solving the recurrence relation, I found that each level n has a value of (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Thus, for level 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me think about it. Each time, we have a term that's 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, if I expand it, maybe I can write it as a sum.\n\nLet me try expanding the innermost parentheses first.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series where each term is 3^n, but I have to see how the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, let me think. If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nEach time, the innermost term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, then the next level does the same.\n\nIf I expand all the terms, perhaps I can see a pattern.\n\nLet me try expanding a few levels to see the pattern.\n\nStarting with level 9:\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(Level 7)) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*(Level 7)\n\nSimilarly, Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*(Level 6)\n\nWait, but this might get too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, using the formula I found earlier, each level n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, level 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a sum:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as S, then each step is 1 + 3*S, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it. Since I've already computed it step by step and using the recurrence formula, and both give me the same result, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n3*29524:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level step by step:\n\n1. Innermost level: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like each part is similar, so maybe I can solve it from the inside out. Let me try to write it down and see how it progresses.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\nSo, (1+3) is 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 1+3*(that result). Wait, let me check: the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). \n\nWait, actually, looking back, the structure is each time 1 + 3*(the next inner expression). So, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way outwards, each time substituting the inner expression with its value.\n\nLet me list each level step by step. I'll number them from the innermost as Level 1 to the outermost as Level 9.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), but Level 9 itself is built from the innermost Level 1.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). Let's count the levels. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Level 1. Then each subsequent level adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many levels there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost, I can see that there are 9 sets of parentheses, so I think there are 9 levels, from Level 1 to Level 9, each time building upon the previous one.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Level 1. Then the next one out is (1 + 3*(Level 1)), that's Level 2. Then the next one is (1 + 3*(Level 2)), Level 3, and so on until Level 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). Wait, but in the given expression, it's 3*(Level 9), but in the problem statement, the entire expression is 3*(...), so maybe I should include that as part of the computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the innermost is (1 + 3) and the outermost is 3*(...). So let's structure it as:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\n...\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n\nThen the final result is 3*(Level 9).\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so maybe the innermost is (1 + 3), and each subsequent level adds another 1 + 3*(previous level). So let me compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me create a table to keep track:\n\nLevel | Expression | Value\n-----|------------|------\n1    | 1 + 3      | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*(Level1) | 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3    | 1 + 3*(Level2) | 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4    | 1 + 3*(Level3) | 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5    | 1 + 3*(Level4) | 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6    | 1 + 3*(Level5) | 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*(Level6) | 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*(Level7) | 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*(Level8) | 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step again, because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n-------\n= (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly calculated Level9 as 29,524. Let me go back through the levels to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps.\n\nLevel1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the structure is correct. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and the outermost is 3*(...). So, yes, each level from 1 to 9 is computed as 1 + 3*(previous level), and then the final result is 3*(Level9). So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each level manually, but since there are only 9 levels, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's a pattern here. Each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B \u2192 B = 1 + 3B \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Level9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can confirm that the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThus, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each level is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous level)}\\).

It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So, maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually makes sense with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down as I go. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So, substituting the 4 in, it becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. Each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Hmm, no, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\n3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the next layer is 3*(1 + something), and that something is the result of the innermost expression, which is 4. So, 1 + 4 is 5, then 3*5 is 15. So, that's the next layer.\n\nThen, moving out another layer, we have 3*(1 + 15). Let me compute that.\n\n3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, so each time, the innermost result is used in the next layer. Let me see if I can keep track of this. Let me write it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Each time, I'm taking the result from the previous step and plugging it into the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step involves computing 3*(1 + result). So, perhaps I can list each step:\n\nStep 1: Compute innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Compute 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nStep 3: Compute 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nStep 4: Compute 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nStep 5: Compute 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nStep 6: Compute 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nStep 7: Compute 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nStep 8: Compute 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nStep 9: Compute 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but I'm seeing that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3, perhaps? Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, let me think. Each step is 3*(1 + previous result). So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something like that. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLet me try to represent each step as a function. Let\u2019s denote the value at each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers from the innermost. So, a_1 is 4, as we saw. Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. And so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, but how many layers are there exactly? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) expressions. Starting from the first 3, each time there's a 3 followed by (1 + ...). So, let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + ...)\n2. 3(1 + ...)\n3. 3(1 + ...)\n4. 3(1 + ...)\n5. 3(1 + ...)\n6. 3(1 + ...)\n7. 3(1 + ...)\n8. 3(1 + ...)\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), so up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to a_9, I got 36084. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation steps. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\n1. a1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. a2: 3*(1 + a1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. a3: 3*(1 + a2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. a4: 3*(1 + a3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. a5: 3*(1 + a4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. a6: 3*(1 + a5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. a7: 3*(1 + a6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. a8: 3*(1 + a7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. a9: 3*(1 + a8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, that seems correct. So, the final result would be 36084. But let me check this because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for this. Each step is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, since 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nTo find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 3 \u21d2 -2K = 3 \u21d2 K = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1.5 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 \u21d2 C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this: 11/6 * 3^n = (11/6)*(3^n) = (11/6)*(3^n) = 11*(3^{n-1}).\n\nWait, alternatively, 3^n = 3*3^{n-1}, so 11/6 * 3^n = 11/6 * 3 * 3^{n-1} = 11/2 * 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to leave it as (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683.\n\nThus, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683: Let's compute 19683 divided by 6 first.\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5.\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nCompute 3280.5 * 10 = 32805.\n\n3280.5 * 1 = 3280.5.\n\nSo, total is 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 from this, which is 1.5.\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. That's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me go through the step-by-step computation again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\n1. a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. a2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. a3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. a4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. a5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. a6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. a7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. a8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. a9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, that seems correct each time. Each step is just 3 times (1 plus the previous result), so 3*(1 + previous). So, each step is straightforward multiplication and addition.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough. So, the final answer is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 3(1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\n3. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 3(1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\]\n\n4. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 3(1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\]\n\n5. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 3(1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\]\n\n6.

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like each part is similar, so maybe there's a pattern I can follow. Let me try to work from the inside out, since that's usually how you handle parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, I see \"1+3\". That's simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. The innermost is the last (1+3), so I replaced that with 4. Now, moving one layer out, I have another 1 + 3 times something. Let me compute that next.\n\nSo, looking at the next layer: 1 + 3*(something). The something here is the result we just got, which is 4. So, 3*4 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nNow, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))\n\nWait, let me check. The next layer after the first 4 was 1 + 3*(4) = 13. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nContinuing outward, the next part is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\n3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, replacing that part:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40). Let's calculate that.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, replacing that:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))))\n\nMoving outward, next is 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute 3*121 first.\n\n3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, replacing that:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364.\n\n3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Replacing that:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093.\n\n3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Replacing that:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280.\n\n3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Replacing that:\n\n3(1 + 3(9841))\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841.\n\n3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Replacing that:\n\n3(1 + 3*(29524))\n\nWait, no, hold on. The expression after replacing the last part was 3(1 + 3(9841)), so after computing 3*9841 +1, it's 29524, so the next layer is 3*(29524). Wait, no, actually, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression after replacing 3(1 + 3(9841)) is 3*(1 + 3*(9841)) which is 3*(29524). So, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, actually, after replacing 1 + 3*(3280) as 9841, the next layer is 1 + 3*(9841). So, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, the next layer is 3*(29524). Wait, but in my earlier step, I think I went too far. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, let me go back step by step to avoid confusion.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, we get to 29524, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nSo, 3*29524 is the final step. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 So 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29524*3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps because that would throw everything off.\n\nLet me recompute each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and each multiplication and addition seems accurate. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1, repeated multiple times. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last intermediate result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Start with the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Work Outward:**\n   - Each subsequent layer is calculated as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous step)}\\).\n   - Compute each layer step by step:\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the last intermediate result by 3:\n     - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this out more clearly. Let's denote the innermost part as follows:\n\nStart with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's easy enough. Then, each subsequent layer is 3 times (1 plus the result of the previous layer). So, it's like each step is building on the previous one, multiplying by 3 each time.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step, starting from the inside.\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but hold on, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? So, that's the first step. Let me write that down.\n\nStep 1: Compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out is again 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then using that in the next layer. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nWait, actually, let me check: the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, maybe I should think of it as each step being 3*(1 + previous value). Let me try that.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the order. Let me think again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me count the number of layers. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression, I see that after the first 3*(, there are 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...). Wait, let me check:\n\nStarting with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds a 1 + 3*... So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(.\n\nEach 1 + 3*(... starts a new layer. Let me see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, but wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + (1 + 3)), then the next is 3*(1 + previous result), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it as follows: Let's define each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{i+1} = 3*(1 + a_i). Wait, but that might not be accurate because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Wait, no, let's see.\n\nWait, no, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, perhaps it's better to define it as a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1), a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2), etc., until a_8, because there are 8 layers after the initial 3*(.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3*(...). The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3*( is followed by 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, maybe I should compute 8 layers, each time computing 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try again, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, but that seems like 8 layers, right? Because starting from 1 + 3, then 8 more layers. So, the total expression would be 3*(9841). Wait, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from 1 + 3, that's the first innermost. Then, each layer adds one more 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers do we have?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as 8 layers. Let me try again.\n\nLet me list each step:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNow, after 8 layers, we have 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(9841). Wait, but let me check the original problem.\n\nWait, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, as I did before. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, 8 layers in total, leading to 9841, and then the outermost is 3*(9841). Wait, but in my previous count, I did 8 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous), resulting in 9841, and then the entire expression is 3*(9841), which would be 29523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sequences.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nLet me see, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3*(, there are 8 instances of 1 + 3*(...). So, 8 layers. Therefore, after computing the 8th layer, we get 9841, and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 3*9841 is indeed 29523.\n\nBut let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me verify each step again because it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*9841: Let's compute that.\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29.\n\nSo, writing it down: 29523.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 8 layers correctly. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears after the initial 3*(.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3*(...\n2. 1 + 3*(...\n3. 1 + 3*(...\n4. 1 + 3*(...\n5. 1 + 3*(...\n6. 1 + 3*(...\n7. 1 + 3*(...\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nSo, that's 8 layers after the initial 3*(. So, yes, 8 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), leading to 9841, then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula.\n\nWait, each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 8 layers, n = 8.\n\nThus, a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation earlier. So, I think that's correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^9 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3.\n\n9841*3:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29.\n\nSo, writing it down: 29523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 29,523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\nAfter computing the 8th layer, we get the result 9841. The entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{29523}\n\\]"

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions like this.\n\nAlright, so the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check that. The innermost was 1 + 3, so replacing that with 4, the next layer out is 1 + 3(4). Hmm, no, wait. Let me count the number of parentheses correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4.\n2. Then moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3(4).\n3. Then the next layer is 1 + 3(result from step 2).\n4. And so on, until we get to the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this more systematically. Let me number the layers from the inside out. So, starting with the innermost expression as layer 1, then layer 2 is the next one out, and so on until layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left, the first term is 3, then (1 + 3(...)). So each time, the expression inside is 1 + 3(...). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer's result).\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent this as a recursive expression. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost expression, and a_9 is the outermost one.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(a_9). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by a_9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the a_n computations.\n\nLet me go through each a_n step by step again:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, does the original expression have 9 layers? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking back at the problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer, which is the 9th layer. So, yes, 9 layers, so a_9 is correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is that each layer is a term in a geometric series. Let me see if that's applicable here.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nWait, from the a_n computations, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3.\n\nThen a_2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation.\n\nIn general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTo find C, we can solve the equation by assuming a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = C.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" before the last \"1 + 3\".\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last \"1 + 3\", then each preceding one adds a layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\" before the final closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers as the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The last \"1 + 3\" is layer 1.\n\n2. Then moving out, the next \"1 + 3(\" is layer 2.\n\n3. Continue until the outermost layer, which would be layer 9.\n\nWait, so that would mean there are 9 layers, each adding a \"1 + 3(\" before the next layer.\n\nTherefore, a_9 would be the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*a_8, and so on.\n\nSo, with a_9 = 29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution we found earlier is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully working through each step, checking each layer, and confirming with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus 3 times something). So, maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That makes sense because in order of operations, parentheses come first.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly. Let's denote each layer as a separate step. So starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: (1 + 3). That seems straightforward.\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times the result of (1 + 3 times the previous result).\n3. I think I can compute each layer step by step, each time substituting the innermost result into the next layer.\n\nLet me try to list out each step. I'll number them from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4.\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(result from Step 1)). So, substituting Step 1's result, it's 3*(1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm substituting correctly. So Step 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Step 1)). So yes, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nStep 3: Now, moving another layer out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(result from Step 2)). So that's 3*(1 + 3*39). Let me compute that: 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nWait, that seems like a big jump. Let me check: 3*39 is 117, plus 1 is 118, times 3 is 354. Yep, that's correct.\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(Step 3's result)). So 3*(1 + 3*354). Let's compute that: 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063. Hmm, 1063 times 3: 1000*3 is 3000, 60*3 is 180, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 180 is 3180, plus 9 is 3189. So Step 4 is 3189.\n\nWait, let me confirm that 3*354 is indeed 1062. Yes, because 354*3: 300*3=900, 50*3=150, 4*3=12. So 900+150=1050, plus 12 is 1062. Then 1062 + 1 = 1063, times 3 is 3189. Correct.\n\nStep 5: Next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(Step 4's result)). So that's 3*(1 + 3*3189). Let me compute that: 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568.\n\nWait, 3*3189 is 9567, right? Let me check: 3000*3=9000, 189*3=567, so 9000+567=9567. Then 9567 + 1 = 9568. Then 9568*3: Let's compute that.\n\n9568 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 60*3=180, 8*3=24. So adding them up: 27000 + 1500 = 28500, +180 = 28680, +24 = 28704. So Step 5 is 28704.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check 3*9568. 9568 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 60*3=180, 8*3=24. So 27000+1500=28500, +180=28680, +24=28704. Yes, that's correct.\n\nStep 6: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(Step 5's result)). So that's 3*(1 + 3*28704). Let's compute that: 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113.\n\nWait, 3*28704 is 86112, correct? Let me verify: 28704*3: 20000*3=60000, 8000*3=24000, 700*3=2100, 4*3=12. So 60000+24000=84000, +2100=86100, +12=86112. Then 86112 +1 =86113. Then 86113*3: Let me compute that.\n\n86113*3: 80000*3=240000, 6000*3=18000, 100*3=300, 10*3=30, 3*3=9. So adding them: 240000 + 18000 = 258000, +300=258300, +30=258330, +9=258339. So Step 6 is 258339.\n\nWait, that's a big number, but let me check: 86113*3: 80000*3=240000, 6000*3=18000, 100*3=300, 10*3=30, 3*3=9. So yes, 240000+18000=258000, +300=258300, +30=258330, +9=258339. Correct.\n\nStep 7: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(Step 6's result)). So that's 3*(1 + 3*258339). Let me compute that: 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018.\n\nFirst, 3*258339: Let's compute that. 200000*3=600000, 50000*3=150000, 8000*3=24000, 300*3=900, 39*3=117. So adding them up: 600000+150000=750000, +24000=774000, +900=774900, +117=775017. So 3*258339=775017.\n\nThen, 775017 + 1 = 775018. Now, 3*775018: Let's compute that.\n\n775018 * 3: 700000*3=2100000, 70000*3=210000, 5000*3=15000, 100*3=300, 8*3=24. So adding them: 2100000 + 210000 = 2310000, +15000=2325000, +300=2325300, +24=2325324. So Step 7 is 2325324.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check: 775018*3: 700000*3=2100000, 70000*3=210000, 5000*3=15000, 100*3=300, 8*3=24. So 2100000+210000=2310000, +15000=2325000, +300=2325300, +24=2325324. Yep, that's correct.\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(Step 7's result)). So that's 3*(1 + 3*2325324). Let's compute that: 3*(1 + 6975972) = 3*6975973.\n\nFirst, compute 3*2325324: 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 20000*3=60000, 5000*3=15000, 300*3=900, 24*3=72. So adding them up: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, +60000=6960000, +15000=6975000, +900=6975900, +72=6975972. So 3*2325324=6975972.\n\nThen, 6975972 + 1 = 6975973. Now, 3*6975973: Let me compute that.\n\n6975973 * 3: 6000000*3=18000000, 900000*3=2700000, 70000*3=210000, 5000*3=15000, 900*3=2700, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Let's add them up:\n\n18000000 + 2700000 = 20700000, +210000=20910000, +15000=20925000, +2700=20927700, +210=20927910, +9=20927919.\n\nSo Step 8 is 20,927,919.\n\nWait, let me verify that: 6975973 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n6,975,973 * 3:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, carryover 2\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 2 = 29, carryover 2\n\n3 * 7 = 21 + 2 = 23, carryover 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n\n3 * 6 = 18 + 2 = 20.\n\nSo writing it out: 20,927,919. Yep, that's correct.\n\nStep 9: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(Step 8's result)). So that's 3*(1 + 3*20,927,919). Let's compute that: 3*(1 + 62,783,757) = 3*62,783,758.\n\nFirst, compute 3*20,927,919: 20,000,000*3=60,000,000, 927,919*3: 900,000*3=2,700,000, 27,919*3=83,757. So 60,000,000 + 2,700,000 = 62,700,000, +83,757=62,783,757. So 3*20,927,919=62,783,757.\n\nThen, 62,783,757 + 1 = 62,783,758. Now, 3*62,783,758: Let's compute that.\n\n62,783,758 * 3: 60,000,000*3=180,000,000, 2,783,758*3: 2,000,000*3=6,000,000, 783,758*3: 700,000*3=2,100,000, 83,758*3=251,274. So adding up:\n\n180,000,000 + 6,000,000 = 186,000,000, +2,100,000=188,100,000, +251,274=188,351,274.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 62,783,758 * 3 digit by digit.\n\n62,783,758\n*           3\n------------\nLet's compute:\n\n8 * 3 = 24, write down 4, carryover 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carryover 2.\n\n3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11, write down 1, carryover 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carryover 0.\n\n6 * 3 = 18, write down 8, carryover 1.\n\nWait, no, the number is 62,783,758, so let me list the digits:\n\n6, 2, 7, 8, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, 62,783,758 is written as 6, 2, 7, 8, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reverse it for easier computation:\n\n8, 5, 7, 3, 8, 7, 2, 6.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, 62,783,758 * 3:\n\nFirst, 60,000,000 * 3 = 180,000,000.\n\n2,783,758 * 3: Let's compute 2,000,000*3=6,000,000.\n\n783,758*3: 700,000*3=2,100,000.\n\n83,758*3: 80,000*3=240,000, 3,758*3=11,274.\n\nSo 240,000 + 11,274 = 251,274.\n\nNow, 2,100,000 + 251,274 = 2,351,274.\n\nThen, 6,000,000 + 2,351,274 = 8,351,274.\n\nSo total is 180,000,000 + 8,351,274 = 188,351,274.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So 3*62,783,758=188,351,274.\n\nSo Step 9 is 188,351,274.\n\nWait, but let me check with the digit-by-digit method to be thorough.\n\nCompute 62,783,758 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 * 3 = 24 \u2192 write 4, carryover 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1.\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22 \u2192 write 2, carryover 2.\n\n3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 write 1, carryover 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write 5, carryover 2.\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 write 3, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\n6 * 3 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carryover 1.\n\nWait, but we're at the end, so we write 18 as 8 and carryover 1, but since there are no more digits, we write 1 before 8. So the result is 188,351,274. Yep, that's correct.\n\nStep 10: Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(Step 9's result)). So that's 3*(1 + 3*188,351,274). Let's compute that: 3*(1 + 565,053,822) = 3*565,053,823.\n\nFirst, compute 3*188,351,274: Let me compute that.\n\n188,351,274 * 3:\n\n100,000,000*3=300,000,000\n\n80,000,000*3=240,000,000\n\n8,000,000*3=24,000,000\n\n351,274*3: 300,000*3=900,000, 51,274*3=153,822.\n\nSo 300,000,000 + 240,000,000 = 540,000,000, +24,000,000=564,000,000, +900,000=564,900,000, +153,822=565,053,822.\n\nSo 3*188,351,274=565,053,822.\n\nThen, 565,053,822 + 1 = 565,053,823.\n\nNow, compute 3*565,053,823.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n500,000,000*3=1,500,000,000\n\n65,053,823*3: 60,000,000*3=180,000,000\n\n5,053,823*3: 5,000,000*3=15,000,000\n\n53,823*3: 50,000*3=150,000, 3,823*3=11,469.\n\nSo 180,000,000 + 15,000,000 = 195,000,000, +150,000=195,150,000, +11,469=195,161,469.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, compute 565,053,823 * 3:\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write 9, carryover 1.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 1 = 16 \u2192 write 6, carryover 1.\n\n0 * 3 = 0 + 1 = 1 \u2192 write 1, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n3 * 3 = 9 + 1 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carryover 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write 5, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\n3 * 3 = 9 \u2192 write 9.\n\nWait, but I think I might be getting confused with the digits. Let me write it out properly.\n\nWait, 565,053,823 is:\n\n5 (hundred millions), 6 (ten millions), 5 (millions), 0 (hundred thousands), 5 (ten thousands), 3 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 3 (units).\n\nSo multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write down 9, carryover 1.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 1 = 16 \u2192 write down 6, carryover 1.\n\n0 * 3 = 0 + 1 = 1 \u2192 write down 1, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n3 * 3 = 9 + 1 = 10 \u2192 write down 0, carryover 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 0.\n\n3 * 3 = 9 \u2192 write down 9.\n\nSo the result is 1,695,161,469.\n\nWait, let me check that. So starting from the right:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\n8 * 3 = 24 \u2192 4, carryover 2\n\n3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 1, carryover 1\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 1 = 16 \u2192 6, carryover 1\n\n0 * 3 = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 9, carryover 1\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 1 = 16 \u2192 6, carryover 1\n\nBut wait, we've reached the leftmost digit, so we write 1 before 6. So the number is 1,695,161,469.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 565,053,823 * 3:\n\n500,000,000 * 3 = 1,500,000,000\n\n60,000,000 * 3 = 180,000,000\n\n5,000,000 * 3 = 15,000,000\n\n0 * 3 = 0\n\n50,000 * 3 = 150,000\n\n3,000 * 3 = 9,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n1,500,000,000\n\n+180,000,000 = 1,680,000,000\n\n+15,000,000 = 1,695,000,000\n\n+0 = 1,695,000,000\n\n+150,000 = 1,695,150,000\n\n+9,000 = 1,695,159,000\n\n+2,400 = 1,695,161,400\n\n+60 = 1,695,161,460\n\n+9 = 1,695,161,469.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*565,053,823 = 1,695,161,469.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 1,695,161,469.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've correctly followed all the steps. So each step was computing the next layer, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let me recount the steps to ensure I didn't miss any.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39\n3. 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(118) = 354\n4. 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1063) = 3189\n5. 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(9568) = 28704\n6. 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(86113) = 258,339\n7. 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(775,018) = 2,325,324\n8. 3*(1 + 3*2,325,324) = 3*(6,975,973) = 20,927,919\n9. 3*(1 + 3*20,927,919) = 3*(62,783,758) = 188,351,274\n10. 3*(1 + 3*188,351,274) = 3*(565,053,823) = 1,695,161,469\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, how many layers are there? Let me check the original expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nCounting the number of 3(1+3(...) layers: starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nEach layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n...\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost (1+3).\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1+3*(...)) layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3(1+3...). So let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of 3(1+3(...)) layers. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, after the first 3, it's 1+3(...). Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and each time, the inner part is another 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1+3*(...)) layers. So the expression has 9 sets of 3*(1+3*(...)).\n\nWait, because starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to Step 10, which would be 10 layers. That might be the mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1+3), which is one layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) segments.\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3(1+3...). So starting from the first 3, each layer is a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1+3).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is (1+3), then each next layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and there are 9 such layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went from Step 1 to Step 10, which would be 10 layers. So perhaps I overcounted. Let me check.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1+3), which is Step 1. Then each layer after that is a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so for each of these, we have a step. Let me recount:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39\n3. 3*(1 + 3*39) = 354\n4. 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3189\n5. 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 28704\n6. 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 258,339\n7. 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 2,325,324\n8. 3*(1 + 3*2,325,324) = 20,927,919\n9. 3*(1 + 3*20,927,919) = 188,351,274\n10. 3*(1 + 3*188,351,274) = 1,695,161,469\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but the expression only has 9 layers. So perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) layers. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo starting from the innermost (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3*(1 + 3*(...)) appears.\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n...\nUp to the outermost.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost (1+3), we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + 3*("

It seems like a nested expression where each layer has a similar structure: 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order of operations, so innermost ones should be computed first.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nOkay, so starting from the innermost part, which is the very last (1 + 3).

Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the first 3, there's a 3*(1 + ...), and that happens 8 times after the first 3. Wait, no, perhaps I should count how many layers there are. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3). Then moving out, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let me think: starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 3*(1 + layer1). Layer 3 is 3*(1 + layer2), and so on until layer 9, which is the outermost. Wait, but when I look at the expression, how many times does this happen?\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nSo, step 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + result from step 1). Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then the next layer is 3*(1 + (1 + 3)). Wait, no, perhaps I should parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me number the layers from inside out as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). Wait, actually, let's see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine 3*(1 + ...) layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and moving outwards to the first layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider each layer as a function. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by writing down each layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check each step carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + Layer1). So,\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer:\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but that would mean the total expression is 36084. But let me check if I have the correct number of layers.\n\nWait, the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside a parenthesis. Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by a parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n- And this continues until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's see: each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is part of a 3*(1 + ...) structure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3s that are followed by a parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each time we have 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times this structure repeats.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n layers. In this case, how many layers do we have?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, there are 8 more 3*(1 + ...) structures. Wait, no, because each time we have a 3*(1 + ...), and the expression is nested 8 times after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as having 9 layers in total because each time we have a new layer, including the innermost one.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether to count the innermost (1 + 3) as a layer or not. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the first innermost expression, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 3*(1 + ...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, so according to this, the final result would be 36084. But let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each step is correct. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait a second, let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. Because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount.\n\nLet me try to count the number of times 3 is followed by a parenthesis:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside a parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s followed by a parenthesis.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, no, the innermost is just (1 + 3), not 3*(1 + 3). So, perhaps the number of layers is 8, not 9.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier count. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from whether the innermost (1 + 3) is a layer or not. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the initial 3, there's a 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) structures.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is 3*(1 + ...), then another 3*(1 + ...), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many 3*(1 + ...) are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each 3*(1 + ... starts with a 3 and then a parenthesis. So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next is 3*(1 + ...), which is the second layer. Then another 3*(1 + ...), which is the third layer, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...):\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))\n9. 3*(1 + 3)\n\nWait, so the innermost is just (1 + 3), not a 3*(1 + 3). So, perhaps the number of layers where 3*(1 + ...) is applied is 8, with the innermost being (1 + 3).\n\nWait, that would mean that my earlier calculation is incorrect because I considered 9 layers, but perhaps it's 8 layers.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nSo, if the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is Layer 2.\n\nThen Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nWait, so if there are 8 layers, then the final result is 12027, not 36084. Hmm, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me write the expression with all the parentheses expanded step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nExpression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me work from the inside out:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, we have 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nNow, the next layer would be 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total, including the innermost (1 + 3). So, perhaps my initial count was correct, and the final answer is 36084.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial 3 is considered a layer or not. Let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + ...), and inside that, there are 8 more 3*(1 + ...) layers, making a total of 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is that each time we add a layer, we're adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s in the expression, excluding the initial one. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach 3 is followed by a parenthesis except the last one, which is followed by a 3. So, how many 3s are followed by a parenthesis? Let me count:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on until the innermost 3 is followed by (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of 3s followed by a parenthesis is 8, because after 8 times, we reach the innermost (1 + 3), which doesn't have a 3*(...) anymore.\n\nWait, that would mean that the number of layers where we apply 3*(1 + ...) is 8, with the innermost being (1 + 3). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 8, with the innermost being (1 + 3). Therefore, the computation would be:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nSo, the final result would be 12027, which is Layer 8.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 8 more 3*(1 + ...) layers, making a total of 9 layers, including the innermost (1 + 3). Therefore, my initial calculation of 9 layers leading to 36084 is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nSo, if we have 9 terms, a_9 would be 36084, which would be the value of the original expression.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), up to a_9. So, the original expression is a_9, which is 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 36084.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe it's 8 layers, but with this sequence approach, it's clear that it's 9 layers, leading to 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the nth term of this sequence. Let's see, the recursive formula is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, let's find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 3\n\n-2*K = 3\n\nK = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3*C\n\nWhich is 11/2 = 3*C\n\nSo, C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2.\n\nSimplify further:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nNow, for n = 9, the value is:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nLet me compute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683.\n\nNow, compute 11*19683:\n\n11 * 19683 = Let me compute 10*19683 + 1*19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513.\n\nNow, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504.\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216,504 \u00f7 6.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 * 36,000 = 216,000.\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504.\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84.\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = 36,084.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation that the value of the original expression is 36,084.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that maybe the number of layers was 8, but according to this formula, it's 9 layers, which gives 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid now. I double-checked using both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both give the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be simplified by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(3 \\times (1 + \\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer sequentially, we find that the expression evaluates to 36,084.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \\(3 \\times (1 + \\text{inner expression})\\). The innermost expression is \\(1 + 3\\).\n\n2. **Compute from the Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\\)\n\n3. **Final Result:** After computing each layer up to the ninth layer, the final value is 36,084.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

It's a series of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together, each inside the next. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times that expression plus 1. Hmm, this seems like it might form some kind of pattern or perhaps a geometric series.\n\nLet me write it down more clearly to see the structure. Let's denote each level as a separate expression to make it manageable. Let's start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n- Level 1: (1 + 3)\n- Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n- Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n- Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3)\n- And so on, up to Level 9.\n\nWait, actually, counting the number of parentheses, it seems like there are 9 sets of parentheses, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and building up each layer.\n\nSo, maybe I should compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(...). So after computing Level 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24)\n\nCompute each part:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, that seems pretty large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe there's a formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each level manually, especially if there are more levels. Let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is defined as Level n = 1 + 3*(Level n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for this recursion.\n\nThe recursive formula is:\n\nLevel n = 1 + 3*(Level n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's write it as:\n\nLevel n - 3*(Level n-1) = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\nLevel n - 3*(Level n-1) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is Level n^(h) = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Level n^(p) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nLevel n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's say when n=1, Level 1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nLevel n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nLevel n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed levels.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nLevel 1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nLevel 2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nLevel 3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nLevel 4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nLevel 5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nLevel 6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nLevel 7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nLevel 8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\nLevel 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works. So, for Level n, it's (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Level 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: the original problem is 3*(...), where the innermost part is (1+3). So, the outermost multiplication is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, yes, that is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the entire expression as a single recurrence, but since we've already broken it down, and the formula checks out, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after computing each level step by step, verifying with a formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by defining each level of the nested expression and compute it step by step:\n\n- Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Level 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nTo verify, we use the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation. The general formula for Level \\(n\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Level } n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor Level 9:\n\n\\[ \\text{Level 9} = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try to visualize this structure.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(result from above). Wait, let me check the structure again. Each level seems to be 1 plus 3 times the next level. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, counting the number of opening parentheses, it's nine, so maybe nine levels. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should index them differently. Let me try numbering from the inside out.\n\nLet me think of each opening parenthesis as a new level, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Then, moving one level out, we have another (1 + 3*(Level 1)). So that's 1 + 3*(4). Let's compute that.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next level out: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Finally, the outermost level: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the problem is 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is Level 9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times the result of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I considered the innermost as Level 1, then each subsequent level up to Level 9, which would be the expression inside the outermost parentheses before multiplying by 3. So perhaps I should compute that expression first and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, let me recount. Each time, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each level is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), but I'm not sure if I'm accounting for the 3 correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in how I structured the levels.\n\nLet me try again, perhaps more carefully.\n\nLet me write out each step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, keeping track of each level.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one level, we have (1 + 3*(innermost result)).\n\nSo that would be (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, moving out another level: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext level: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this value: 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me confirm by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps when computing the inner levels. Sometimes, when you have multiple nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount the levels or miscalculate a step.\n\nLet me recount the levels:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next level: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's nine levels, each time computing (1 + 3*previous result). So that seems correct.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nHmm, but let me think again: the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the expression inside is 29524, and then multiplied by 3. So yes, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this using another approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, this seems similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as such.\n\nEach level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So, starting from 1, each time you add 3 times the previous value.\n\nWait, but let me think about it: if I denote a_n as the value at each level, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but perhaps this can be represented as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but that's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation a_n = 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u2192 -2*a_p = 1 \u2192 a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9 levels, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by expanding each level. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each level is building up a geometric progression.\n\nBut I think the method I used is solid, and the formula approach confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

Let me try that.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the entire expression would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Hmm, let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, just to confirm.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier for layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence relation approach, let me check for a smaller n. Let's take n=1, a_1 should be 4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 should be 13. The formula gives (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3, a_3=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4, a_4=121. Formula: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the first few layers, so it's likely correct for layer 9 as well.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, we find the result to be 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

It seems like there's a repeating pattern here, so maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to parse this expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That's simple enough: 1 + 3 is 4. So the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 multiplied by something. Wait, no, let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, let me try to substitute the innermost first.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. So:\n\n- L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- L2: 1 + 3*L1\n- L3: 1 + 3*L2\n- And so on, until L9, since there are nine layers in total, each multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer, which is L9. So, let me write this step by step.\n\nLet me list each layer from L1 to L9:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so let's count:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 L1\n2. 3(1 + 3) \u2192 L2\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) \u2192 L3\n4. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2192 L4\n5. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) \u2192 L5\n6. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) \u2192 L6\n7. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2192 L7\n8. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) \u2192 L8\n9. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) \u2192 L9\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by L9, so the total expression is 3*(L9). So, L9 is 1 + 3*L8, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculation by stopping at L9 and then multiplying by 3 again. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in my initial calculation, I went up to L9 as 1 + 3*L8, which is correct, but then the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, if L9 is 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. But let me check if I correctly calculated each layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the layers. Let me go through each step again carefully.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n________\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 L1\n\nThen each subsequent layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)), so from L1 to L9, each layer is built by adding 1 and 3 times the previous layer.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is L9, which is 1 + 3*L8, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed L9 as 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572. So, is that the final answer?\n\nWait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nL6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nL7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nL8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, L9 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147\n\nThus, 3*L9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way outwards.

There are nine sets of parentheses, so I think I need to work from the innermost one outwards. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: \n\nFirst, the innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).

Wait, no, that's not correct because in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + inner layer). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + (1 + 3)).\n\nWait, perhaps I should write each step as:\n\nCompute from the inside out, each time computing the innermost expression first.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, perhaps I should label each step as follows:\n\nLet me think of the entire expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) becomes 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the innermost ... is 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time computing the value of that layer and substituting it into the next outer layer.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nCompute L1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, compute L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, no, because each layer is 3*(1 + inner layer). So L2 would be 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, L3 would be 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + next inner layer). So starting from L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, L3 is 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nSimilarly, L4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So that's nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). So starting from L1 as (1+3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So yes, that would be 9 layers, so L1 to L9, each computed as 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nWait, but in my calculation above, I started with L1 = 4, then L2 = 15, L3 = 48, etc., up to L9 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each 3*(1 + ...) is another layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because each layer is 3*(1 + inner layer). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many times does the pattern 3*(1 + ... ) occur? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the innermost, then each step out adds another 3*(1 + ...). So starting from (1 + 3), then 3*(1 + that), then 3*(1 + that), etc., up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time computing the value of that layer and substituting it into the next outer layer.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Now, moving out one layer, we have 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nStep 3: Next layer out is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nStep 5: Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nStep 6: Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nStep 7: Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nStep 8: Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nStep 9: Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, that's 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), because the innermost is (1 + 3), then each 3*(1 + ...) is another layer. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the innermost, then 3*(1 + (1 + 3)) is the next layer, which is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, that's 8 layers after the innermost (1 + 3). So total layers would be 9, starting from (1 + 3) as layer 1, then 8 more layers. So the final result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each layer out is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), which can be represented recursively. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nYes, so that's consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me try to see if this sequence follows a pattern. Let me list the a_n values:\n\na_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 15.\n\na_3 = 48.\n\na_4 = 147.\n\na_5 = 444.\n\na_6 = 1335.\n\na_7 = 4008.\n\na_8 = 12027.\n\na_9 = 36084.\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term seems to be 3 times the previous term plus 3.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\na_2 = 3*a_1 + 3? 3*4 + 3 = 15, yes.\n\na_3 = 3*a_2 + 3? 3*15 + 3 = 48, yes.\n\na_4 = 3*a_3 + 3? 3*48 + 3 = 147, yes.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nCharacteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 \u21d2 r = 3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3 \u21d2 C - 3C = 3 \u21d2 -2C = 3 \u21d2 C = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 3/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 \u21d2 A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*(3^n).\n\nAlternatively, 3^n = 3*3^{n-1}, so maybe we can write it differently, but perhaps it's fine as is.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5.\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute:\n\n3280 * 11 = 36,080.\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5.\n\nSo total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result of 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, I computed each subsequent layer by multiplying by 3 after adding 1, and after 9 layers, I arrived at 36,084. Additionally, using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I also arrived at the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the result of the inner layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outwards, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 after adding 1. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 36,084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " Compute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It seems like there are multiple layers of expressions inside each other. Let me try to visualize this. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 plus another expression). So it's like a chain of operations. Maybe I can solve it from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually seems to work with these kinds of problems.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the parentheses, the innermost one is (1 + 3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, so that part is straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe structure is 3(1 + ...). So the first layer would be 3 times (1 + something). The something is the next inner expression. Let me see how many layers there are. Counting the number of 3s outside the parentheses, I think there are nine 3s. So, nine layers in total. That means I'll have to compute this nine times, each time substituting the innermost part first.\n\nLet me write down each step methodically.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3(1 + 3) = 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, the next layer: 3(1 + result from step 2)\n4. Continue this process until all layers are computed.\n\nSo, let's go step by step.\n\nStep 1: Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, hold on. Actually, the next layer is 3*(1 + result from step 1). So, in step 2, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Hmm, maybe I confused the structure. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer:\n\n2. The next expression is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, but in the structure, it's 3*(1 + [next layer]). So, perhaps I need to think of each step as 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, maybe I should label each step as Layer 1, Layer 2, up to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I did each step correctly.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let me compute 1336*3: 1336*3 is 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute that: 4000*3 = 12000, 9*3=27, so total is 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute that: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so total is 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36084. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me verify if I didn't make a mistake in any step, especially the multiplication.\n\nLet me recompute some steps:\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let's compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So, 300+120=420, 420+24=444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. 1200+120=1320, 1320+15=1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So, 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So, 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So, 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nAlright, so each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 36084.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure: Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value at layer n, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + L_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + L_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1})\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence in terms of L_n:\n\nL_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C\n\nThus, C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nWait, let me compute it as is:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nLet me compute L_9 using this formula.\n\nL_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683\n\nThus,\n\nL_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 / 6:\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, multiply by 11:\n\n3280.5 * 11\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3280 * 11 = 36,080\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo, total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nSo, L_9 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. That's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid. Just to make sure, I'll try computing a couple more layers manually to see if the pattern holds.\n\nLet's compute Layer 7 using the formula:\n\nL_7 = (11/6)*3^7 - 3/2\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\nSo,\n\nL_7 = (11/6)*2187 - 1.5\n\nCompute 2187 / 6:\n\n2187 \u00f7 6 = 364.5\n\nMultiply by 11:\n\n364.5 * 11\n\n364 * 11 = 4,004\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nTotal: 4,004 + 5.5 = 4,009.5\n\nSubtract 1.5:\n\n4,009.5 - 1.5 = 4,008\n\nWhich matches Layer 7's result from earlier. Good.\n\nAnother check: Layer 5.\n\nL_5 = (11/6)*3^5 - 3/2\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n243 / 6 = 40.5\n\n40.5 * 11 = 445.5\n\n445.5 - 1.5 = 444\n\nWhich is correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost. The innermost layer is:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\nNext, we compute each subsequent layer using the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 3(1 + L_{n-1}) \\):\n\n2. \\( L_2 = 3(1 + L_1) = 3(1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 3(1 + L_2) = 3(1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 3(1 + L_3) = 3(1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 3(1 + L_4) = 3(1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 3(1 + L_5) = 3(1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 3(1 + L_6) = 3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 3(1 + L_7) = 3(1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 3(1 + L_8) = 3(1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, I see that the innermost part is (1+3). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next layer: 1+3(...)\n3. Then another layer: 1+3(...)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer is 3 times that entire expression.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time, it's 3 times (1 plus something). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 3s outside. Wait, maybe it's easier to see how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s multiplied by the expressions:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer)\n3. So, each time, we have a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1+3)\n3. 3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of 3s. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but let me check that. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, L10, since I think there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s. Each layer is 3*(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1: L1 = 1+3 = 4\n- Then, moving out, layer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n- Layer 10: L10 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but the outermost layer is 3*(L10), right? Because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after L10, we have the outermost 3 multiplied by L10.\n\nWait, no, let me check. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's L1=4.\n\nThen, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nL10 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L10) = 3*88573 = ?\n\nWait, but let me confirm how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nLooking at the expression, the first part is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 L1 = 4\n2. 3*(1 + L1) \u2192 L2 = 3*(1+4) = 15? Wait, no, wait, L2 is 1 + 3*L1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer10) = 3*88573.\n\nWait, so that would be 3*88573.\n\nCalculating that: 88573 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n88573 * 3:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, carry over 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26.\n\nWait, that seems off. Wait, let me write it properly:\n\n88573\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\n\nWait, but there's no more digits, so we write down the 26 as 26.\n\nWait, but 88573 * 3:\n\nLet me compute:\n\n88573 \u00d7 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21 \u2192 1, carry 2\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carry 1\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 5, carry 2\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26 \u2192 6, carry 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we add the carry 2 in front.\n\nSo, 265719.\n\nWait, that seems correct?\n\nWait, 88573 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me check with another method:\n\n88573 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 80,000 \u00d7 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 \u00d7 3 = 24,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n70 \u00d7 3 = 210\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\nAdding them up:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nYes, so 88573 \u00d7 3 = 265,719.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I correctly counted the layers. The original expression has how many layers?\n\nLooking back at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Each time you have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + ...)\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another 3 inside\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see that the number of layers is 9, because each time after the initial 3, there are 9 more layers.\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first parenthesis after the initial 3 is (1+3(...)). Then, each time, we have another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(...)) \u2192 that's one opening parenthesis.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...)) \u2192 second opening parenthesis.\n\nContinuing this way, let's see:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. (1+3(...)) \u2192 1\n2. Then another (1+3(...)) \u2192 2\n3. Then another \u2192 3\n4. \u21924\n5. \u21925\n6. \u21926\n7. \u21927\n8. \u21928\n9. \u21929\n10. \u219210\n\nWait, that can't be right because the expression ends with (1+3(1+3(...))).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3*(1 + ...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. Then 3*(1 + layer1) \u2192 layer2\n3. Then 3*(1 + layer2) \u2192 layer3\n... and so on.\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is layer1, then layer2 up to layer9, and then the outermost 3*(layer9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to layer10 and then multiplied by 3 again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nLet me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer1:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, so that would be 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n3 \u00d7 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I had Layer10 as 88573. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) \u2192 Layer1 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer1) \u2192 Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2192 Layer3\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2192 Layer4\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2192 Layer5\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2192 Layer6\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2192 Layer7\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2192 Layer8\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2192 Layer9\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's different from my earlier calculation where I had 3*88573. So, where did I go wrong before?\n\nI think I miscounted the layers. Let me check the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...). Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of 3s in the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nWait, no, that's not right because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer2 = 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3 = 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that makes sense. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 10 layers, but that was incorrect. It's actually 9 layers inside the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize the expression with brackets.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively.\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f(n) = A*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2713\n\nn=2: f(2)= (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2713\n\nn=3: f(3)= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2713\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2\n\nWait, because f(n) is defined as the value after n layers. So, if we have 9 layers inside the initial 3, then the value inside is f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n3^11 is 177147\n\nSo, 3^11 -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144\n\nThen, 177144 /2 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully working through each layer and verifying with a formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer step by step. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each subsequent layer until the outermost layer is reached. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Start from the Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation**:\n   - The recurrence \\(f(n) = 1 + 3f(n-1)\\) with \\(f(1) = 4\\) leads to the formula \\(f(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n   - For \\(n = 9\\), \\(f(9) = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try to visualize this structure. Each layer seems to be of the form 3*(1 + something), where the something is another similar expression. So, maybe if I compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside, I can simplify this expression step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step as I go along. I'll start from the innermost part, which is 1+3, then move outwards each time. So, let's see:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one layer out, I have 3*(result from step 1).\n3. Then, the next layer is (1 + result from step 2), and so on.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me count how many layers there are. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, there are nine layers of nesting. That means I need to compute this from the innermost layer (layer 9) up to the outermost layer (layer 1). Let me try to index them as layers 1 through 9, with layer 1 being the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. The innermost part is the last (1+3), which is layer 9. Then each step moving outward is layer 8, 7, etc., up to layer 1, which is the outermost. So, I should compute layer 9 first, then layer 8, up to layer 1.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3)\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 9 result)\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 8 result)\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 7 result)\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 6 result)\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 5 result)\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 4 result)\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 3 result)\nLayer 1: (1 + Layer 2 result)\nFinal result: 3*(Layer 1 result)\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*(1 + something). Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, the innermost layer is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result). So, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward, each time computing the value of the current layer as 3*(1 + next layer's value).\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's number the layers from inside out as layers 1 to 9.\n\nWait, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is the last part. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. It's nine opening parentheses, each followed by a 1 + 3(...). So, each of those is a layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, I need to compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me try to structure this as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1)\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3)\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5)\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7)\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8)\nLayer 10: 3*(1 + Layer 9)\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps the outermost is 3*(1 + something). So, perhaps the outermost layer is 3*(1 + Layer 9), where Layer 9 is the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each step step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write each step as I compute it:\n\nStart with the innermost expression:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost part we just computed is 4. So, the next layer is:\n\nStep 2: Compute 3*(1 + 3*(innermost result)) = 3*(1 + 3*4).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the next layer is 3*(1 + the result from Step 1). Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Wait, no, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + the result of the inner layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but I think I'm missing a step here. Because each layer is 3*(1 + inner expression). So, perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me try to write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to index the layers from inside out as layers 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 3*(1 + layer 1), layer 3 is 3*(1 + layer 2), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the outermost is layer 9, and the final result is 3*(layer 9). Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but then the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(1 + Layer 9). Wait, no, because in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), where ... is the entire inner expression. So, if Layer 9 is the innermost, then moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, perhaps I need to compute up to Layer 9 and then multiply by 3 again.\n\nWait, no, let me check the structure again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is 3*(1 + ...), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, as I did before.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which was 36084, but the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), so perhaps the final result is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me try to recount how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are nine instances of (1 + 3(...)). So, each of these is a layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me list each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*(1 + Layer 9). Wait, no, because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(1 + Layer 9). So, the final result is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085.\n\nLet me compute that: 36085 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 36085 * 3:\n\n36085 * 3:\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n0 * 3 = 0 + 2 = 2, write down 2.\n\n6 * 3 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n3 * 3 = 9 + 1 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\nNo more digits, so write down the 1.\n\nSo, 36085 * 3 = 108255.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought that Layer 9 was 36084, which would make the final result 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation for Layer 9 again. 1 + 12027 is 12028, and 3*12028.\n\nLet me compute 12028 * 3:\n\n8*3=24, write down 4, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 + 2=8, write down 8.\n\n0*3=0.\n\n2*3=6.\n\n1*3=3.\n\nSo, 12028 * 3 = 36084. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085.\n\nCompute 36085 * 3:\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n0*3=0 +2=2, write down 2.\n\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n3*3=9 +1=10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 1.\n\nSo, 36085*3=108255.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), so the ... is the entire inner expression, which after computing up to Layer 9, gives 36084. So, 1 + 36084 is 36085, and 3*36085 is indeed 108255.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, with nine layers inside, each time we compute 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from (1+3)=4, then 3*(1+4)=15, then 3*(1+15)=48, and so on, up to nine layers. So, Layer 9 is 36084, and then the outermost 3*(1 + 36084) is 3*36085=108255.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, but since the number of layers is manageable, doing it step by step is feasible.\n\nWait, let me see if I can find a pattern in the results.\n\nLooking at the results from each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 15\n\nLayer 3: 48\n\nLayer 4: 147\n\nLayer 5: 444\n\nLayer 6: 1335\n\nLayer 7: 4008\n\nLayer 8: 12027\n\nLayer 9: 36084\n\nI notice that each result is 3*(previous result +1). So, starting from 4, each next layer is 3*(previous +1). So, 4, 15, 48, etc.\n\nWait, 4: Layer 1.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4 + 1) = 3*5=15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(15 +1)=3*16=48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(48 +1)=3*49=147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(147 +1)=3*148=444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(444 +1)=3*445=1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1335 +1)=3*1336=4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(4008 +1)=3*4009=12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(12027 +1)=3*12028=36084.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each layer is 3*(previous layer's result +1).\n\nSo, with that in mind, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4.\n\na_{n} = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1) for n=2 to 9.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*(a_9 +1).\n\nWait, but in our case, the original expression is 3*(1 + a_9), where a_9 is the innermost expression after nine layers. So, yes, that would be 3*(1 + a_9).\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, a_9 was 36084, so 3*(1 + 36084)=108255.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 3*(a_{n-1} +1), with a_1=4.\n\nLet me compute a few terms:\n\na_1=4.\n\na_2=3*(4+1)=15.\n\na_3=3*(15+1)=48.\n\na_4=3*(48+1)=147.\n\na_5=3*(147+1)=444.\n\na_6=3*(444+1)=1335.\n\na_7=3*(1335+1)=4008.\n\na_8=3*(4008+1)=12027.\n\na_9=3*(12027+1)=36084.\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nWait, because a_n = 3*(a_{n-1} +1) = 3*a_{n-1} +3.\n\nYes, so this is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +3, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssuming a_p is a constant, substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p +3.\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 3 => -2*a_p=3 => a_p= -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 3/2.\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3A => 11/2 = 3A => A=11/(2*3)=11/6.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1}) - 3/2.\n\nWait, because 3^n = 3*3^{n-1}, so (11/6)*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6 = 11*3^{n-1}/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} -3)/2 = (11*1 -3)/2 = (8)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11*3^{1} -3)/2=(33 -3)/2=30/2=15. Correct.\n\nn=3: (11*9 -3)/2=(99-3)/2=96/2=48. Correct.\n\nn=4: (11*27 -3)/2=(297-3)/2=294/2=147. Correct.\n\nn=5: (11*81 -3)/2=(891-3)/2=888/2=444. Correct.\n\nn=6: (11*243 -3)/2=(2673 -3)/2=2670/2=1335. Correct.\n\nn=7: (11*729 -3)/2=(8019 -3)/2=8016/2=4008. Correct.\n\nn=8: (11*2187 -3)/2=(24057 -3)/2=24054/2=12027. Correct.\n\nn=9: (11*6561 -3)/2=(72171 -3)/2=72168/2=36084. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} -3)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^{8} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 -3)/2 = (72171 -3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, the final result is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + (11*3^8 -3)/2) = 3*( (2 + 11*6561 -3)/2 ) = 3*( (11*6561 -1)/2 ).\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n11*6561 = 72171.\n\n72171 -1 = 72170.\n\n72170/2 = 36085.\n\n3*36085 = 108255. Correct.\n\nSo, either way, the result is 108255.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I computed each layer step by step, I ended up with 108255, and using the formula, I also got 108255, so that seems consistent.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, let me recompute a few layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4 +1) = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(15 +1) = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(48 +1) = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(147 +1) = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(444 +1) = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1335 +1) = 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(4008 +1) = 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(12027 +1) = 36084. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nYes, all steps check out. I think I can be confident that the result is 108255.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{108255}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335 \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008 \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027 \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084 \\]\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times (1 + 36084) = 3 \\times 36085 = 108255 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{108255}\n\\]"

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It seems like each part is similar, so maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to parse this expression properly.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of terms where each term is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). It's like a chain of operations.\n\nLet me write this out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That might make it easier to handle.\n\nLet's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since there are nine layers in total.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression, the innermost part is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), and the innermost is (1+3). Let me count the number of 3s: 3, then 3, then 3, etc. I think there are nine 3s multiplied, but let me check.\n\nWait, actually, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + (1 + 3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this more systematically. Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let me try to break it down:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by this entire structure. So after computing Layer9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 sets of parentheses, meaning 9 layers. So my earlier calculation up to Layer9 is correct, and then the final result is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I calculated Layer9 as 29524, so then the total expression would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but actually, it's 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"3(\" starts a new layer, so:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression is structured differently. Let me try to write it step by step, layer by layer, ensuring I'm not making a mistake.\n\nLet me define each step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Next layer: 3*(1 + Step1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, wait a second, in my initial approach, I thought Layer2 was 1 + 3*Layer1, but now I'm seeing that perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify the structure.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, that's a different result than before. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I misapplied the layers. In my initial approach, I considered each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer), but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the structure is 3*(1 + ...), not 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, let me correct that.\n\nLet me redefine the layers properly, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, that's a different result. So, my initial approach was incorrect because I misapplied the structure. I thought each layer was 1 + 3*(previous), but it's actually 3*(1 + previous).\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost (1+3)=4.\n\nLet me verify this step-by-step again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nLet me compute 3*36084:\n\n36084 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25 \u2192 5, carryover 2\n\n0*3=0 +2=2\n\n6*3=18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\n3*3=9 +1=10 \u2192 0, carryover 1\n\nSo, writing it down: 108252.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. 36084 * 3:\n\n36084 + 36084 = 72168\n\n72168 + 36084 = 108252.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 108252.\n\nI think my initial mistake was in how I structured the layers. I had considered each layer as 1 + 3*(previous), but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from (1+3)=4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), which leads to a different result.\n\nLet me just go through the layers again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3*36084 = 108252 \u2192 Correct.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the final answer is 108252.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the previous layer).

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, okay, so it's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). It seems like there are multiple layers here, so I think I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each layer is similar: 3 times (1 plus something). So, maybe I can compute each innermost part first and then substitute it into the outer layers.\n\nLet's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, I see nine opening parentheses, so that means there are nine layers here. Wait, actually, each layer is a multiplication by 3, so let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\n3. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should label each layer as Layer 1, Layer 2, up to Layer 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because if Layer 1 is (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).

So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + the next inner layer).\n\nSo, perhaps I should start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly because the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count the number of times I see \"3(\".\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers, each being 3*(1 + next layer). So, I think I computed up to Layer 9 correctly, resulting in 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step seems correct. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nGiven that, and knowing that L_1 = 4, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me write down the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nFirst, let's write out the first few terms to see if we can spot a pattern.\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, so each term is 3 times (1 plus the previous term). Let's see if we can express this recurrence in a more general way.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1})\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nL_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and then finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 3\n\n-2*A = 3\n\nA = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 1.5\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3*C\n\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 1/2:\n\nL_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nSo, L_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, we can compute L_9 as:\n\nL_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9 first:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683\n\nNow, plug into the formula:\n\nL_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\nFirst, 10*19683 = 196,830\n\nThen, add 1*19683 = 19,683\n\nSo, 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513\n\nNow, subtract 9:\n\n216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n216,504 / 6\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n6 goes into 21 six times (6*3=18), remainder 3. Bring down 6: 36\n\n6 goes into 36 six times. Bring down 5: 05\n\n6 goes into 5 zero times, remainder 5. Bring down 0: 50\n\n6 goes into 50 eight times (6*8=48), remainder 2. Bring down 4: 24\n\n6 goes into 24 four times. No remainder.\n\nSo, 216,504 / 6 = 36,084\n\nSo, L_9 = 36,084, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, derived a general formula, and confirmed that both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 36,084 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the result of the next inner layer). Using a step-by-step approach or a derived formula, the final result is found to be 36,084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

It seems like each part is a similar expression, so maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit instead of computing each one individually. Hmm.\n\nLet me write it out more clearly to see the structure. Starting from the innermost part:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? So that's 4. Then moving one step out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write this step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as A\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then the next layer would be A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081, and so on, up to A\u2089, since there are nine layers of parentheses. Finally, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089.\n\nSo, step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way:\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check that. Because when I got to A\u2089, I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go through each step again to make sure.\n\nStarting over:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So A\u2086 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So A\u2087 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then A\u2088 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nNow A\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So A\u2089 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct.\n\nSo now, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this multiplication another way. Maybe using another method to avoid mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing A\u2089. Because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of steps.\n\nLet me recount the number of parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let's see: Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and the expression starts with 3(...). So the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3\n10. )))))))))))\n\nWait, actually, perhaps it's 9 layers because each \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3 is one layer, and there are 9 such layers before the innermost 1 + 3. So maybe I only have 9 layers, so A\u2081 through A\u2089, as I originally thought.\n\nWait, but when I did the computation, I had A\u2081 to A\u2089, each being 1 + 3*A_previous, leading up to A\u2089 = 29524, then 3*A\u2089 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check the number of layers again to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) (Layer 3)\n...\nContinuing until Layer 9, which would be the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo yes, that's 9 layers, so A\u2081 to A\u2089.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I got A\u2089 = 29524, then 3*A\u2089 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm the final multiplication once more.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute this using another method, like breaking down 29524 into parts.\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

So, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3)\nThen, moving out: 3*(1 + 3*(innermost))\nThen another layer: 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer))\nAnd this continues until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, the first ( is at position 2. Then each 3 inside starts a new parenthesis. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first ( is after 3.\n   - Then inside, another ( after 1+3.\n   - This continues until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after the initial 3, each time we have another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each layer is one more. Let me count the number of times I can go inwards:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 2 layers\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, actually, each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 1 layer. Then, moving out, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many such layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the first one. Wait, maybe it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, then each 3 inside starts another (. Let me count the number of (:\n\n1. The first ( after 3: that's one.\n2. Then inside that, another ( after 1+3: that's two.\n3. Continuing this way, each time I see a new (, it's a new layer.\n\nWait, but actually, each time I have a 3 followed by a (, it's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the first ( is the first layer. Then, inside that, the next ( is the second layer, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, let's count the number of layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\n- Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- ...\n- Layer 9: 3*(1 + 3)\n\nWait, because from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 9, and each layer above adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, let me check: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then, moving outwards, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n- The first ( after 3: that's Layer 1.\n- Then inside, another ( after 1+3: Layer 2.\n- This continues until the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 9.\n\nSo, total of 9 layers. Therefore, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))).\n\nSo, to compute this, I can start from the innermost layer and work my way outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is computed as 3*(1 + previous term).\n\nWait, actually, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3), then moving outwards.\n\nLet me denote the innermost as L1, then the next layer as L2, and so on until L9, which is the outermost layer multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but actually, the outermost layer is 3*(L9), where L9 is (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute from the innermost and work outwards.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The outermost layer is 3*(L9). Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the 9 layers. So, after computing L9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm the structure. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is L1 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*L_prev.\n\nSo, L1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check: the expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, but in our definition, L9 is already 1 + 3*L8, which is 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n24*3 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 at the innermost.\n\nThen, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, no: the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nThus, the value is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo, either way, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by computing each layer step by step and by solving the recurrence relation, which gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:  \n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses and 3s. Let me see if I can figure this out. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting confused.\n\nSo, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is \"1+3\". That seems straightforward. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, I see that this result is multiplied by 3. So the next step is to compute 3 times that 4. Let me write that:\n\nNext level: 3 * 4 = 12\n\nOkay, so now that I have 12, I need to add 1 to it because the next expression is 1 + (result from previous step). So:\n\nNext level: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving out another level, this 13 is multiplied by 3 again. So:\n\nNext level: 3 * 13 = 39\n\nNow, adding 1 to this result:\n\nNext level: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so far, each time I'm doing 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me see if this pattern continues. The next step would be multiplying 40 by 3:\n\nNext level: 3 * 40 = 120\n\nThen adding 1:\n\nNext level: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nContinuing this pattern, multiply by 3:\n\nNext level: 3 * 121 = 363\n\nAdd 1:\n\nNext level: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nNext level: 3 * 364 = 1092\n\nAdd 1:\n\nNext level: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nNext level: 3 * 1093 = 3279\n\nAdd 1:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait a minute, let me check how many times I did this. Each time, I'm moving out one level, right? Let's count the number of operations. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one level, and each subsequent multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 is another level. Let me count the number of parentheses. Hmm, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a level. Let's see: starting from the innermost, I have 1+3, then each subsequent level adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression, I see that after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)), and this pattern repeats. Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each time, there's a closing parenthesis after each 3. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then it's multiplied by 3, and then another (1+3(...))\n- So, each time, we have a new (1+3(...)) until we reach the outermost 3(...).\n\nLet me count the number of times the pattern (1+3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted. Let me try a different approach. Each time I encounter a new opening parenthesis, that's a new level. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The first (1+3) is level 1.\n2. Then, moving out, each (1+3(...) is level 2, 3, etc.\n\nBut actually, looking at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (...))).\n\nSo, the structure is like this:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (...))))\n\nEach time, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each outer layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 8 layers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer.\n\nLet's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( is another layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each ( is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 8 opening parentheses after the first 3. But each of these corresponds to a layer, right? So that would mean there are 8 layers of 1+3*(...). But let me check the exact structure.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each outer layer is (1+3*(...)), so each ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, the first ( is at the start of the first inner expression: (1+3(...))\n\nThen, inside that, another (, and so on.\n\nSo, the number of ( after the first 3 is 8. Therefore, there are 8 layers of 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...).\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I only did 8 steps, but maybe I missed something. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me write down each step with the corresponding layer number.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3 * Layer1 + 1? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3*(Layer8). So after computing Layer8, which is 9841, we then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, final result: 3 * 9841 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n3 * 9841:\n\nFirst, 3 * 9000 = 27,000\n\n3 * 800 = 2,400\n\n3 * 40 = 120\n\n3 * 1 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo, the final result is 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. I think I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1+3) is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each (1+3*(...)) is another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3*(...)) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer1\n2. (1+3*(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer2\n3. (1+3*(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer3\n4. (1+3*(Layer3)) \u2192 Layer4\n5. (1+3*(Layer4)) \u2192 Layer5\n6. (1+3*(Layer5)) \u2192 Layer6\n7. (1+3*(Layer6)) \u2192 Layer7\n8. (1+3*(Layer7)) \u2192 Layer8\n9. (1+3*(Layer8)) \u2192 Layer9\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers, not 8. Because each time we add another (1+3*(...)), starting from Layer1 up to Layer9, and then the outermost 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier by stopping at Layer8, but actually, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, let me recount, properly this time.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, if Layer8 is 9841, then Layer9 would be 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nBut then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me compute that.\n\n3*29524:\n\n3*20000 = 60,000\n\n3*9000 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 Total: 88,572\n\nWait, but 3*29524 is actually 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n________\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 29,523, but that was before considering the outermost 3. So, actually, after computing Layer9 as 29,524, the outermost 3*(Layer9) is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6.

So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer8), not Layer9. So, perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: the innermost is Layer1: (1+3) =4.\n\nThen Layer2: 3*(Layer1) +1? Wait no, the structure is 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(LayerN), where LayerN is 1 + 3*(LayerN-1).\n\nSo, starting from Layer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(Layer4)=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(Layer5)=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(Layer6)=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(Layer7)=1+9840=9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer8)=3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 8 layers inside, leading to Layer8, and then 3*Layer8=29523.\n\nBut in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of layers inside the outermost 3 is 8, right? Because starting from (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)), and there are 8 such layers before the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but when I count the number of ( after the first 3, I get 8. So, that would mean 8 layers inside, so Layer1 to Layer8, and then 3*Layer8.\n\nSo, let's recount with 8 layers:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought there were 9 layers, I got 88,572, but that seems too high. So, I must have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nLet me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is (1+3*(...)), and the number of such layers is 8, because after the first 3, there are 8 sets of (1+3*(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of (1+3*(...)) expressions inside the outermost 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that's 8 layers. So, each layer adds another (1+3*(...)), and the outermost is 3*(Layer8). So, Layer8 is 9841, and 3*9841=29,523.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me compute Layer8 again step by step to make sure.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*9841=29,523.\n\nWait, but let me compute 9841*3 again to make sure.\n\n9841 *3:\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n800*3=2,400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400=29,400\n\n29,400 + 120=29,520\n\n29,520 +3=29,523\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 9 layers, but that was a mistake. The correct number is 8 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), leading to 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me check again the original expression to make sure.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)), and the number of such layers is 8, because each ( after the first 3 adds a new layer.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is up to Layer8, which gives 9841, and then 3*9841=29,523.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me try computing the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1+3=4\n\nNext layer:1+3*(4)=1+12=13\n\nNext:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nNext:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nNext:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nNext:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nNext:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nNext:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(9841)=29,523.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me compute the expression from the innermost to the outermost, step by step, ensuring I don't miss any layers.\n\nInnermost: (1+3)=4\n\nNext: (1+3*4)=13\n\nNext: (1+3*13)=40\n\nNext: (1+3*40)=121\n\nNext: (1+3*121)=364\n\nNext: (1+3*364)=1093\n\nNext: (1+3*1093)=3280\n\nNext: (1+3*3280)=9841\n\nOutermost: 3*9841=29,523\n\nYes, that's 8 layers inside, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), leading to 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29,523.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 29,523.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer as we go.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Outermost Layer**:  \n   \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\)\n\n**Final Answer**:  \n\\(\\boxed{29523}\\)"

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure out how to approach this. It seems like each part of the expression is similar, so maybe there's a pattern or a way to simplify it by working from the inside out.\n\nAlright, so let's start by looking at the innermost part of the expression and work our way outward. That usually works well with nested parentheses. The innermost part here is \"1+3\". Let me write that down:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that part, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(result from step 1). Let me write that:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. 3*(4) is 12, and 1 + 12 is indeed 13. Okay, moving on.\n\nNow, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So:\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems correct. Let me keep going.\n\nNext, the layer out from there is 1 + 3*(result from step 3):\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, that's correct.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 4):\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So far, so good.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 5):\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nMoving on, next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 6):\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. That seems right.\n\nNext, the layer out from there is 1 + 3*(result from step 7):\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 8):\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nHmm, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That's correct.\n\nNow, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from step 9):\n\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. That seems right.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 10):\n\n11. Outermost layer: 3*(88573) = 265719\n\nWait, 3*88573. Let me compute that carefully. 88573 * 3:\n\n- 3*3 is 9, carryover 0.\n- 3*7 is 21, write down 1, carryover 2.\n- 3*5 is 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n- 3*8 is 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n- 3*8 is 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carryover 2.\n- Since there are no more digits, write down the carryover 2.\n\nWait, that gives me 265719. Let me check with another method. 88573 * 3:\n\n- 80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n- 8,000 * 3 = 24,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 70 * 3 = 210\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n\nAdding them up:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*88573 is indeed 265,719.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I thought 3*29524 is 88572, but 29524*3 is actually 88572, right? Let me check:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 *3=60,000\n- 9,000*3=27,000\n- 500*3=1,500\n- 20*3=60\n- 4*3=12\n\nAdding them: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; +1,500=88,500; +60=88,560; +12=88,572. Yes, correct. Then step 10 is 1 + 88,572 =88,573. Then step 11 is 3*88,573=265,719.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of times I had to compute.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nEach time, it's 3(1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me check:\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n- Then each next layer adds another 1+3(...), so the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to step 11, which would imply 10 layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me see: the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I have 1+3(...), so let's count:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n10. Finally, the outermost 3(...)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...) inside, and then the outermost 3(...). So, when I computed up to step 11, I think I included the outermost 3 as step 11, but the innermost is step 1, so steps 1 through 10 would be the innermost to the one before the outermost, and step 11 is the outermost.\n\nBut let me recount:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n10. Then, the outermost 3 times that.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, and then the outermost 3. So, in my earlier steps, I went up to step 11, which included the outermost 3. So, that's correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error in any step. Let's go through each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n2. Next: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n3. Next: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n4. Next: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n5. Next: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n10. Next: 1+3*29524=1+88572=88573\n11. Outermost: 3*88573=265,719\n\nWait, but when I computed step 10, I had 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88,572 =88,573. Then step 11 is 3*88,573=265,719.\n\nBut let me check step 9 again: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n- 1*3=3\n- 4*3=12, carryover 1\n- 8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2\n- 9*3=27 +2=29\n\nSo, 9841*3=29,523. Then 1 +29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen step 10: 1 +3*29,524.\n\n3*29,524: Let's compute that.\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n- 9 (from 29,524) is actually 2*10,000, so 2*3=6, but wait, no, 29,524 is 2*10,000 +9*1,000 +5*100 +2*10 +4*1.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute as:\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n= (30,000 - 476) *3\n\n= 90,000 - 1,428\n\n= 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29,524=88,572. Then 1 +88,572=88,573.\n\nThen step 11: 3*88,573.\n\nAs before, 88,573*3=265,719.\n\nSo, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses and threes. It seems like a nested expression where each part is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built recursively, with each inner part being 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. So, maybe I can solve it starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Let's denote each part as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define E(n) as the expression starting from the nth level. So, the innermost part is E(9) = 1 + 3, then E(8) = 1 + 3*E(9), and so on until E(0) which is the entire expression we need to compute.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them: starting from the left, each \"1+3(...)\" is a level. So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next one is 1+3*(previous), and so on, until we have nine layers. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let's compute that first.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(result from Level 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext level out, it's 1 + 3*(result from Level 2).\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nContinuing this way, let's compute each level step by step.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, after computing the innermost part up to Level 9, which is 29524, do I then multiply that by 3?\n\nWait, no. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent level adds 1 + 3*(previous result). So, actually, the entire nested part is 29524, and then the outermost 3 multiplies that.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Level 9, that was the result of the innermost expression, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the total expression is 3*(29524).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me recount the levels. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Level 1)\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Level 2)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Level 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Level 4)\n5. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Level 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Level 6)\n7. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Level 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Level 8)\n9. Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Level 9)\n\nSo, the entire nested part inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total expression is 88572.\n\nBut let me cross-verify my calculations because sometimes when you do it step by step, you might make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed each level, I ended up with Level 9 being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me make sure that the Level 9 is indeed the correct value inside the outermost parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level. Let's count how many levels there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Level 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Level 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Level 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Level 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Level 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Level 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Level 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Level 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Level 9)\n\nYes, that's nine levels, so the innermost is Level 1, and the outermost parentheses before the initial 3 is Level 9. So, the entire nested expression is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I computed Level 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, so when I multiply by 3, I get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think.\n\nEach level is defined as E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), starting from E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for E(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is E(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1).\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume E_p(n) = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E(1) = 4.\n\nE(1) = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, E(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, E(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by iterative computation. So, the nested expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of levels is correct. Since the original expression has nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent level adds another 1+3*(...). So, with nine levels, n=9, which gives E(9)=29524.\n\nThus, 3*E(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula I derived.\n\nSince E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*E(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=9, so total expression = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, total expression = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nSo, all methods point to the answer being 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the solution is correct. I've checked it iteratively, using the recursive formula, and using the closed-form expression, and all give the same result. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating the nested terms from the innermost parentheses outward, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, and applying the closed-form formula for the nth term of the series. The final result is obtained by multiplying the computed nested value by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such nested terms.\n\n2. **Compute Each Level**:\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Closed-Form Formula**:\n   - Recognize the recursive relation E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1) with E(1) = 4.\n   - The solution to this recurrence is E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n   - For n=9, E(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by the Outermost 3**:\n   - The entire nested expression evaluates to 29524.\n   - Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

It seems like a series of expressions where each one is 1 plus 3 times something else, and this pattern repeats multiple times. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one step out, it's (1 + 3*(result from step 1)).\n3. And this continues until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nLet me try to write this out step by step. I'll label each step from 1 to 9, corresponding to the number of nested parentheses.\n\n**Step 1:** Compute the innermost expression.\n- Expression: 1 + 3\n- Calculation: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Result: 4\n\n**Step 2:** Next layer out.\n- Expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1)\n- Calculation: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n- Result: 13\n\n**Step 3:** Next layer.\n- Expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2)\n- Calculation: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n- Result: 40\n\n**Step 4:** Next layer.\n- Expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 3)\n- Calculation: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n- Result: 121\n\n**Step 5:** Next layer.\n- Expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 4)\n- Calculation: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n- Result: 364\n\n**Step 6:** Next layer.\n- Expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 5)\n- Calculation: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n- Result: 1093\n\n**Step 7:** Next layer.\n- Expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 6)\n- Calculation: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n- Result: 3280\n\n**Step 8:** Next layer.\n- Expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 7)\n- Calculation: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n- Result: 9841\n\n**Step 9:** The outermost layer.\n- Expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 8)\n- Calculation: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n- Result: 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original problem is 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So after computing the innermost parentheses all the way out to get 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\n**Final Step:** Multiply the result from Step 9 by 3.\n- Calculation: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n- Result: 88572\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to get lost in the layers.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 27.\n\nWait, actually, let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a linear function of the previous one. This kind of recursive relation might be expressible using a formula.\n\nLet me denote the result at each step as a_n, where n is the step number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that for such linear recursions, the solution can be found using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = C + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for step n, the result is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for step n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: starting from the innermost, which is step 1, and going out to step 9, so n=9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end. So, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is step 1: a_1 =4\n\nThen, step 2: a_2=13\n\n...\n\nStep 9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, compute 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, the formula approach confirms that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in either the step-by-step computation or the formula approach.

    "text": " Compute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to parse this from the inside out because each innermost expression is probably dependent on the next one. So, I think I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way outward. \n\nLet me write this out step by step to keep track. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another (1 + 3(...)), but now the inner part is 4. So, let's compute that next level.\n\nSo, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute the multiplication first before the addition because of the order of operations. \n\n3 * 4 = 12.\n\nNow, adding 1 to that: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that middle part simplifies to 13. Now, moving one level out again, the next expression is 1 + 3(13). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3 * 13. Let me see, 13 * 3 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives me 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, that part simplifies to 40. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3(40). Let's compute that.\n\n3 * 40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, that simplifies to 121. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(121). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 121. Hmm, 120 * 3 is 360, so 121 * 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nAlright, so that part becomes 364. Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3(364). Let's calculate that.\n\n3 * 364. Let's break this down: 300 * 3 = 900, 60 * 3 = 180, 4 * 3 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo, that's 1093. Next layer out, we have 1 + 3(1093). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 1093. Let's see, 1000 * 3 = 3000, 90 * 3 = 270, 3 * 3 = 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nSo, that part becomes 3280. Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3(3280). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 3280. Hmm, 3000 * 3 = 9000, 200 * 3 = 600, 80 * 3 = 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nAlright, so that simplifies to 9841. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(9841). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 9841. Let's break this down: 9000 * 3 = 27000, 800 * 3 = 2400, 40 * 3 = 120, 1 * 3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, that becomes 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524. Let's see, 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nSo, that simplifies to 88573. Now, finally, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, let's compute that.\n\n3 * 88573. Hmm, let's break this down: 80000 * 3 = 240000, 8000 * 3 = 24000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 70 * 3 = 210, 3 * 3 = 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719.\n\nSo, 3 multiplied by 88573 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify 3*88573 another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 88573 * 3:\n\n88573\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, carryover 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26.\n\nSo, writing it down: 265719. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 88573 * 3: Let's compute 80000 * 3 = 240000, 8000 * 3 = 24000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 70 * 3 = 210, 3 * 3 = 9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, +1500 = 265500, +210 = 265710, +9 = 265719. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. So, the final result is 265719.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe I should check one more step. Let's see, when I had 1 + 3*29524, I got 88573. Let me confirm that 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Correct.\n\nOkay, so all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 265719.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing the entire expression using a different approach, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure of the expression, it seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). Let's see if this forms a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_i, where i is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nAnd then the final result is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n where n is the number of layers. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's compute a few terms to find another equation.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A = 3/2 into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the closed-form works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 4, and we have 9 layers in total because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses: 3( [1 + 3( [1 + 3( [1 + 3( [1 + 3( [1 + 3( [1 + 3( [1 + 3( [1 + 3( [1 + 3))))))))) ] So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, so that's 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is a_9, but wait, in our earlier calculation, a_1 was the innermost, so a_9 would be the 9th layer from the inside. But in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). So, let me see.\n\nWait, actually, in our previous calculation, a_1 was the innermost, and we had a_2, a_3, up to a_9, which was the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, a_9 = 88573, as calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, that's not matching our earlier a_9 which was 29524. Wait, but in our previous step-by-step, a_9 was 29524, and then a_10 was 88573.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the expression, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1: a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so the next layer is a_2 = 13, then a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 88573.\n\nWait, but according to the closed-form, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in our step-by-step, a_9 was 29524, and then a_10 was 88573, which would correspond to n=10.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1: a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, each layer outward is another (1 + 3*a_{previous}).\n\nSo, in the original expression, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, so the outermost before the final multiplication is a_9.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, when I had 9 layers, a_9 was 29524, and then the next layer, a_10, was 88573, which would be the 10th layer. But in the original problem, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count again: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 times.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, meaning that the outermost layer is a_9, which according to the formula is 29524. But in my earlier step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which might be the confusion.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step earlier. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each (1 + 3(...)) is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each (1 + 3(...) corresponds to a layer.\n\nSo, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I had 10 layers leading to 88573, but that must be incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering one extra layer. So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_10 = 88573, which would be incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier when I thought there were 10 layers. Let me recount the number of opening parentheses.\n\nThe original expression after the first 3 is:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the step-by-step, I ended up with 265719, which would be 3*a_10, but that's incorrect because there are only 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3*(layer1), where layer1 is 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on, until layer9 is 1 + 3*(layer10), but no, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this layer1.\n\n- Then, moving out, we have (1 + 3*layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. That's layer2.\n\n- Next layer out: (1 + 3*layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer3.\n\n- Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121. Layer4.\n\n- Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364. Layer5.\n\n- Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093. Layer6.\n\n- Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280. Layer7.\n\n- Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841. Layer8.\n\n- Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524. Layer9.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier conclusion where I thought the final result was 265719. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I miscounted the number of layers. I thought there were 10 layers, but actually, there are only 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). Therefore, the correct final result should be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_10 = 88573, which led to 3*88573 = 265719. That must be incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the layers again.\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which led to 265719, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers because I included the initial 3 as a layer, but it's not. The initial 3 is just a multiplier, not part of the layers. So, the layers are only the 9 (1 + 3*(...)) parts.\n\nTherefore, the correct final result should be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but then why did I get 265719 earlier? Because I thought there were 10 layers, including the initial 3, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is 3*(layer1), where layer1 is 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on, until layer9 is 1 + 3*(layer10). Wait, no, that can't be because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from layer1 = 1 + 3, then layer2 = 1 + 3*layer1, etc., up to layer9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as having n layers, starting from layer1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then the outermost layer is layer9, and the entire expression is 3*layer9.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, layer9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the step-by-step, I thought there were 10 layers, which led me to 265719, but that must be incorrect. So, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because I thought the step-by-step gave me 265719, but perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the layers carefully.\n\nLet me write down each layer:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 10 layers, I got 265719, which is incorrect. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut now I'm confused because in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 265719, which must be wrong because I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me count the number of times the expression (1 + 3*(...)) appears.\n\nIn the original expression, starting after the initial 3, each (1 + 3*(...)) is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost layer is layer9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but now I'm really confused because in my initial step-by-step, I thought I had 10 layers leading to 265719, but that must be wrong. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula to confirm.\n\nUsing the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by considering one extra layer, leading to the wrong answer of 265719. The correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost layer is layer9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 10 layers, which led me to 265719, which must be incorrect. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think the confusion arose because I miscounted the layers initially, thinking there were 10 layers instead of 9. Now, after carefully recounting, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this using the formula again.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by considering one extra layer, leading to the wrong answer. So, the correct final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 265719, which is 3*88573, but that's because I had 10 layers, which is incorrect. The correct number of layers is 9, leading to 88572.\n\nTherefore, I must correct my earlier conclusion and state that the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more by computing the entire expression step by step with 9 layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 8857"

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, okay. So it's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. It seems like each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So the next step is 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n3*4 = 12.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. Each level is 1 + 3*(previous result). So maybe I should label each step to keep track.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)\n\nAnd so on, until Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of parentheses to see how many levels there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a level, so starting from the innermost, each level adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). So let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n... and so on, until we have 9 levels.\n\nWait, actually, let me check. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost 1 + 3. So how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), etc.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Let's see:\n\nEach time, we have a 1 + 3*(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of 1+3 expressions. Let me count:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is enclosed in a pair of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each with a 1 + 3*(...). So the innermost is layer 9, then layer 8, etc., up to layer 1.\n\nSo, to compute this, I need to start from layer 9 and work my way up to layer 1.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\n...\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nWait, no, actually, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 1), so perhaps it's better to number them from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9.\n\nWait, maybe I should number them starting from the innermost as layer 1, moving outward to layer 9.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, no, let me make sure. Let me parse the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), where the ... is the next layer. So starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nBut when I counted the layers earlier, I considered that the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, but in reality, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So the total expression is 3*(layer 9), where layer 9 is 1 + 3*(layer 8), and so on.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLet me define each level starting from the innermost as level 1, then moving outward as level 2, up to level 9.\n\nSo:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*29524\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nYes, because the original expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + C\n\nWhere A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Assume a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = C.\n\nThen, C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C =1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000 \u2192 total so far: 60000 +27000=87000\n\n500*3=1500 \u2192 total: 87000 +1500=88500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 total:88500 +60=88560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 total:88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure out how to approach this. It seems like each part is similar, so maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Let's compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that part becomes 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Wait, no, actually, looking back, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, let me count how many times this nesting happens. Let's see: starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), and this repeats multiple times. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after each 3: there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times 1+3 appears nested.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse it more carefully. Let me write it as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me compute each level one by one.\n\nLet me define each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression computed up to Level 9.\n\nWait, let me confirm: the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9. So, 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct?

Let me recount the levels.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4\n\nLevel 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLevel 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLevel 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLevel 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLevel 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLevel 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLevel 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLevel 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Level 9 again. 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can compute this in a different way, perhaps using a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or a recursive formula.\n\nLet me see. Let's denote each level as L_n, where n is the level number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Suppose L_n = C for all n. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2.\n\nHmm, but that's a fraction, and our initial terms are integers, so maybe this approach is not directly helpful, but perhaps it can still be used.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution is L_n^p = -1/2, as above.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 =4.\n\nSo, L_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A =4 +1/2= 9/2\n\nSo, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1:\n\nL_1= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\n(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Level 9, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked using both iterative computation and a formula, so I'm confident in the result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed as 1 + 3*(previous level). After computing up to the ninth level, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next level: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process up to the ninth level, resulting in 29524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to visualize it. It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something), and that something is another similar expression. So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to make it clearer:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each set is of the form 3(1 + ... ). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(innermost result)\n3. Then another: 1 + 3(result of previous)\n4. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to count how many times 3 is multiplied. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each step adds another 3 multiplier. So, the innermost is just 1 + 3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each layer adds another exponent or something. Hmm, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, E3, up to E9, where E9 is the entire expression we need to compute.\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nWait, but no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(E9). So, maybe I need to adjust that.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*next layer, except the innermost one is just 1 + 3.\n\nSo, perhaps E1 is 1 + 3.\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on until E9, and then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me try to compute each E step by step.\n\nLet me start:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from E1 as the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, but I think I might have made a mistake because when I count the number of layers, there are nine layers, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with nine 3s. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses:\n\nEach opening parenthesis has a 3 after the first. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, the first 3 is outside the entire expression, then inside, each time after the 1, there's a 3. So, how many times does 3 appear after the 1s?\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 appears after a 1:\n\nLooking at the problem, it's written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is the innermost, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ... )\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nAfter the initial 3, there are nine opening parentheses: each 1+3(...\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as having eight layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses:\n\nEach time after a 1, there's a 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nThen the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is used after a 1:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 8 more 3s, so total 9 layers?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the initial 3 is outside, and then each layer inside adds another 3. Let me try to see the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each layer as E1, E2, up to E9, where each Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1), starting from E1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, so E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in the problem, the initial 3 is outside, so perhaps that's correct. So, the total would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The problem is written as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then the next is (1 + 3*(innermost))\n- Then (1 + 3*(previous))\n- And so on.\n\nHow many such layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nAfter the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses, each followed by a 1 + 3(...). So, that would make 8 layers, meaning E1 to E8, with E8 being the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it reversed earlier. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf the innermost is E1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\n...\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nWait, but in that case, the entire expression would be 3*E9.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the numbering. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nLet me represent the expression as a series of nested functions. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say the innermost expression is A1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen A2 = 1 + 3*A1\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*A2\n\nContinuing until A8 = 1 + 3*A7\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*A8\n\nWait, so that would mean 8 layers inside, and the initial 3 is outside. So, perhaps I only have 8 layers to compute, not 9.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nCompute A1 to A8:\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*A8 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, that's different from my previous result. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem is written as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the 1s. Starting from the innermost, each time there's a 3. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many 3s are there after the 1s?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that would mean 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in that case, when I computed up to E9 = 29524, then 3*E9 = 88572. But when I thought of it as 8 layers inside, I got 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nI think the confusion is whether the initial 3 is part of the layers or not. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), and the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, how many layers of 3*(1 + ...) are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\nEach time after a 1, there's a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nAfter the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses: each 1+3(...\n\nSo, that would mean 8 layers inside, each adding another 3*(...). Then, the entire expression is 3*(result of 8 layers). So, perhaps my second approach was correct, leading to 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check again step by step.\n\nCompute each layer:\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*A8 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I had E9 as 29524, leading to 3*29524 = 88572, but perhaps that was an error in the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let me write it with indices to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that would mean 9 layers inside, each adding another 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in that case, when I computed up to E9 = 29524, then 3*E9 = 88572.\n\nBut when I thought of it as 8 layers inside, I got 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nI think the confusion is in how I'm counting the layers. Let me try to index the layers properly.\n\nLet me define each layer starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, with that, Layer 1 = 4\n\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I counted the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I saw 8, which would imply 8 layers. But according to this, it's 9 layers inside, leading to 88572.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the initial 3 is part of the layers or not. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time there's a 3 after the 1, and each of these is inside another set of parentheses. So, how many 3s are there after the 1s?\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n4. 1 + 3*(...)\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n6. 1 + 3*(...)\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n8. 1 + 3*(...)\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n\nWait, that would make 9 instances of 1 + 3*(...), so 9 layers inside, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that would mean 9 layers inside, leading to 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought there were 8 layers, I got 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nI think the correct approach is to count the number of times 3 appears after the 1s. Let me count them:\n\nIn the problem, after each 1, there's a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count how many times this happens:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after each 1, there's a 3(...\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...\n3. 1 + 3(...\n4. 1 + 3(...\n5. 1 + 3(...\n6. 1 + 3(...\n7. 1 + 3(...\n8. 1 + 3(...\n9. 1 + 3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 times where after a 1, there's a 3(...\n\nSo, that would mean 9 layers inside, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, with that, Layer9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer8 = 9841, then Layer9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me confirm each step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nEntire expression: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Since each layer is of the form E = 1 + 3*E_prev, and we have n layers, perhaps it's a geometric series.\n\nLet me think: Each layer can be represented as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution for such a recurrence is E_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nThe general solution for E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b is E_n = a^n * E_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) if a \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = 1.\n\nSo, E_n = 3^n * E_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * E_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nBut E_0 would be the initial term. In our case, when n=1, E1 = 1 + 3*E0. If we take E0 = 0, then E1 = 1 + 0 = 1, but that's not our case.\n\nWait, in our case, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, perhaps E0 = 1.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nWait, so when n=1, E1 = 4\n\nn=2, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nn=3, E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe general solution for E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1} can be found by solving the recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming E_n^{(p)} = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers inside, so E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( E_2 = 1 + 3E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( E_3 = 1 + 3E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( E_4 = 1 + 3E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( E_5 = 1 + 3E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( E_6 = 1 + 3E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( E_7 = 1 + 3E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( E_8 = 1 + 3E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( E_9 = 1 + 3E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each layer is a 1 plus 3 times something, and each time it's multiplied by 3 again. So it's like a chain of operations. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with parentheses.\n\nLet me write it out more clearly, maybe starting from the innermost parenthesis and expanding each step. So the innermost part is (1+3), right? Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, that becomes 1 + 3*(result from innermost). So the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but okay, let's go on. Next layer is 1 + 3*40.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, this is getting bigger each time. Let me note down each step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has a lot of parentheses, so maybe I should count how many times I'm doing this operation. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time I'm moving out one layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the original problem: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses, but the innermost is (1+3), which is 10 layers deep? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me see: each time I have a 1+3(...), so how many times does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe I should parse it more carefully. Let me try to count how many times \"1+3(...)\" occurs, which would correspond to the number of layers. So starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1. Then each time I go out, it's another layer. So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end. Wait, no, maybe it's easier to just expand each layer step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(88573) = ?\n\nWait, so that's 11 layers? Because I started counting from 1 to 11. But when I did this earlier, I stopped at 10 layers and got 29524, then the next step would be 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then the outermost 3 times that. Hmm, maybe I miscounted before.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem has 9 layers. Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n- The first 1+3 is inside the 9th set of parentheses. So perhaps there are 9 layers. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, right? So after 9 layers, I get 29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3*(29524). So 3*29524 is equal to... let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that after 9 layers, I had 29524, and then I multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But in my first attempt, I went up to 10 layers, which might have been incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses, but the innermost is (1+3), so perhaps there are 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\" inside each other, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the innermost is the 9th layer, and then the 10th layer is the outermost 3*(...). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, so when I compute up to 9 layers, I get 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. 4\n2. 13\n3. 40\n4. 121\n5. 364\n6. 1093\n7. 3280\n8. 9841\n9. 29524\n\nSo that's 9 layers, and then the final step is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial attempt, I thought maybe there was an 11th layer, but perhaps I was miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps I should check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me verify each step carefully:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So after 9 layers, I get 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial thought process, I thought maybe I had 10 layers, but perhaps I was mistaken. So the correct answer would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations, just to be sure.\n\nLet me compute each step again:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute this again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Assume a constant solution a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the original expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), then using the formula for a geometric series might help.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is 1 + 3*previous term, it's more of a linear recurrence, which we've already solved.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it another way. Let me compute the entire expression step by step again, but this time writing each layer with its own parentheses to avoid confusion.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times and through different methods, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.
