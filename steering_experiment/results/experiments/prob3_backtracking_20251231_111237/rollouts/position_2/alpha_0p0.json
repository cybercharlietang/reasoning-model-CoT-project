    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to parse this. It seems like each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something, and then that whole thing is multiplied by 3. So it's like a chain of operations. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let's count how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), and that repeats multiple times. Let me see, from the inside out:\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on. Let me try to compute each layer one by one.\n\nSo, let's define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So there are nine layers. So I need to compute from the innermost one, which is Level 9, up to Level 1.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is the last one: (1+3). Then, moving outwards, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So maybe I should compute from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, S2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2\n\nAnd so on, up to S9, and then the entire expression is 3*S9.\n\nWait, but let me check: the entire expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost parentheses up to S9, I have to multiply that result by 3.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3*(something). That something is 1 + 3*(something else), and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to compute the innermost first and work outward. Let me try that.\n\nLet me list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(29524). So I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 So 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that again, because 29524 is 29,524. So 3*29,524.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step again because I might have made a mistake in the earlier computations.\n\nWait, let me go back to each S1 to S9 to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\nCompute 3*9000=27,000\n\n3*800=2,400\n\n3*40=120\n\n3*1=3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nThen S9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29,524\n\nAs I did before, 29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, reading from top, it's 88,572\n\nWait, but let me verify that 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, 30,000 *3=90,000, so 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000.\n\nSo 90,000 - (476*3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. Sometimes when I compute step by step, I might have missed a carry or miscalculated a multiplication.\n\nLet me recheck S1 to S9:\n\nS1: 1+3=4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nS2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nS3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nS4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nS5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nS6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nS7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nS8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nS9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations when I went through each step carefully. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer helps prevent errors.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula, but given the depth of the nesting, it's probably easier to compute step by step. Alternatively, maybe there's a geometric series involved, but I don't see an immediate way to apply that here without more analysis.\n\nWait, actually, let me think about it another way. Each step is of the form S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, starting from S1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for S_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S1=4.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: S_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume S_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApply initial condition S1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula for n=1: S1 should be 4.\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: S2=13.\n\n(3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: S3=40.\n\n(3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=4: S4=121.\n\n(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, S9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo S9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*S9=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nSo whether I compute step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I'm confident enough now that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

I think the key here is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me try to parse this expression.\n\nFirst, I notice that the entire expression is a series of 3's multiplied by terms that involve 1 plus another 3 times something. It's like a chain of 3's and 1's. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next layer: 1+3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1+3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers here because each time we add another set of parentheses, and I can count nine sets of (1+3(...)). Let me confirm that by counting the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then it's (1+3(...)), so that's two layers\n3. Continuing, up to nine layers. Let me see: Each time we add another 3(...), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). So yes, I think there are nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 3 is being multiplied after each 1+. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1+3)\n3. 3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n5. Continuing this way until the ninth layer.\n\nSo, there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write this out step by step:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = ?\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = ?\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = ?\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so after computing L9, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Hmm, maybe I should adjust my notation.\n\nWait, let me look again. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built by the previous one.\n\nLet me define a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a2 = 1 + 3*a1\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2\n\nAnd so on, up to a9.\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers. Let me check:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3*(1+3*(...)) sections, I think it's nine. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3: \n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time we have a 3*(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\n1. The first is 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then inside that, 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nI think there are nine 3*(1 + ...) terms. So, that would mean we have nine layers, each time adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps another 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, let's define a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a2 = 1 + 3*a1\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2\n\n...\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so yes, that would be 3*a9.\n\nSo, let's compute each a_i step by step.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made an error in the multiplication or in the a_i steps.\n\nLet me go through each a_i again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\na1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*a9 = 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3 again:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n________\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, let me write it out properly.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n________\n\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the number seems large. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied instead of computing each step manually, which might be error-prone.\n\nLooking at the sequence a1, a2, ..., a9, each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\na1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, a9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, a9 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, actually, let me see:\n\nIf I expand a9:\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8\n\nBut a8 = 1 + 3*a7\n\nSo, a9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a7) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a7\n\nContinuing this way, each step adds another power of 3.\n\nTherefore, after expanding all the way, a9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf a1 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*(3^0 + 3^1) = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}\n\nWait, but wait, a1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1\n\na2 is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\na3 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, yes, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, starting from k=0, 3^0=1, but in our case, a1 starts with 1 + 3, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nWait, so a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but in our case, a1 corresponds to n=1: sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSimilarly, a2 = sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nBut wait, when we have a9, that would be sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nSo, yes, this confirms that the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, which would have saved time and reduced the chance of error.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S_n = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, r=3, and n=9 (since we're summing from 3^0 to 3^9).\n\nSo, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29,524*3=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition.

It seems like there are multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me write that down:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 3 times that result. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe next layer is 3*(1 + 3). But wait, since the innermost is 1 + 3, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(innermost result). Wait, maybe I misread it. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the problem again, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we go out nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3(1+3(...) parts. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(previous)\n3. 1 + 3*(previous)\n...\nIt seems like there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(something). So, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me number each layer from 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + something). Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So let's count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen moving out:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(result of layer 9). So after computing layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3:\n\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me double-check each multiplication to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 =15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3=88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} + c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1.\n\nSo, the closed-form would be:\n\na_n = (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/(1 - 3) = -1/2\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nWe know that a_1 = 4, so:\n\na_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9*3^{n-1})/2 = 3^{n+1}/2, since 9=3^2, so 3^2 *3^{n-1}=3^{n+1}\n\nWait, 3^{n+1}/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nSo, the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so using the formula, I can compute a_n directly without computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nSo, in this problem, n=9 layers, so a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n500*3=1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n24*3=72 \u2192 Total: 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nTotal expression = 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nWait, because 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo that's another way to compute it, using exponents.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a linear pattern, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Using the closed-form formula for the nth term of the sequence, \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), for \\(n = 9\\), we get \\(a_9 = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let's see. It's a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to be of the form 1 + 3 times something. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me write that down.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, it becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nAlright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nHmm, so that's 40. Let's go another layer out. Again, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is now 40. So, 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Okay, so that's 121.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that.\n\n3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nSo, that layer is 364. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\nLet me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nSo, that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nSo, that's 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCalculating 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nAlright, that's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nSo, that's 29524. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nAlright, so that's 88573. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute 3*88573. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720.\n\nSo, that's 265720. Now, the entire expression inside the parentheses simplifies to 265720. But wait, the original problem is 3 times that, right?\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(265720). Let me compute that.\n\n3*265720. Let's break it down: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because that's a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses and moving outwards, each step was:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nThen, 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nWait, let me verify each step again because it's easy to make an arithmetic error here.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093: 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280: 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841: 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. 1 + 3*29524: 3*29524 is 88572, so 1 + 88572 = 88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n11. 1 + 3*88573: 3*88573 is 265719, so 1 + 265719 = 265720 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*265720.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n265720 * 3:\n\n200000*3 = 600000\n\n60000*3 = 180000\n\n5000*3 = 15000\n\n700*3 = 2100\n\n20*3 = 60\n\nAdding them:\n\n600000 + 180000 = 780000\n\n780000 + 15000 = 795000\n\n795000 + 2100 = 797100\n\n797100 + 60 = 797160\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly because the expression has multiple layers, and I might have miscounted.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

Finally, the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of 1+3(...) inside each other, and then the outermost 3 times that.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I only had 11 steps, but maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1+3*(result)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. (1+3*(result)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. (1+3*40) = 121\n5. (1+3*121) = 364\n6. (1+3*364) = 1093\n7. (1+3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1+3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1+3*9841) = 29524\n10. (1+3*29524) = 88573\n11. (1+3*88573) = 265720\n12. 3*265720 = 797160\n\nWait, so actually, there are 11 layers, but the outermost is the multiplication by 3, so maybe 10 layers inside?\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...).

Then the outermost 3*(...)\n\nSo, actually, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...) and then the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, so when I was computing earlier, I had 11 steps, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1+3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1+3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1+3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1+3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1+3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1+3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1+3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1+3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1+3*29524 = 88573\n11. Next: 1+3*88573 = 265720\n12. Finally, 3*265720 = 797160\n\nWait, so that's 11 layers of computation, but the original expression only has 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(\n2. Then another (1+3(\n3. And so on.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n10. Then the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to 265720, that was 9 layers, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 797160.\n\nBut earlier, when I was stepping through, I had 12 steps, but maybe I miscounted. Let me try to recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1+3*4) = 13\n3. (1+3*13) = 40\n4. (1+3*40) = 121\n5. (1+3*121) = 364\n6. (1+3*364) = 1093\n7. (1+3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1+3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1+3*9841) = 29524\n10. (1+3*29524) = 88573\n11. (1+3*88573) = 265720\n12. 3*265720 = 797160\n\nWait, so that's 12 steps, but the original expression only has 9 layers inside. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that each layer adds another 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, each step adds a layer. So, if there are 9 layers inside, we need to compute 9 times.\n\nWait, let me try to structure it differently.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each nested expression as a function f(n), where n is the number of layers.\n\nSo, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nf(10) = 1 + 3*f(9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nf(11) = 1 + 3*f(10) = 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(11) = 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nBut wait, the original expression has 9 layers inside, so f(9) would be the innermost, but according to my earlier count, f(9) is 29524, but in the original expression, the innermost is only 1+3, which is f(1)=4.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the original expression has 9 layers, so f(9) would be the outermost inside the 3. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3( inside:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1+3( adds another layer.\n\nSo, let me count the number of (1+3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n10. Then the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, f(9) would be the innermost, which is 4, but that can't be because f(1)=4.\n\nWait, no, perhaps f(n) is defined as the expression with n layers. So, f(1)=1+3=4.\n\nf(2)=1+3*(1+3)=13\n\nf(3)=1+3*f(2)=40\n\nf(4)=1+3*f(3)=121\n\nf(5)=1+3*f(4)=364\n\nf(6)=1+3*f(5)=1093\n\nf(7)=1+3*f(6)=3280\n\nf(8)=1+3*f(7)=9841\n\nf(9)=1+3*f(8)=29524\n\nThen, the original expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier computation where I had 265720 as the innermost before the outermost 3.\n\nI think I'm getting confused because the way I defined f(n) earlier was different. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the original expression is 3*(f(9)), where f(1)=4, f(2)=13, f(3)=40, f(4)=121, f(5)=364, f(6)=1093, f(7)=3280, f(8)=9841, f(9)=29524.\n\nThen, 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step, I ended up with 797160, which suggests that I had 11 layers instead of 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression has 9 layers, so f(9)=29524, and the outermost 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut when I computed step by step earlier, I had 11 layers, which might be incorrect.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of 1+3( in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1+3( adds a layer.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, Layer1=4\n\nLayer2=1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3=1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4=1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5=1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6=1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7=1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8=1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that would mean my initial step-by-step computation was incorrect because I continued beyond Layer9, which isn't present in the original expression.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by continuing beyond the 9 layers, which isn't part of the problem. So, actually, the correct computation should stop at Layer9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original expression again.\n\nIt's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3( inside:\n\nFrom the first 3, each (1+3( adds a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9.

So, I need to correct that.\n\nSo, the correct computation is up to Layer9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write out each step with the correct number of layers.\n\nLet me try again, carefully counting each layer.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier by continuing beyond the 9th layer, which wasn't part of the original problem. So, the confusion arose from miscounting the layers. Now, after carefully recounting, I see that there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3, leading to the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one step at a time without getting confused.\n\nAlright, so the innermost part is the last set of parentheses: (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I get the structure right. The expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ( ... )). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next parentheses).\n\nLet me write this out step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nSo, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so the next level simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is:\n\n3. 1 + 3*(result from step 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*13 = 39\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo now, that level is 40. Next level out:\n\n4. 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCalculating:\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nAlright, moving on:\n\n5. 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*121 = 363\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext level:\n\n6. 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCalculating:\n\n3*364 = 1092\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nContinuing:\n\n7. 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute:\n\n3*1093 = 3279\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext step:\n\n8. 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating:\n\n3*3280 = 9840\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nMoving out another level:\n\n9. 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute:\n\n3*9841 = 29523\n\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost expression:\n\n10. 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step builds on the previous one, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards. Each time, we compute the innermost expression, substitute it into the next level, and so on, until we reach the outermost expression. \n\nLet me recap the steps quickly to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8.

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out. I think the key here is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions like this.\n\nSo, the expression is a series of 3s multiplied by something inside parentheses. Each time, it's 3 times (1 + something). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1+3).\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3(1+3)).\n3. Next layer would be (1 + 3(1 + 3(1+3))).\n4. I can see this pattern continues until the outermost layer.\n\nLet me try to write this out step by step. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving out one layer:\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, hold on. Actually, the structure is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So let me clarify:\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + next inner expression). So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + (1+3)), then the next is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3))), and so on.\n\nSo perhaps I should define each layer step by step. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are 9 layers of 3s.\n\nWait, let me check: the original expression has 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and inside each, another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s multiplied by the parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3)\nNext: 3*(1 + (1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\nNext: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4 (since the innermost is 1+3=4). Then, each subsequent term is built using the previous one.\n\nSo, starting with a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so the outermost layer is a_9, which is 36084. But let me confirm how many layers there are. The original expression has 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and each time inside, another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + (1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So the final result is 36084. But wait, let me check this again, because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let's see, each term is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). So, expanding this, a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), let's try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3 + 3*K => K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2 => 3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify that: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 11*6561: Let's compute 10*6561 = 65610, plus 1*6561 = 6561, so total is 65610 + 6561 = 72171.\n\nThen, 72171 - 3 = 72168.\n\nDivide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084.\n\nSo that matches the step-by-step computation earlier. Therefore, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me verify with another approach. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step again, but this time, write down each value.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern in the numbers. Let's list the a_n values:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 15\n\na3 = 48\n\na4 = 147\n\na5 = 444\n\na6 = 1335\n\na7 = 4008\n\na8 = 12027\n\na9 = 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous plus 3. Wait, actually, from a1 to a2: 4*3 + 3 = 15, yes. From a2 to a3: 15*3 + 3 = 48, yes. So the pattern is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nWait, but in our initial approach, we had a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is the same as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, using this recurrence, we can compute each term. As we did, and the final term is a9 = 36084.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n5.

It seems like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost part, I think I should work my way outwards. That usually works with these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step to visualize it better. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outwards, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, let's start from the inside and move out.\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3\n   That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n   So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n   So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n   So, 1 + 3*40. Hmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n   That's 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n   So, 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is... let me do 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n   That's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n   So, 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n   That's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9)\n    So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n10. 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, let me verify 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression has multiple layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the original problem: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with (1+3(...)). So, that means there are nine layers, right? Let me check my steps again to ensure I didn't miss a layer.\n\n1. 1+3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1+3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1+3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1+3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1+3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1+3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1+3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1+3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1+3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 (Final result)\n\nYes, that's nine layers inside the initial 3(...). So, 10 steps in total, with the last step being the multiplication by 3. So, the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way, even though it's a bit tedious.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed as a formula instead of computing each step. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that can represent this.\n\nLooking at each layer:\n\nAfter layer 1: 4 = 1 + 3\nAfter layer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\nAfter layer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\nAfter layer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*40\n...\n\nSo, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only nine terms, computing each step is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, solving the recurrence relation:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, the 9th layer gives us 29524, and then the final step is multiplying by 3, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost part and working our way outwards. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost expression and proceed outward. Here are the key steps:\n\n1. Innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n10.

Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on...\n\nWait, actually, looking at it, each time it's 1 + 3 times another similar expression. Let me count the number of times this happens. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. Let me check again. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3(...) and each (...) is another layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the original problem, I see that the innermost part is 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, perhaps another approach: each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of 3s is one more than the number of layers. Hmm, maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me define a term S_n, where n is the number of layers. So, S_1 = 1 + 3. Then S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1. S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2, and so on until S_9, since I think there are 9 layers here.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again. The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9 because I can see 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...)))\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS_4 = 1 + 3*S_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS_5 = 1 + 3*S_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS_6 = 1 + 3*S_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS_7 = 1 + 3*S_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS_8 = 1 + 3*S_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS_9 = 1 + 3*S_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(S_9). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing S_9, which is the innermost part, the entire expression is 3*S_9.\n\nWait, no, let me make sure. The innermost is S_1 = 1 + 3, then S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1, up to S_9, and then the entire expression is 3*S_9.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is S_1 = 4.\n\nThen S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to S_9.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*S_9.\n\nWait, but when I computed S_9, I got 29524. So then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me list out S_1 to S_9:\n\nS_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So then the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I have 9 layers. Because sometimes when you count layers, you might miscount.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, each time adding another 1 + 3(...). So yes, S_9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for S_n. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here.\n\nEach S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence:\n\nS_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nAssume S_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen S_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + (1 + 3B)\n\nEquate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, S_1 = 4.\n\nSo, S_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nThus, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nS_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nS_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, S_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, S_9 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The formula gives S_n as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors when computing 3*29524.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24\n\nSo,\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more if I have the correct number of layers. Sometimes when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3(...), so each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is one layer.\n- Then 1 + 3(1 + 3) is two layers.\n- Then 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) is three layers.\n- Continuing this way, the outermost expression is 3 times (something), which is the 9th layer.\n\nSo yes, 9 layers, so S_9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively doing 1 + 3*(previous total). So, starting from 4, each step multiplies by 3 and adds 1. So, S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, which is exactly the recurrence we used.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as \\( S_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the number of layers. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times S_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( S_3 = 1 + 3 \\times S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( S_4 = 1 + 3 \\times S_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( S_5 = 1 + 3 \\times S_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( S_6 = 1 + 3 \\times S_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( S_7 = 1 + 3 \\times S_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( S_8 = 1 + 3 \\times S_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( S_9 = 1 + 3 \\times S_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times S_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each layer is a multiplication by 3 and then adding 1, but nested multiple times. Maybe I can solve it starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nWait, no, actually, each time I replace an innermost part, I need to adjust accordingly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times the pattern repeats. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each step is (1 + 3*(...)), and it's repeated 9 times because I see 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me count the number of times the pattern is repeated. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then moving outwards, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a recursive expression where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me try to see.\n\nWait, perhaps if I denote each layer as a term, starting from the innermost, I can compute each term step by step.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built from the inside out.\n\nLet me start with the innermost expression:\n\nLet me define a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outwards, the next layer would be a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(a9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a9.\n\nSo then, the total would be 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with a1:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check each step in case I made an arithmetic error.\n\na1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem another way to confirm the answer. Perhaps using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I think of it as a recurrence relation, where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, starting from 4.\n\nWait, but in our earlier approach, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4.\n\nSo, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a0 is the initial term.\n\nIn this case, r=3, c=1, and a0=4.\n\nSo, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * 4 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1).\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = 4*3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nCombine terms:\n\na_n = (8*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nWait, 4*3^n = (8*3^n)/2, so adding (3^n -1)/2 gives (8*3^n + 3^n -1)/2 = (9*3^n -1)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have a1=4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nSo, for n=1: a1 = (9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, but wait, earlier I had a1=4. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps my indexing is off.\n\nWait, in the problem, the innermost term is (1 + 3) which is a1=4. Then a2=1 + 3*a1=13, etc., up to a9=29524.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2, but when n=1, a1 should be 4, but according to the formula, a1=(9*3^1 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which is a2 in our earlier computation. So, perhaps the formula is shifted by one.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is for a_n where n starts at 0.\n\nWait, let me try again. Let's define a0 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is our innermost term.\n\nThen a1 = 1 + 3*a0 = 1 + 3*4=13\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1=1 + 3*13=40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in that case, the general solution would be a_n = (9*3^{n} -1)/2, where n starts at 0.\n\nSo, for n=0: a0=(9*3^0 -1)/2=(9*1 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=1: a1=(9*3^1 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(9*9 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(9*27 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(9*81 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(9*243 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=6: a6=(9*729 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=7: a7=(9*2187 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=8: a8=(9*6561 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, a8 is 29524, which is our a9 in the earlier counting. Wait, no, in the problem, the innermost is a1=4, then a2=13, up to a9=29524. So, in the formula, a8=29524, which is our a9.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is a_{n} = (9*3^{n} -1)/2, where n is the number of times we've applied the operation starting from a0=4.\n\nSo, if we have 9 layers, then n=8 because starting from a0=4, each layer increments n by 1. So, the outermost layer would be 3*a8, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that matches our initial step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3*(previous layer +1). So, it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to expand the entire expression step by step, although that might take longer.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression from the inside out, writing each step:\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\n1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost layer:\n\n3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, if I expand the expression, it's like:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nWait, but perhaps I can represent this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me consider each layer as contributing a term multiplied by 3^k, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nAt the innermost layer, we have 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nWait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nBut 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) would be 1 + 3*(1 + 9) = 1 + 3*10 = 1 + 30 = 31, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, considering that each layer adds a 1 and then multiplies by 3, maybe the total can be expressed as a sum of 3^k from k=0 to n, where n is the number of layers.\n\nWait, but in our case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which seems to be a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me try to express the innermost term first.\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as S, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's (1 + 3*S) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*(1 + 3*S)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, but perhaps if I expand all the layers, I can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me try expanding it:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2\n\nWait, 1 + 3*1 + 9 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Yes.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Yes, that works.\n\nWait, so each layer adds another term in the geometric series.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value would be the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our problem, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer, and each time we go out, we have another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, because after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had a1 to a9, which corresponded to 9 layers, resulting in a9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but when I thought of the sum, I saw that each layer adds a term 3^k, so the sum would be S = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that formula: sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for example, if n=0, sum is 1; n=1, sum is 1 + 3 = 4; n=2, sum is 1 + 3 + 9 =13; n=3, sum is 1 + 3 + 9 +27=40, etc., which matches our earlier results.\n\nSo, in our problem, how many terms are we summing?\n\nWait, each layer adds another term. So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4, which is sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another term. So, if we have 9 layers, that would correspond to sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is (3^{9} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^9 is 19683, so (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, a8=9841, which is the 8th term in the sequence starting from a0=4.\n\nWait, so perhaps the total number of terms in the sum is 9, but the formula gives sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = 9841.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost layer is 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but that's not matching our earlier result of 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem, we have 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4 = sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another term, so after 9 layers, the sum would be sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, that's exactly a9 in our earlier computation.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but the sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but in the earlier approach, when I thought of the number of layers as 9, I thought of n=8 in the formula because a0=4, a1=13, etc., up to a8=29524.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion arises from whether we're starting the count from 0 or 1.\n\nIn any case, the result is consistent: 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a geometric series with 10 terms, since sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of terms.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k = 4.\n\nThen, each time we add another layer, we add another term in the sum.\n\nSo, if we have 9 layers, that would be sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of terms in the sum is 9, so sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, then multiplied by 3 gives 29523, which is different from our earlier result.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is whether the outermost layer is included in the sum or not.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), and the outermost layer is 3*(...).\n\nSo, the number of (1 + 3*(...)) layers is 9, each adding a new term.\n\nWait, so the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\n...\n\nUp to layer 9: 1 + 3*(previous layer) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut when I think of the sum as sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, each layer adds a term, so layer 1 corresponds to sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k = 4.\n\nLayer 2 corresponds to sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k = 13.\n\n...\n\nLayer 9 corresponds to sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nSum = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where r=3, n=10 terms (from k=0 to 9).\n\nSo, sum = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3 to get the total expression: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each time we add a layer, we're effectively adding another term in the series, so after 9 layers, we've added up to 3^9, making the sum from 3^0 to 3^9, which is 10 terms.\n\nSo, 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to look at it.\n\nSo, that confirms the result again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using exponentiation directly.\n\nWait, 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after all these methods and checks, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've spent enough time verifying the steps, and all methods point to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

It seems like there's a pattern where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but it's nested multiple times. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nAlright, let's start by looking at the innermost part of the expression. The innermost parentheses is just (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure. The expression is 1 + 3(...), where ... is the inner part. So, actually, it's 1 plus 3 times the inner expression. So maybe I need to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer separately to keep track. Let's number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9 or something. Wait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left, I see 9 opening parentheses, so there are 9 layers. That makes sense because each opening parenthesis is followed by a 1 + 3(...) structure.\n\nSo, let me start with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's 4. \n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2). So 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3). So 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4). That's 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5). So 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6). That's 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7). So 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). That's 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that. 3*29524. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nAnd 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an error with so many layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so all the steps check out. I think I did that right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can try another approach to confirm. Perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for such a sequence.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for Ln.\n\nGiven that L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWait, I notice that each Ln is 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\nLn = (a^n) * (L0) + (b*(a^n - 1))/(a - 1)\n\nBut wait, in our case, L1 is the first term, so maybe L0 is not defined. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is C*(3)^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve it.\n\nAssume the particular solution is a constant, say P.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nP = 3*P + 1\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*(3)^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to L1=4.\n\nSo, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nLn = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So that's a good check.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using a different method, which is always reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, expanding it, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nWait a second, I see a pattern here. Each layer adds another power of 3.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1\n\nL2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nL3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, in general, Ln = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k\n\nBut wait, that's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from k=0 to k=n.\n\nThe sum of such a series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula I derived earlier. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, L9 = sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nThis further solidifies that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYep, same result each time. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to write this expression in a different form, it's similar to a base-3 number or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. The step-by-step computation seems sufficient.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a deeply nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1+3. By computing each layer step by step, I was able to find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially until the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and even cross-verified using different methods like recurrence relations and geometric series. So, I feel very certain that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like there's a pattern here, so maybe I can work from the inside out. \n\nLet me start by writing down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, that's a lot of 1s and 3s.

So starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is another layer. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each layer wraps around that: 1 + 3(...), so each layer adds another 1 + 3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\" starting from the inside.

Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I define each layer as L1, L2, ..., up to L9, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working outwards. Let me try that.\n\nLet's define each layer as follows:\n\n- Let L1 = 1 + 3\n- Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n- L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n- And so on, until L9, which would be the innermost part.\n\nWait, but looking at the original expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is L1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is L1 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). So the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as L1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a new layer until we reach the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but when I computed up to L9, I got 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 L1\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 \u2192 L2\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 \u2192 L3\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 \u2192 L4\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 \u2192 L5\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 \u2192 L6\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 \u2192 L7\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 \u2192 L8\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 \u2192 L9\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to verify, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.

(1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nEach time, a new \"1 + 3(\" is added until we reach the outermost.\n\nCounting the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer adds one more, so the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, let me see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3(\", so the total number of layers is 9. Thus, L9 is the innermost part, and the outermost expression is 3*(L9).\n\nWait, no, actually, the outermost is 3*(L9), but in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1, and each layer wraps around that, so the outermost expression is 3*(L9), which is the entire expression.\n\nWait, but when I computed L9 as 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572, which should be the answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nCompute L1 to L9:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute L9 again:\n\nL8 = 9841\n\n3*L8 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nL9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, but given that it's only 9 layers, it's manageable to compute each one.\n\nWait, another approach: each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2K\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n=> 4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n=> 9/2 = 3C\n\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising.\n\nLet me check for n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\nYes, so the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost layer outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each layer is a similar structure: 3 times (1 plus 3 times something). So, maybe I can tackle this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually seems to work with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make sure I have it right. Starting from the inside:\n\nInnermost part: 1+3\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(result from the innermost)\n\nAnd this pattern continues, so each time I solve a layer, I plug it into the next one. Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think I'll have to compute nine layers. Let me count them to be sure.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nHmm, let me count the opening parentheses. There's one after the first 3, then each subsequent 1+3( starts another layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3( until the last one which is just 1+3. Let me count them: \n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3*(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3(1+3(...) parts. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+3(... So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are eight more layers. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the initial 3. \n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another 1+3( inside that\n3. Continuing this way, until the last one is 1+3.\n\nSo, perhaps there are nine layers in total, each time adding 1+3 inside another 3 times something. To be precise, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s multiplied by the number of parentheses. Wait, maybe I should count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the left: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the first parenthesis is after the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. \n\n1. 3(\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(\n3. Then another 1+3(\n4. And so on, until the last one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recursive expression. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is a multiplication by 3 of (1 plus the next layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, L3,... up to L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, with 1 being the innermost. So:\n\nL1: 1 + 3\nL2: 1 + 3*L1\nL3: 1 + 3*L2\n...\nL9: 1 + 3*L8\nAnd the entire expression is 3*L9\n\nWait, no. Actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Therefore, starting from L1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then L2 is 1 + 3*L1, L3 is 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that would be 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8). So, yes, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on until L9, then the total is 3*L9.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me check. If L1 is 4, then 3*L1 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That looks correct.\n\nProceeding to L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, moving on.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Got it.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Right.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nFinally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nWait, actually, that's breaking it down too much. Alternatively, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStart from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nNo more digits, so the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carry 0\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my computations because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might make an error.\n\nStarting from L1 to L9:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I don't see any miscalculations. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), computing each layer individually is feasible.\n\nLet me see if I can recognize a pattern or perhaps model this as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to model this. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. It's a good check because it confirms the step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be recognizing that the entire expression is a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nIf we let the innermost term be 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1.\n\nBut since we have a finite number of layers, it's a finite geometric series. Wait, but in this case, each term is dependent on the next, so it's more like a recursion than a series. But we've already solved it using the recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms, but I think the way we did it before is the most straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead to the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, it's best to start from the innermost one and work your way outward. So, let me try to parse this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression so I can see it more clearly. The entire expression is a series of terms where each term is 3 times (1 plus something). It seems repetitive, so maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit. But for now, I'll just take it one step at a time.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the innermost parentheses is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3):\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So, let's compute that.\n\n2. Compute 1 + 3*(4):\n   - First, compute 3*4 = 12\n   - Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so the next level out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\n3. Compute 1 + 3*(13):\n   - 3*13 = 39\n   - 1 + 39 = 40\n\nMoving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that.\n\n4. Compute 1 + 3*(40):\n   - 3*40 = 120\n   - 1 + 120 = 121\n\nContinuing outward, the next one is 1 + 3*(121). Let's do that.\n\n5. Compute 1 + 3*(121):\n   - 3*121 = 363\n   - 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext, moving outward, we have 1 + 3*(364). Let's calculate that.\n\n6. Compute 1 + 3*(364):\n   - 3*364 = 1092\n   - 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that.\n\n7. Compute 1 + 3*(1093):\n   - 3*1093 = 3279\n   - 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nMoving outward again, we have 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that.\n\n8. Compute 1 + 3*(3280):\n   - 3*3280 = 9840\n   - 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext, the expression is 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute that.\n\n9. Compute 1 + 3*(9841):\n   - 3*9841 = 29523\n   - 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, moving outward, we have 1 + 3*(29524). Let's calculate that.\n\n10. Compute 1 + 3*(29524):\n    - 3*29524 = 88572\n    - 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\n11. Compute 3*88573:\n    - 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 times 80,000 is 240,000. 3 times 8,000 is 24,000, which makes 264,000 so far. Then 3 times 573 is 1,719. Adding those together: 264,000 + 1,719 = 265,719. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Each time, the numbers got bigger quite quickly, which makes sense because multiplying by 3 each time leads to exponential growth.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip any or make a calculation error:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nEach step seems consistent, and I didn't notice any arithmetic errors upon reviewing. So, I think the final answer is 265,719.\n\nWait a second, let me check one more time because the numbers are quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication. Let me verify step 10 again: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*88573:\n\nLet me compute 88573 * 3:\n\n3*3=9.\n\n3*7=21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8=24 +2=26.\n\nSo, writing it down: 265,719. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlright, so I think I've got the correct answer after carefully working through each step. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the inside and move outward, solving each layer one by one.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Each part inside the parentheses is of the form 1 + 3(...), and each time, the next part is another 1 + 3(...). There are nine layers here, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses to confirm.\n\nStarting from the left: the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, counting the opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Okay, so there are nine layers of parentheses. That means I'll have to compute each layer starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1+3) at the very end.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step to keep track.\n\nLet's denote each layer as Layer 1 to Layer 9, where Layer 1 is the innermost one and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, starting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThat's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2, which is the next one outwards. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me calculate that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the expression simplifies to:\n\n3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me calculate that. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 equals 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems correct:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 another way:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nSame result.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute Layer 9 again:\n\nLayer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as Layer 1 to Layer 9, where Layer 1 is the innermost one and Layer 9 is the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the innermost parentheses and work your way outward. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make it a bit clearer. It's a series of 1s and 3s, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by the previous result. Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I see a (1+3), then another layer outside it. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(previous result))\n3. Each time, this pattern repeats.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me make sure I did each step correctly. It's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Yes.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so total is 3000+270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*L9 = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524*3 is a big number. Alternatively, I can compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer builds upon the previous one, and after computing all layers, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 4\n\nL2: 13\n\nL3: 40\n\nL4: 121\n\nL5: 364\n\nL6: 1093\n\nL7: 3280\n\nL8: 9841\n\nL9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting confused.\n\nSo, the innermost part of the expression is the last set of parentheses: (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3(...)). But wait, I just computed the innermost one, so let me substitute that result into the next level. So the next expression becomes:\n\n2. Compute (1 + 3 * 4). Wait, no, actually, looking back, I think I misread that. Each level is (1 + 3*(...)). So after the first innermost, it's 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So let me correct that.\n\nLet me write down each level step by step:\n\nLevel 1 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, so 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo Level 2: 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 3: 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 4: 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 5: 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 6: 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 7: 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 8: 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLevel 9: 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9), so:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000.\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000.\n\nNext, 3*500 = 1500.\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72.\n\nWait, but that might not be the correct way. Let me do it properly:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method.

Let me go through each level again quickly:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is built as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*previous term, and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So if I let a_n be the value at level n, then a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to level 9, which corresponds to the innermost being level 1, then each level up to 9, then the outermost 3*(level 9).\n\nSo, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 levels, so n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence, or find a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods confirm the same answer. So I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Start with the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Work outward level by level:**\n   - Each level is computed as 1 + 3*(result from the previous level).\n\n3. **Compute each level step by step:**\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply the outermost coefficient:**\n   - The entire expression is 3*(Level 9 result) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure this out. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the inside out. \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple instances of \"1 + 3(...)\", and each time, the inner part is another similar expression. So, perhaps I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way outward. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order of operations, so starting from the inside is the right approach.\n\nLet me write down the structure of the problem to visualize it better. The outermost layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, there are more layers. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another \"1 + 3(...)\" until we get to the outermost one. Let me count:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me check. The problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps another 1+3 around it. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n10. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) )\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers of nesting. Let me check again. Each time I add another 1+3, so starting from the innermost as 1, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Hmm, maybe it's better to approach this by working from the inside out, calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression and work our way out. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*4. First, 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*13. 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 3).\n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4).\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nMoving outward, next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 5).\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*364. 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6).\n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 7).\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8).\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 9).\n\nStep 10: Compute 3*29524. Let's calculate that. 3*29524. Well, 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, adding those together, 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n- The digits are 88572. So that's correct.\n\nSo, after working through each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward, I end up with the result 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of nesting, right? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) )\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, each adding another \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nWait, but when I did my steps, I went from step 1 to step 10, but maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\n- Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (innermost)\n- Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n- Step 10: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\" and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, that's correct. Each step corresponds to moving out one layer, so 9 steps to compute the inner expressions, then the 10th step is the final multiplication by 3.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have just 1 layer: 3(1 + 3). That would be 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Alternatively, if I compute it step by step as per my method:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 3*(4) = 12. Correct.\n\nNow, with two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nLet me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nCompute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work. Therefore, applying it to the original problem with 9 layers should give me the correct result.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each step manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost layer, and a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so each step is scaling the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by a common ratio, but here, we also add a constant each time, making it a bit more complex.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, whether computing step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, verified the pattern with smaller examples, derived a formula, and confirmed that both methods give the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost outwards.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Layer:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each part is of the form 3 times something in parentheses, and inside each parentheses, it's 1 plus another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of these operations. Let me try to parse this from the inside out because that's usually how you handle nested parentheses.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way outward, it'll be easier to compute. So, the innermost part is 1+3, right? Let me check how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1+3(...), and this repeats several times. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nHmm, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count again. Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another set. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The very innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3(...)\n3. So, each time, we have an expression that's 1 plus 3 times something.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of this as a recursive expression. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 is (1+3), L2 is 1 + 3*L1, L3 is 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9, which is the entire expression. Then, the final result would be 3*L9, since the entire expression is 3*(...).\n\nWait, no. Let me check. The entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me define L1 as the innermost (1+3). Then L2 is 1 + 3*L1, L3 is 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L9, and then the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I look at the expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*L1), where L1 is the next layer, which is 3*(1 + 3*L2), and so on. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me try to count the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each 3 is followed by a (1+3(...)) expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), then inside that, another 3 followed by (1+3(...)), and this repeats. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the first 3, let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \n2. Inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because I can see that from the innermost (1+3), each time we have a layer that's 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I start from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1, then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as the innermost is (1+3), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1+3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)), and so on, until we have 9 layers. Hmm, but I'm not sure if it's 9 layers or 8. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time, after a 3, it's followed by (1+3(...)). Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nFrom the outermost 3, we have:\n\n3(1+3(...)) \n\nInside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Each time, after a 3, there's a (, so starting from the first 3, that's the first layer, then each subsequent 3 inside adds another layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of 3s before each (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of times \"3*\" appears. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3* is followed by (1 + 3*...)\n- Then inside that, another 3* is followed by (1 + 3*...)\n- This continues until the innermost (1 + 3), which doesn't have another 3* after it.\n\nSo, how many 3*s are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each time inside, another 3. So, the number of 3*s is 9, because each layer adds another 3*. Let me check:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on, until the 9th layer, which is 3*(1 + 3)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers because from the outermost 3, we have 8 more layers inside. Let me check:\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1+3), which is layer 2, then 1 + 3*(layer 2), which is layer 3, and so on, until layer 9, which would be the outermost layer before the final 3*.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\n- Let L1 = 1 + 3\n- L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n- L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n- L4 = 1 + 3*L3\n- L5 = 1 + 3*L4\n- L6 = 1 + 3*L5\n- L7 = 1 + 3*L6\n- L8 = 1 + 3*L7\n- L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, L2 is 1 + 3*L1, and so on, until L9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times L9.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with the innermost being (1 + 3). So, each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer, starting from the innermost. So, if I compute L1 to L9 as I did above, then the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nCompute L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nCompute L2:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nCompute L3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nCompute L4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nCompute L5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nCompute L6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nCompute L7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nCompute L8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nCompute L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, so:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 29000 + 524.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3 = 3000\n\n90*3=270\n\n3*3=9\n\nSo, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000\n\n200*3=600\n\n80*3=240\n\nSo, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding it step by step, without defining layers, just to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute the innermost parentheses first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time replacing the innermost expression with its value.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nExpression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me start replacing from the innermost:\n\nInnermost part: (1+3) = 4\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYes, same result. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nFor n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nWait, but let me see: when we defined L1 as 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4, then L2 is a_2 = 13, and so on up to L9 = a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) as a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer, so if we expand it all, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^k, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nWait, no, because each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so it's more like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, the number of terms is finite, so it's a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of a sum.\n\nLet me try to see.\n\nIf I have L9 = 1 + 3*L8, and L8 = 1 + 3*L7, and so on, then expanding L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L7\n\nSimilarly, L7 = 1 + 3*L6, so:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*L6) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L6\n\nContinuing this way, after expanding all the way, L9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, because there are 9 layers, from L1 to L9, and each time we add a power of 3.\n\nWait, let me check: If L1 is 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1.\n\nThen L2 is 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, indeed, each L_n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, except that L1 starts at k=1. Wait, no, L1 is 1 + 3, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nSo, L1 = 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nL2 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nL3 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nAnd so on, up to L9, which would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because L9 is 1 + 3*L8, which would be 3^0 + 3*(L8), but L8 is 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^7.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each L_n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. So, for example, L1 is 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nL3 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which matches.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nThus, L9 would be sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, L9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but since the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k), which is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same result, 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers, the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\n2. **Start from the innermost layer**: Compute the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n3. **Compute each subsequent layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply the outermost 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

I can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So there are nine layers of parentheses. That means I'll need to work from the innermost parentheses outwards. \n\nAlright, let's start by writing down the expression clearly. Maybe I'll rewrite it with some spacing to make it easier to visualize.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Let's compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check that. So, the third layer from the inside is 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems right.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, that's correct.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That seems correct.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLet me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1092+1=1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 3279+1=3280. That's correct.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 9840+1=9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 29523+1=29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nCalculating 3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1.

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this. I think the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses and move outward. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting overwhelmed.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is \"1+3\". That seems straightforward. So, let me write that down:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is \"1 + 3(1 + 3)\". Wait, so that would be 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost expression. Since we already calculated that the innermost part is 4, let's substitute that in:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so that simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\". Again, we can substitute the previously calculated value of 13 into this:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, so that becomes 40. Let's keep going. The next layer out is \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\". Substituting our last result:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, that's 121. Continuing outward, the next expression is \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\". Substituting 121:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, that's a big jump. Let me double-check that multiplication. 3 times 121 is indeed 363, and adding 1 gives 364. Okay, that seems right.\n\nMoving on, the next layer is \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\". Substituting 364 here:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWow, that's a huge number. Let me make sure I did that correctly. 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Yep, that's correct.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\". Substituting 1093:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3 times 1093 is 3279? Let me check: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so yes, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNext layer out is \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\". Substituting 3280:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nHmm, 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That looks correct.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost layer, we have \"3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\". We've just calculated the innermost part to be 9841, so substituting that in:\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(9841) = ?\n\nLet me compute 3 times 9841. Breaking it down:\n\n9841 * 3:\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 800 * 3 = 2400\n- 40 * 3 = 120\n- 1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3 times 9841 is 29523.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 29523.\n\nWait a second, let me just go through each step again to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to get lost in all these layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Finally, 3*9841 = 29523\n\nYes, each step follows logically from the previous one. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each time, I multiplied by 3 and added 1, except for the very last step where I just multiplied by 3.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the final answer should be 29523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Here are the key steps:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 9841 = 29523\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}."

I think the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses outward. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting overwhelmed.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is \"1+3\". That seems simple enough. So, let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, I see that this result is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. So the next expression would be:\n\n1 + 3*(previous result)\n\nSince the innermost was 4, the next step is:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so now that part simplifies to 13. Let's go one level out further. The next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so that simplifies to 40. I can see a pattern forming here, where each step involves taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me write this down for each level to keep track.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Then: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Then: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that. Each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, so that's 88573 at the outermost level before multiplying by the initial 3. But looking back at the original problem, it's 3 multiplied by all that. So I think I might have miscounted the number of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count how many times \"1+3(...)\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one level, and each time it's nested inside another \"1+3(...)\". Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"1+3\" is nested inside, so let's see how many times this happens.\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n2. Then, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nWait, but how many levels are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3(, there are nine \"1+3(\" before it closes. Wait, no, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"1+3\" is nested. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another level.\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 levels. So each \"1+3\" is inside the previous one, so we have 9 instances of \"1+3(...)\".\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I went up to 10 steps, which might have included the initial 3* outside. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent this as a recursive expression or recognize a pattern.\n\nWait, let me think of it as a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1.\n\nBut in this problem, how many times does this recursion occur? Let's see.\n\nWait, the innermost term is 1+3, which is a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\n\nWait, so if I have 10 terms, starting from a_0 = 1, then a_10 would be the outermost term before multiplying by 3. But in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), because each level is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0=1.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The innermost is a_1 = 1+3*1=4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\na_3 =1 + 3*13=40.\n\na_4=1 + 3*40=121.\n\na_5=1 + 3*121=364.\n\na_6=1 + 3*364=1093.\n\na_7=1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\na_8=1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\na_9=1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\na_10=1 + 3*29524=88573.\n\nWait, so the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*29524=88572. But wait, in my earlier calculation, I had a_10 as 88573, which would be 1 + 3*29524=88573, but that would be inside another 3*(...). Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting the levels.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again. It's 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine levels of \"1+3\". So perhaps the number of a_n terms is 9, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated up to a_10=88573, that would be if there were 10 levels, but the problem only has nine \"1+3\" instances after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recount. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 = 4 (a_1)\n2. 1+3*4 =13 (a_2)\n3. 1+3*13=40 (a_3)\n4. 1+3*40=121 (a_4)\n5. 1+3*121=364 (a_5)\n6. 1+3*364=1093 (a_6)\n7. 1+3*1093=3280 (a_7)\n8. 1+3*3280=9841 (a_8)\n9. 1+3*9841=29524 (a_9)\n10. 1+3*29524=88573 (a_10)\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. So, perhaps a_9 is the result before the final multiplication by 3. So, the total expression would be 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, a_10 was 88573, which would be if there was an extra level. So perhaps I'm off by one in the count.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new level, so starting after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each adding a level. So, the innermost is the 9th level, so a_9 would be 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my previous step-by-step, I went up to a_10=88573, which would be if there were 10 levels. So perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the original expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n10. (1+3(\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses, which would mean 10 levels, so a_10 would be the innermost. But that doesn't seem right because the innermost is 1+3, which is the 10th level. So, the outermost would be 3*(a_9).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level1) = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLevel3:1 +3*(Level2)=1 +3*13=40\n\nLevel4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLevel5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLevel6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLevel7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLevel8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLevel9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nLevel10:1 +3*29524=88573\n\nBut in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Level9), which would be 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Level10 was 88573, which would be if the expression were 3*(Level10). Hmm, perhaps I'm misaligning the levels.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost is 1+3. So, the innermost is 1+3=4, then the next is 1+3*4=13, and so on, up to the 9th level, which would be 1+3*previous_level. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that 9th level.\n\nSo, the 9th level would be 1 + 3*Level8.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nLevel1:4\n\nLevel2:13\n\nLevel3:40\n\nLevel4:121\n\nLevel5:364\n\nLevel6:1093\n\nLevel7:3280\n\nLevel8:9841\n\nLevel9:29524\n\nSo, the expression is 3*Level9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Level10:88573, which would be if I had an extra level. So perhaps the original problem has 9 levels, making the final result 88572.\n\nWait, but when I count the opening parentheses, I see 9 \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. So, that would mean 9 levels, so the final result is 3*Level9=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of a_10 as 88573, that would be if I had 10 levels. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of levels.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write out the entire expression step by step, ensuring I count correctly.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 =13\n3. Next:1 +3*13=40\n4. Next:1 +3*40=121\n5. Next:1 +3*121=364\n6. Next:1 +3*364=1093\n7. Next:1 +3*1093=3280\n8. Next:1 +3*3280=9841\n9. Next:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, after 9 levels, the value is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of a_10 as 88573, that would have been if I had one more level, but since the problem only has 9 levels, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by expanding the expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table to keep track:\n\nLevel | Calculation | Result\n-----|------------|-------\n1 | 1 + 3 | 4\n2 | 1 + 3*4 |13\n3 |1 +3*13|40\n4 |1 +3*40|121\n5 |1 +3*121|364\n6 |1 +3*364|1093\n7 |1 +3*1093|3280\n8 |1 +3*3280|9841\n9 |1 +3*9841|29524\n\nSo, after 9 levels, the result is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of a_10 as 88573, which would have been if I had another level, but I think that's where I went wrong. The problem has 9 levels inside the initial 3*(...), so the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by actually expanding the entire expression step by step, just to be thorough.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving out one level:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 =13\n\nNext level:\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) =1 + 39=40\n\nNext:\n\n4.1 +3*40=121\n\n5.1 +3*121=364\n\n6.1 +3*364=1093\n\n7.1 +3*1093=3280\n\n8.1 +3*3280=9841\n\n9.1 +3*9841=29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of 88573, which is one more than that. So, that was a mistake in counting the levels.\n\nTherefore, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, perhaps I can write the entire expression with the substitutions:\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define the innermost as E1:\n\nE1 =1 +3=4\n\nE2=1 +3*E1=1+12=13\n\nE3=1 +3*E2=1+39=40\n\nE4=1 +3*E3=1+120=121\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1+363=364\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1+1092=1093\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1+3279=3280\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1+9840=9841\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought of a_10 as 88573, which would have been if I had another level, but the problem only has nine levels inside the initial 3*(...), so that's why it's 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid now. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After nine levels, the result is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1+3). So, let's compute that first.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1+3)\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, let's compute that.\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\nWe just found that the result from step 1 is 4. So, 3*4 is 12. Then, adding 1 gives us 13.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 3*(1+3) is 3*4=12, then 1+12=13. Yep, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 2). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\nThe result from step 2 is 13. So, 3*13 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives us 40.\n\nWait a second, 3*13 is 39, and 1+39 is indeed 40. That seems correct.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 3). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\nResult from step 3 is 40. So, 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121.\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That looks right.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4).\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\nResult from step 4 is 121. 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nWait, 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 363 +1 is 364. Yep, correct.\n\nMoving on, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 5).\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\nResult from step 5 is 364. So, 3*364 is... Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1+1092=1093. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6).\n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\nResult from step 6 is 1093. So, 3*1093 is... Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives us 3280.\n\nWait, 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nMoving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 7).\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\nResult from step 7 is 3280. So, 3*3280 is... 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600, 9600 + 240=9840. Then, adding 1 gives us 9841.\n\nWait, 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 8).\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\nResult from step 8 is 9841. So, 3*9841 is... Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, 29400 +120=29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400, 29400 +120=29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 9).\n\nStep 10: Compute 3*(result from step 9)\nResult from step 9 is 29524. So, 3*29524 is... Let's compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 +27000=87000, 87000 +1500=88500, 88500 +60=88560, 88560 +12=88572.\n\nWait, let me make sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step builds on the previous one, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards. Each time, we compute the innermost expression, substitute it back into the outer expression, and repeat until we reach the outermost layer. \n\nLet me recap the steps just to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems consistent, so I think the final result is 88,572.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern here that could have been generalized instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's like a geometric series or something similar?\n\nWait, maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let's denote each step as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. Then, we can compute up to a_9, since there are 9 layers after the initial one. But in our problem, we had 8 layers after the initial (1+3). Wait, let me count the number of layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(...))\n3. Then another, up to 9 layers? Wait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside it is (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let's count how many times we have (1 + 3(...)):\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(...)\n2. Inside that: (1 + 3(...)\n3. Inside that: (1 + 3(...)\n4. Inside that: (1 + 3(...)\n5. Inside that: (1 + 3(...)\n6. Inside that: (1 + 3(...)\n7. Inside that: (1 + 3(...)\n8. Inside that: (1 + 3(...)\n9. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, so from the first 3, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). But when I computed earlier, I had 9 steps after the initial (1+3). So, maybe the total number of layers is 9, which would mean that the recurrence relation would go up to a_9.\n\nBut in any case, since I computed step by step, and each time it was consistent, I think the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this can be expressed as a geometric series. Let's see. Each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me recall. For a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*(a_0 - d/(c-1)) + d/(c-1). In this case, c=3 and d=1.\n\nSo, the solution would be a_n = 3^n*(a_0 - 1/(3-1)) + 1/(3-1) = 3^n*(a_0 - 1/2) + 1/2.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's see if that holds.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's check for n=1: a_1 = 4.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches our step 2.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which matches step 3.\n\nSo, using the general solution, let's find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers after the initial 3. Wait, let me clarify. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, but according to our earlier steps, we had 9 layers, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our step 9 result.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I computed step by step earlier.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each step, which is more efficient. But since I was practicing step-by-step computation, I went through each layer manually. It's good to know both methods: the step-by-step approach is helpful for understanding the process, while the formula is useful for computing it more efficiently, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated step by step starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer simplifies to a value that is substituted into the next outer layer until the entire expression is computed. \n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Substitute back into the next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Continue substituting each result into the next layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n4. Finally, multiply the outermost 3 by the last result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, I should start from the innermost one and work my way outwards. So, let me try to identify the innermost part here.\n\nLooking at the expression, it seems to start from the innermost parentheses and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by something. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 equals 4. Got that.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, looking again, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Hmm, let me make sure.\n\nWait, actually, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))))). So, each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each outer layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, maybe I should write this down step by step.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the structure is a bit different. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...). Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + ... parts. Starting from the left, each time after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, but looking back at the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So perhaps I should compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me try that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as a separate layer. Let me see:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me check if I've correctly numbered the layers. The innermost is Layer 9, and each subsequent layer is built upon that, so Layer 8, Layer 7, etc., up to Layer 1, which is the outermost. So, starting from Layer 9, each layer is computed as 3*(1 + previous layer). \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the total value would be 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might make the computation easier without having to compute each layer manually. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the layers, each time we compute 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me see if there's a recursive formula or a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nWait, no, actually, in my previous calculation, I started from the innermost as Layer 9, but perhaps it's better to index them from the innermost as L_1, then L_2, etc., up to L_9, which is the outermost. But perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the expression as a recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nIf I denote each nested expression as a term, then each term is 3*(1 + next term). So, starting from the innermost term, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next term is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on.\n\nSo, each term is defined as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), where a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers, so a_1 to a_9. Let me check that.\n\nWait, in the original expression, how many times does the 3*(1 + ... ) occur? Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... parts.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), so let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then moving out, each time adding another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer\n- Then 3*(1 + (1 + 3)) \u2192 2 layers\n- Then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1 + 3))) \u2192 3 layers\n- Continuing this way, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times 3(1 + ... appears.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), then inside that 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... terms.\n\nLet me see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on.\n\nSo, how many times does 3(1 + ... occur? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3(1 + ...)\n- Then inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n- This continues until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... terms. Each time, the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3(1 + ...).\n\nLet me see: starting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3(1 + ... appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo, starting after the first 3(1 + ...:\n\n1. The first (1 + 3(...\n2. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3? Let me count:\n\n- After the first 3(1 + ..., there's a ( before the next 3(...).\n- Then another ( before the next 3(...).\n- This continues until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, let me count the number of ( after the initial 3(1 + ...:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), the number of opening parentheses after that is 8, because each subsequent 3(...) adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times 3(1 + appears.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of 3(1 + ... terms. Let me see:\n\n- The outermost is 3(1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n- Repeating until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nFrom the expression, starting after the initial 3(1 + ..., each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... terms.\n\nI think there are 9 layers because each time you go deeper, you add another 3(1 + ... until the innermost (1 + 3). Let me check:\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen moving out, each layer adds another 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if there are 9 layers in total, then the outermost layer is layer 9.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had 9 layers, starting from layer 9 as (1 + 3) = 4, then layer 8 as 3*(1 + 4) = 15, etc., up to layer 1 as 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3(1 + ..., there's another 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... terms.\n\nStarting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count how many times 3(1 + ... appears.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1 + ..., each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... terms.\n\n- The first one is 3(1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n- And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does 3(1 + ... occur? Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3(1 + ..., each time, there's another 3(1 + ... until the innermost (1 + 3). So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1 + ...\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nThe number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1 + ... is 8, because each 3(1 + ... adds another opening parenthesis. So, that would mean there are 8 layers, right?\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where I had 9 layers. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the number of 3(1 + ... terms is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1 + ... So, in the given expression, after the initial 3(1 + ..., there are 8 more opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new 3(1 + ... term. Therefore, the total number of layers is 9: the initial 3(1 + ... plus 8 more layers.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because the initial 3(1 + ... is the first layer, then each opening parenthesis adds another layer. So, if there are 8 opening parentheses after the initial 3(1 + ..., that would make 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each opening parenthesis after the initial one adds another layer. So, let's see:\n\n- The first layer: 3(1 + 3(...))\n- The second layer: 3(1 + 3(...))\n- And so on, until the ninth layer, which is (1 + 3).\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting. Let me try to count the number of 3(1 + ... terms.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3(1 + ..., there's another 3(1 + ... So, how many times does 3(1 + ... occur?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + ... terms:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2192 1\n2. Inside that, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2192 2\n3. Continuing this way, each time we enter another 3(1 + ... until we reach (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times do we have 3(1 + ...? Let me see: starting from the first 3(1 + ..., each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ..., so the total number of 3(1 + ... terms is 9, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the expression as a nested function:\n\nLet me define f(n) as 3*(1 + f(n-1)), where f(1) = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, if f(1) is the innermost layer, then f(9) is the outermost layer, which is the value we're looking for. So, 36,084.\n\nBut let me verify if this is correct by computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with f(1) = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the multiplications and additions are accurate.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute f(9) again:\n\nf(8) = 12027\n\nSo, 1 + f(8) = 1 + 12027 = 12028\n\nThen, 3 * 12028 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3 * 12028:\n\n3 * 12000 = 36,000\n\n3 * 28 = 84\n\nSo, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 36,084.\n\nI think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically, and I've double-checked the final multiplication. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 9):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

It's a series of nested expressions where each one is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. That seems like a good strategy because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the inside, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see: \n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3)\n2. Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(result of step 1))\n3. Then the next one is (1 + 3*(result of step 2))\n4. And this continues until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears. Hmm, looking at the expression, it seems like there are nine instances of (1+3(...)). Let me check again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The first (1+3) is just 4.\n- Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n- The next layer would be 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n- Continuing this way, each time I compute the innermost expression and work my way out.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, after the first 3, there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, that means I need to compute this nine times, starting from the innermost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's define each layer as a step.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Then compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(result from Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(result from Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(result from Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(result from Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(result from Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(result from Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that. Because in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost nine layers, the final step is to multiply by 3.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost nine layers. So, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous result), and after nine such layers, the outermost is 3*(result of the ninth layer).\n\nWait, but in my earlier counting, I went up to Step 9 as 29524, but that would be after nine layers. So then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. Each time I have a \"1+3(\", so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1+3*(4)) = 13\n3. (1+3*(13)) = 40\n4. (1+3*(40)) = 121\n5. (1+3*(121)) = 364\n6. (1+3*(364)) = 1093\n7. (1+3*(1093)) = 3280\n8. (1+3*(3280)) = 9841\n9. (1+3*(9841)) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. The first parenthesis after 3 is (1+3(...), so that's the first layer.\n2. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, how many are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the first 3, there are nine instances of (1+3(...)). Let me count:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times \"1+3\" is used as the innermost expression. Let me try to write it out more clearly.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I have nine layers. Because sometimes when you count the number of layers, it's easy to miscount.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. The first ( is at position 1: 3(1+3(...)\n2. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3\" appears as a separate term. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer is (1+3*(...)). So, how many times does \"1+3\" appear as a separate term?\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(4)) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*(13)) = 40\n4. Then: (1 + 3*(40)) = 121\n5. Then: (1 + 3*(121)) = 364\n6. Then: (1 + 3*(364)) = 1093\n7. Then: (1 + 3*(1093)) = 3280\n8. Then: (1 + 3*(3280)) = 9841\n9. Then: (1 + 3*(9841)) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nLooking at the problem again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+3(\", each one adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\n- The first ( after 3: 1\n- Then each \"1+3(\" adds another (.\n\nSo, from the expression, after the initial 3, there are nine \"1+3(\" segments, each adding a new layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nTherefore, the number of layers is nine, so f(9) is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that by computing each step again:\n\n1. f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Then, 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me compute f(9) again step by step.\n\nCompute f(1) to f(9):\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is of the form f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2C\n\n=> 2C = -1\n\n=> C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nf(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n=> 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\n=> 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\n=> A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\nf(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9,\n\nf(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049.\n\nThus, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute f(9) again using the closed-form formula:\n\nf(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=9,\n\nf(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000.\n\n9000*3 = 27000.\n\n500*3 = 1500.\n\n20*3 = 60.\n\n4*3 = 12.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4?\n\nWait, 20000 + 9000 = 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524.\n\nSo, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\n9000*3 = 27000.\n\n500*3 = 1500.\n\n20*3 = 60.\n\n4*3 = 12.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, and also used a closed-form formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Compute the innermost part: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4.

Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Then each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous result. So, perhaps I can define each layer as a term and compute each term step by step.\n\nLet me assign variables to each level to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built by the previous one. Let me think.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082\n\nAnd so on, until a\u2089, since I count nine sets of parentheses. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3 times a big expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It seems like there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so perhaps I need to compute up to a\u2089.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, because the original expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times a big expression that has 8 layers? Let me check.\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression again.\n\nIt's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... and so on, until the innermost part is (1+3))). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). So:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3).\n\nThen moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. But the original expression is 3 multiplied by layer 9. So, perhaps I need to compute up to layer 9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, it's 9. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, so the outermost expression is 3 times layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I look at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by a big expression that has 8 layers inside. Let me see:\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nThen layer 2: (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n...\n\nUp to layer 9: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by layer 9.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute layer 1 up to layer 9, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built by the previous one.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is a\u2089, which is 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to just multiply directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a\u2099.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\na\u2081 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 29524\n\nI notice that each term is of the form a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence is a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a\u2099^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a\u2099^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na\u2099 = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na\u2081 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na\u2084 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089 = (3^(10) -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the inner expression is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence where each term is built by the previous one. Let \\( a_n \\) be the value of the expression at each layer:\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe innermost expression evaluates to \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It's a nested expression where each part is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and this happens multiple times. So, it's like a chain of operations, each time starting with 1, adding 3 times the result of the next inner expression.\n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to work from the innermost parentheses outward. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting confused. Let me write down each step as I go along.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is the last (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3.\n   So, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\n2. Compute 1 + 3*4.\n   First, multiply: 3 * 4 = 12.\n   Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out is again 1 + 3*(result from step 2). Let's compute that.\n\n3. Compute 1 + 3*13.\n   Multiply: 3 * 13 = 39.\n   Add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 3).\n\n4. Compute 1 + 3*40.\n   Multiply: 3 * 40 = 120.\n   Add 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4).\n\n5. Compute 1 + 3*121.\n   Multiply: 3 * 121 = 363.\n   Add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5).\n\n6. Compute 1 + 3*364.\n   Multiply: 3 * 364 = 1092.\n   Add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext, step 7: 1 + 3*(result from step 6).\n\n7. Compute 1 + 3*1093.\n   Multiply: 3 * 1093 = 3279.\n   Add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, step 8: 1 + 3*(result from step 7).\n\n8. Compute 1 + 3*3280.\n   Multiply: 3 * 3280 = 9840.\n   Add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: step 9: 1 + 3*(result from step 8).\n\n9. Compute 1 + 3*9841.\n   Multiply: 3 * 9841 = 29523.\n   Add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9).\n\n10. Compute 3*29524.\n    Multiply: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check these calculations because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake with multiplication or addition. Let me go through each step again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify this multiplication.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n- 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72.\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's 88,572, not 88,572. Wait, but in my initial calculation, I got 88,572, but in the problem statement, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check how many times the nesting occurs.\n\nLooking back at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)) sections: Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...), and the number of layers is 8, because the innermost is (1+3), then each next layer adds another 1+3*(...), up to 8 layers.\n\nWait, but when I did the steps, I went from step 1 to step 10, which might be incorrect because maybe I added an extra step. Let me recount the number of parentheses.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nEach layer adds another (1+3(...)) until we have 8 layers, I think.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the steps. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer, and there are 8 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, each step I did from 1 to 9 would correspond to each layer, and then the final step is multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, but in my initial steps, I had 10 steps, which might be one too many. Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Then, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), each time, and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Each time, starting from the innermost, it's:\n\n(1+3) => 1\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to Layer 8: (1+3(...))\n\nSo, that would mean 8 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), each time, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my calculation above, I had 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), which might be incorrect. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm including the innermost (1+3) as the first layer, but in reality, each (1 + 3*(...)) is a layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers earlier. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)) sections: Each time, starting from the innermost, we have 8 instances of (1+3(...)), so 8 layers, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, in that case, the layers would be 8, and then the final step is multiplying by 3.\n\nLet me recount with this in mind:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, so that's different from my initial calculation where I went up to 29524 and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But now, according to this recounting, the result should be 29523.\n\nWait, this is a problem because I must have miscounted the layers earlier. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 1\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) \u2192 2\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2192 3\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) \u2192 4\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) \u21925\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u21926\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) \u21927\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) \u21928\n\nWait, so that's 8 layers of (1 + 3(...)), each time. So, 8 layers, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, in my initial calculation, I went up to 9 layers, which is incorrect. Therefore, I think my recounting is correct now, and the result should be 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check again step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841:\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400 \u2192 total so far: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120 \u2192 total: 29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n1 * 3 = 3 \u2192 total: 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nTherefore, the correct result is 29,523.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went one layer too far, which led me to 88,572, which is incorrect. So, I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nTo make sure, let me write out the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer8) = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think the confusion arose because I initially thought there were 9 layers, but upon recounting, it's 8 layers, leading to the correct result of 29,523.\n\nLet me just verify each step once more to ensure there are no arithmetic errors.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 3*9,841 = 29,523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nI think that's correct. Initially, I made a mistake by considering one extra layer, but upon recounting, it's clear that there are 8 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), leading to the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with eight layers of (1 + 3*(...)), each computed step by step starting from the innermost. Each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the eighth, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523.\n\n$\\boxed{29523}$"

It seems like each part is similar, so maybe I can work from the inside out. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the parentheses, the innermost part is (1+3). So, I'll start there and work my way outward. Let's write that down:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the first step is 4. Now, moving one layer out, I see that this result is multiplied by 3. So, the next expression is 3*(previous result). Let me write that:\n\nSecond layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the structure is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next layer). So, maybe I should represent each step as 3*(1 + previous result). Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n10. Finally: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 3(1+...). Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1 + (1+3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3)))\n4. And so on, up to nine layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list each layer step by step, ensuring I have nine layers.\n\nLet me number them from the inside out as layers 1 to 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, that's only nine layers, but when I computed earlier, I ended up with 108255. But according to this, Layer9 is 36084, and then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). Wait, no, because in the problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps Layer9 is the innermost, and we have to go out nine times. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me look at the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's count the number of times we see \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are nine instances of \"1+3(\", meaning nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and working outward.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it as starting from the innermost and moving outward, each time computing the value step by step.\n\nLet me try that again, but this time, I'll make sure I count the layers correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but that's only nine layers, and according to the original expression, the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). So, after computing Layer9 as 36084, we need to compute the outermost expression, which is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, no, because Layer9 is already the result of 3*(1 + Layer8). So, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me clarify the structure. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then 3*(1 + (1+3)), then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3))), and so on, up to nine layers.\n\nSo, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nLet me try that again, more carefully:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers, so after Layer9, do we have another 3*(1 + Layer9)? Or is Layer9 the outermost?\n\nWait, looking back at the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(\" starts a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n- The first 3 is the outermost.\n\nThen, inside it, we have 1+3(...), which starts another 3(...\n\nSo, each \"3(\" corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...\n\nSo, there are nine \"3(\" after the initial one, meaning nine layers. Therefore, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and moving outward.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9 as 36084, that would be the result of the innermost expression. But the original expression has nine layers, so perhaps I need to compute one more layer after that.\n\nWait, no, because each \"3(\" corresponds to a layer, so nine layers mean that after computing Layer9, we don't have another layer. So, the final result would be Layer9, which is 36084.\n\nBut wait, when I computed earlier, I thought I had 108255, but that must have been a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me write the expression with placeholders to see how many layers there are.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, according to this, the result is 36084.\n\nBut wait, when I first computed, I thought I had 108255, but that must have been a mistake because I was adding an extra layer.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's parse it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each time it's 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, let's parse it from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after nine layers, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the result was 108255. That must have been incorrect because I was adding an extra layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3*(1+... in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" after the first one is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n- The first 3 is the outermost.\n\nThen, each \"3(\" inside is a new layer:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nSo, that's nine layers. Therefore, after computing Layer9, which is 36084, that's the final result.\n\nWait, but when I first computed, I thought I had 108255, which is 3*36084 + 3. That must have been a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the computation again:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1+4)=15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1+15)=48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1+48)=147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1+147)=444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1+444)=1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought the answer was 108255. Maybe I was working on a different problem. Let me confirm with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nThis looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested with multiplication and addition. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1})\n\nWith the base case L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, 3^n * 11/6 = (11/6)*3^n. Alternatively, we can write it as:\n\nL_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n(11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^n)/6 - 9/6 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nNow, let's compute L_9 using this formula.\n\nL_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, L_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n11 * 19683 = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nSo, total is 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nNow, subtract 9:\n\n216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n216,504 / 6 = ?\n\nWell, 216,504 \u00f7 6:\n\n6 * 36,000 = 216,000\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084\n\nTherefore, L_9 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nSo, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 108,255, which was wrong. So, the correct answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the formula because I might have made a mistake in deriving it.\n\nWe had L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1})\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nWe solved the recurrence and got L_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nTesting for n=1:\n\n(11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, which matches L_1.\n\nn=2:\n\n(11*9 -9)/6 = (99 -9)/6 = 90/6=15, which matches L_2=15.\n\nn=3:\n\n(11*27 -9)/6=(297-9)/6=288/6=48, which matches L_3=48.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, L_9=36,084.\n\nThus, the answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me check again the original problem. The user wrote:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWhich is nine layers of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the result is 36,084.\n\nBut earlier, I thought I had 108,255, which must have been a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of 3*(1+... in the expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3, each subsequent 3*(1+... is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"3(\" appears after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nYes, nine times. So, nine layers, leading to L_9=36,084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me compute it step by step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1+4)=15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1+15)=48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1+48)=147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1+147)=444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1+444)=1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it using the formula:\n\nL_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nFor n=9:\n\nL_9 = (11*19683 -9)/6 = (216,513 -9)/6 = 216,504/6 = 36,084.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36,084.\n\nI think earlier I might have confused the number of layers or made a calculation error, leading me to think it was 108,255, but that was incorrect. The correct result after carefully computing each layer is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\\)\n\nThus, the final result after evaluating all layers is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

It seems like each part is of the form 1 + 3(...), and this pattern repeats multiple times. Let me try to figure out how many layers there are here. \n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so let's count them. Starting from the innermost part: \n\n1+3 \n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3(...), so that's two layers. Let me see, each time I go out one layer, I add another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by something inside a parenthesis. \n\nWait, actually, each time it's 3 multiplied by a sum that starts with 1 and then another 3(...). So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(first layer)\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*(second layer)\n\nAnd this continues until the outermost layer. Let me count how many layers there are. \n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like nine layers. Let me check again. Each time I add a layer, I'm adding another 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I have the expression written as 3*(...), and inside that, another 3*(...), etc., how many times does this happen?\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first 3 is outside, then inside it's 1 + 3(...). So the first layer is 1 + 3*(second layer)\n- The second layer is 1 + 3*(third layer)\n- And so on until the ninth layer, which is 1 + 3*(10th layer?), but wait, actually, the innermost part is just 1 + 3, which is the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by working from the inside out. Let me start computing from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. That might be less confusing.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer (Layer 1): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So let's compute Layer 2.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out (Layer 3): 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The expression starts with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses before the last closing one. Wait, no, let me count:\n\nFrom the beginning:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo the structure is:\n\n3( ... )\n\nWhere the ... is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo inside the first parentheses, it's 1 + 3*(...), where ... has 8 more layers. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied by a term. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So each time, we're adding another layer.\n\nSo let's count how many times we do this.\n\nThe innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3 multiplied by a sum that has 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). Wait, no, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, no, let me make sure. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So how many layers are there inside the first 3*(...)? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, there are 9 instances of 1 + 3*(...). So that would be Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I computed before. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, which is the result of 1 + 3*Layer8. So that would be the value inside the first 3*(...). So the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside the first 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nSo that's 9 layers inside the first 3*(...). Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo the entire expression equals 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n\nSo 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I correctly identified the number of layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo that's 9 layers inside the first 3*(...). So the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again how many layers there are. The expression is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo each time, after the first 3, there are 9 instances of 1 + 3*(...). So yes, 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the inner expression is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me verify the value of 3^10 again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524.

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nAlright, let's try to parse this. It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Each level seems to be 3 multiplied by something that starts with 1 plus another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of these 1 + 3(...) terms, each multiplied by 3. \n\nI think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is 1+3. That seems simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another 1 + 3(...). The ... was the innermost part we just computed, which is 4. So, let's compute that next level.\n\nSo, 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 4, so:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so now that level evaluates to 13. Let me note that down. So, the next level out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's a bigger jump. So, that level is 40. Now, moving out another level, we have 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWow, that's getting big quickly. So, 121 is the result of that level. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nOkay, 364 is the next result. Continuing outward, the next level is 1 + 3*(364). Let me calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, that's a thousand something. Let me keep going. The next level is 1 + 3*(1093). Calculating that:\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nAlright, 3280. Next layer is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThat's almost ten thousand. Now, moving out another level, we have 1 + 3*(9841). Let's see:\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWow, that's over twenty-nine thousand. Next level is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nOkay, 88573. Now, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(88573). Let's calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720.\n\nAlright, so the innermost parentheses worked their way out, and now the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 265,720. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, the original problem is 3 times this big number.\n\nSo, 3 * 265,720. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 265,720. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\n265,720 * 3:\n\nFirst, 200,000 * 3 = 600,000.\n\n60,000 * 3 = 180,000.\n\n5,000 * 3 = 15,000.\n\n700 * 3 = 2,100.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000.\n\n780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000.\n\n795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100.\n\n797,100 + 60 = 797,160.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 265,720 * 3 should be 797,160. Let me verify:\n\n265,720 * 3:\n\n200,000 * 3 = 600,000.\n\n60,000 * 3 = 180,000. So, 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000.\n\n5,000 * 3 = 15,000. So, 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000.\n\n700 * 3 = 2,100. So, 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100.\n\n20 * 3 = 60. So, 797,100 + 60 = 797,160.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 265,720 = 797,160.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 797,160.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because that seems like a huge number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the earlier computations. Let me go through each step again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*265,720 = 797,160. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems like all steps are correct. So, the final answer is 797,160.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing the expression in another way. Maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nLet me denote each level as a term in a sequence. Let's say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\n\na_11 = 1 + 3*a_10 = 1 + 3*88573 = 265720.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_11 = 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try solving it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed terms to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nn=10: (177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. Correct.\n\nn=11: (531441 -1)/2=531440/2=265720. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works for each term. Therefore, the innermost term a_1 is 4, and each subsequent term is built upon the previous one using this formula.\n\nGiven that, the outermost expression is 3*a_11, where a_11 = (3^{12} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{12}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147, 3^12=531441.\n\nSo, a_11 = (531441 -1)/2 = 531440/2 = 265720.\n\nThen, 3*a_11 = 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the general formula, I arrive at the same result: 797,160.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. It's interesting how the numbers grow so rapidly because each term is multiplied by 3, leading to exponential growth.\n\nJust to recap, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and start evaluating from the innermost parentheses.\n2. Compute each level step by step, keeping track of the results.\n3. Alternatively, identify the pattern and derive a formula for the nth term, which allows for a more straightforward computation.\n4. Verify the formula with known values to ensure its correctness.\n5. Apply the formula to find the required term and then multiply by 3 as per the original expression.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also reinforced the importance of double-checking work, especially with large numbers, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{797160}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue evaluating each level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720 \\]\n\n4. The outermost expression is:\n   \\[ 3 \\times 265720 = 797160 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{797160}\\)."

It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards might be the best approach. \n\nLet me write this out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. I'll label each step so I don't get confused.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer:** The very inside is 1+3. Let me compute that first.\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Next Layer Out:** Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the result from the innermost layer. Wait, no, actually, looking again, each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). So maybe I need to work from the inside out, each time computing the innermost expression first and substituting it into the outer expression.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer step by step, then substitute that value into the next layer. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, starting from L1:\n\n- **L1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n- **L2:** 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n- **L3:** 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n- **L4:** 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n- **L5:** 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n- **L6:** 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n- **L7:** 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n- **L8:** 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n- **L9:** 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 times (1 + ...). So after computing L9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, final step:\n\n- **Final Result:** 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 +1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 +2 =8, write down 8.\n- 9*3 =27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n- 2*3 =6 +2=8, write down 8.\nWait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 =12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 +3=4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 =4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. Let me see if that's feasible.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find A and B.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C +1\n\nC -3C =1\n\n-2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute each layer step by step again to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 +3 =4\n2. 1 +3*4=13\n3. 1 +3*13=40\n4. 1 +3*40=121\n5. 1 +3*121=364\n6. 1 +3*364=1093\n7. 1 +3*1093=3280\n8. 1 +3*3280=9841\n9. 1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) step by step, but maybe using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer and then substitute, but I think I've done that already.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expression from the inside out, layer by layer, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 +3 =4\n2. Then, moving out, 1 +3*(4) =13\n3. Next layer: 1 +3*(13)=40\n4. Next: 1 +3*(40)=121\n5. Next:1 +3*(121)=364\n6. Next:1 +3*(364)=1093\n7. Next:1 +3*(1093)=3280\n8. Next:1 +3*(3280)=9841\n9. Next:1 +3*(9841)=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expression using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, the expression a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence, which we've already solved, so perhaps that's the most efficient way.\n\nBut since I've already confirmed it step by step and using the formula, I think I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\n1. L1: 1+3=4\n2. L2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n3. L3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n4. L4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n5. L5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n6. L6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n7. L7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8. L8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9. L9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me start by writing down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nI notice there are nine sets of parentheses here.

Let's see:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nSo, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nSo, Layer 2: 13\n\nNext, Layer 3 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but okay.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nHmm, that's getting large quickly.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\n1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nWow, this is growing exponentially. Let me keep going.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\n1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Plus 1 is 1093.\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\n1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Plus 1 is 3280.\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\n1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nNow, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\n1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Plus 1 is 29524.\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems really big. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me verify the multiplication step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me do it properly.\n\nWait, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, we have 1 + 3*(something). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, etc.\n\nSo, if I list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see the sequence of numbers:\n\n4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n4*3 +1=13.\n\n13*3 +1=40.\n\n40*3 +1=121.\n\n121*3 +1=364.\n\n364*3 +1=1093.\n\n1093*3 +1=3280.\n\n3280*3 +1=9841.\n\n9841*3 +1=29524.\n\nYes, that's the pattern. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1.\n\nSo, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*previous +1.\n\nTherefore, if I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula, maybe I can compute it more efficiently.\n\nBut since there are only nine layers, computing step by step as I did is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThen, a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on up to a_9=29524.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing a_9, and then multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th term.\n\nBut in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, a_9=29524, so 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found as follows.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2 = 3A => 9/2 =3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the original expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the exponents.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying the recurrence relation, and using the closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3(...). To solve it, we compute each layer starting from the innermost one and work our way outward. Each layer can be represented by a recurrence relation, which allows us to find a closed-form formula for the nth term. Using this formula, we compute the value of the innermost expression and then proceed outward until we reach the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). The outermost operation is multiplying the innermost result by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: The entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last 1 + 3. Let me write that down:\n\nStart with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So, since the innermost was 1 + 3 = 4, the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I might have messed that up. Let me check again. The next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 4, so it's 1 + 3*4, which is indeed 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that seems right.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). So, 3*13 = 39, and then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me make sure I'm following the structure correctly. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result, right? So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, that seems like a big jump. Let me verify each step carefully.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or miscalculate. Maybe I should write each step down clearly.\n\nLet me number each layer from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000,\n\n3*9000 = 27000,\n\n3*500 = 1500,\n\n3*24 = 72.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000,\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500,\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly. There are 9 layers inside, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...):\n\n1. 3(...)\n\n2. 3(...)\n\n3. 3(...)\n\n4. 3(...)\n\n5. 3(...)\n\n6. 3(...)\n\n7. 3(...)\n\n8. 3(...)\n\n9. 3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 3 multiplied by something, starting from the innermost 1 + 3. So, I think I did 9 layers correctly, ending up with 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, this is a geometric sequence perhaps?\n\nWait, let me think about that. If I have a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term, starting from 4, then the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, etc.\n\nLet me see if I can find a general formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value at each layer.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2,\n\nand so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found because it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1,\n\nA - 3A = 1,\n\n-2A = 1,\n\nA = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2,\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2,\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2,\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, especially with the exponents.\n\n3^1 = 3,\n\n3^2 = 9,\n\n3^3 = 27,\n\n3^4 = 81,\n\n3^5 = 243,\n\n3^6 = 729,\n\n3^7 = 2187,\n\n3^8 = 6561,\n\n3^9 = 19683,\n\n3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 = 59048,\n\n59048 / 2 = 29524,\n\n3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, that seems right.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous result, leading to a geometric progression. Using the derived formula for the nth term of this sequence, we find the value at the 9th layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1 + 3) equals 4. Got that. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). Wait, let me make sure I'm tracking the layers correctly.\n\nWait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a (1 + something). Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...).

Then, L3: (1 + 3*L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check.\n\nWait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah.\n\nThen, L4: (1 + 3*L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nThen, L5: (1 + 3*L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay.\n\nL6: (1 + 3*L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093.\n\nL7: (1 + 3*L6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280.\n\nWait, 3*1093: Let me compute it step by step to be accurate.\n\n1093 * 3:\n\n3*1000 = 3000\n\n3*90 = 270\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nSo, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279\n\nThen, 3279 + 1 = 3280. So, L7 is 3280.\n\nL8: (1 + 3*L7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280:\n\n3*3000=9000\n\n3*280=840\n\nSo, 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\nThen, 9840 + 1 = 9841\n\nSo, L8 is 9841.\n\nL9: (1 + 3*L8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*800=2400\n\n3*40=120\n\n3*1=3\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 29523 + 1 = 29524\n\nSo, L9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo, 3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading from the bottom up: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLet me recap each layer:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check L3 again. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again, just to be thorough.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident with this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure out how to approach this. I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the expression is a series of 3s and 1s with a lot of parentheses. Let me try to write it out step by step, starting from the innermost part.\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The innermost (1+3) is replaced with 4, so the next layer out is (1 + 3*(result)). So, the next layer is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now, replacing the next innermost part with 13, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 13))))))))\n\nAlright, moving out another layer. The next innermost is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression is now:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 40)))))))\n\nNext layer out: (1 + 3*40). Let me calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 121)))))))\n\nMoving out another layer: (1 + 3*121). Hmm, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nReplacing that, the expression is now:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 364)))))\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*364). Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 1093)))))\n\nNext step: (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nReplacing that, the expression is now:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3280))))\n\nMoving out another layer: (1 + 3*3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 9841)))\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nReplacing that, the expression is now:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 29524))\n\nMoving out another layer: (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is... wait, maybe I should compute it differently. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 88573))\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*88573). Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 73*3=219. So, adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 219 = 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720.\n\nReplacing that, the expression is now:\n\n3(1 + 265720)\n\nNow, the next layer is (1 + 3*265720). Let me compute 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 65720*3=197160. Wait, no, 265720 is 200000 + 65720, so 200000*3=600000, 65720*3: 60000*3=180000, 5720*3=17160. So, 180000 + 17160 = 197160. Then, 600000 + 197160 = 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(797161)\n\nNow, the outermost layer is just 3 multiplied by 797161. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 797161. Let me break it down:\n\n700000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n\n7,000 * 3 = 21,000\n\n100 * 3 = 300\n\n60 * 3 = 180\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to compute 797,161 * 3:\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n\n7,000 * 3 = 21,000\n\n100 * 3 = 300\n\n60 * 3 = 180\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nWait, but that seems off because 797,161 * 3 should be:\n\nLet me compute 797,161 * 3 step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n6 * 3 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n1 * 3 = 3 + 1 (carry) = 4\n\n7 * 3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 (carry) = 29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 (carry) = 23, write down 3, carry over 2.\n\nThere's nothing left, so write down 2.\n\nWait, that would be 2,391,483. Hmm, but let me confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 797,161 * 3:\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n\n7,000 * 3 = 21,000\n\n100 * 3 = 300\n\n60 * 3 = 180\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the earlier steps, which would throw off all the subsequent calculations.\n\nLet me go back through each step quickly:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\n13. Finally: 3*797161 = 2,391,483.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 2,391,483.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing the expression from the inside out again, step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nFinally: 3*797161 = 2,391,483.\n\nYes, same result. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 2,391,483.\n\nI was a bit worried when I saw all those parentheses, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. It's like peeling an onion; each layer revealed the next step. I just had to make sure I computed each multiplication correctly before moving on to the next layer. It's easy to make a small mistake in arithmetic, especially with larger numbers, so double-checking each step is essential. But since each step built on the previous one without any discrepancies, I'm pretty sure the final answer is correct.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that each layer follows a similar pattern: 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, it's almost like a recursive formula where each step depends on the one before it. This kind of structure is actually quite common in mathematics, especially in sequences and series. It's interesting how the numbers grow exponentially as we move outward, which makes sense because we're multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. That's similar to a geometric series, but with an added constant at each step.\n\nI wonder if there's a general formula for expressions like this. Let's say we have an expression like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). If we have n layers, is there a closed-form expression to compute this without expanding each layer? That might be an interesting problem to explore, but for now, since the problem only has nine layers, expanding step by step was feasible.\n\nIn any case, I think I've solved the problem correctly by carefully working through each layer and verifying my calculations. It was a bit time-consuming, but patience is key when dealing with nested expressions to avoid mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each step involves computing the innermost expression, then substituting the result into the next layer, and repeating this process until the entire expression is simplified.\n\nHere's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7.

Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n    - \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\)\n\n11.

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses and threes. I think the key here is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me try to visualize this. It's like a Russian doll situation where each layer has another layer inside it. So, I'll need to compute the innermost expression first and then use that result to compute the next one, and so on, until I get to the outermost part.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. Maybe if I number each layer, it'll help me keep track. Let's see, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is 1+3. That's simple enough.\n2. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n3. And this pattern continues, with each layer adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. That way, I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet's get started.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses (Layer 1)**\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1).\n\n**Step 2: Compute Layer 2**\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it, Layer 2 is 13. Next, moving out to Layer 3.\n\n**Step 3: Compute Layer 3**\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going.\n\n**Step 4: Compute Layer 4**\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Moving on.\n\n**Step 5: Compute Layer 5**\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364. Hmm, the numbers are getting bigger quickly. Let's proceed.\n\n**Step 6: Compute Layer 6**\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093. Next layer.\n\n**Step 7: Compute Layer 7**\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWhoa, Layer 7 is 3280. This is getting large. Let's continue.\n\n**Step 8: Compute Layer 8**\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer.\n\n**Step 9: Compute Layer 9 (the outermost parentheses)**\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result, right?\n\n**Final Step: Compute the entire expression**\nTotal expression: 3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000\n\nNext, 500*3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20*3 = 60\n\nAnd 4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, let me go through the layers again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step follows logically, and I don't see any arithmetic errors in each layer. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or something, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. If it were more layers, maybe a different approach would be better, but here, step-by-step computation is feasible.\n\nAnother way to verify is to compute each layer in a table:\n\n| Layer | Calculation               | Result |\n|-------|----------------------------|--------|\n| 1     | 1 + 3                      | 4      |\n| 2     | 1 + 3*4                    | 13     |\n| 3     | 1 + 3*13                   | 40     |\n| 4     | 1 + 3*40                   | 121    |\n| 5     | 1 + 3*121                  | 364    |\n| 6     | 1 + 3*364                  | 1093   |\n| 7     | 1 + 3*1093                 | 3280   |\n| 8     | 1 + 3*3280                 | 9841   |\n| 9     | 1 + 3*9841                 | 29524  |\n| Total | 3*29524                    | 88572  |\n\nLooking at this table, each result builds on the previous one correctly. So, I feel confident that the final answer is accurate.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute one of the layers again. Let's pick Layer 5: 1 + 3*121.\n\n121 * 3 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093 * 3 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841 * 3 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nAnd finally, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nAlright, so after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each calculation, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by adding 1 and multiplying by 3, starting from 1+3 and proceeding through each subsequent layer until the outermost parentheses are reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nAlright, let's write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each set is of the form 1 + 3(something). So, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me number these parentheses from the inside out to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: 1 + 3(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost one.\n\nSo, let's start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses (1 + 3)**\nThat's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4.\n\nSo, the expression now becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm updating correctly. The innermost part was (1 + 3), which is 4, so the next layer out is 1 + 3*(4). Let me correct that.\n\nActually, perhaps I should represent each step as substituting the innermost value and then computing the next layer. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote each layer as Layer 1 to Layer 9, starting from the innermost.\n\n**Layer 1: (1 + 3)**\nCompute this first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result)**\nSo, that's 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on, is that correct? Because in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result)**\nSo, 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result)**\n1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result)**\n1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result)**\n1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result)**\n1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result)**\n1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result)**\n1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, so after computing all the layers, the outermost parentheses result in 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result.\n\nSo, the final computation would be 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 3 * 29000 = 87000.\n\n3 * 524 = 1572.\n\nSo, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n= 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, did I compute each layer correctly? Let me go through each step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here.\n\nLooking at the structure of the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nLet me write down the recursion:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did before. So, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this recursion with a formula instead of computing each term step by step. Let's see.\n\nThe recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous part: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value we got earlier. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the outermost parentheses evaluate to 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n= 88572.\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nPerfect, same result.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation formula, and double-checking the final multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)} \\). Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing all layers, the outermost parentheses result in 29524. Then, we multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like it's a series of 1s and 3s multiplied together in a nested fashion. I think the way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of nested parts, I see that there are nine sets of parentheses. Each one starts with 1 + 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the result of the next inner expression.\n\nLet me try to evaluate this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). That would be 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). That's 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). So, 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). That is 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Therefore, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9). That's 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each step again to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. Wait, 3280 is 3000 + 200 + 80, so 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\n10. Now, the outermost layer: 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression has nine layers of (1 + 3(...)), and each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That seems like it's forming a geometric series or something similar. Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each step manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches the steps I took earlier.\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Since a_1 corresponds to n=1, so a_9 is when n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the result I got earlier by computing each step manually. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify a couple of the steps again.\n\nAt step 5, a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nAt step 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nWait, no, that's not the correct way to compute 29524 * 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value at each step until reaching the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Expression**: Start with (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. **Next Layer**: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. **Next Layer**: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n4. **Next Layer**: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. **Next Layer**: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. **Next Layer**: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n7. **Next Layer**: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n8. **Next Layer**: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n9. **Next Layer**: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n10. **Outermost Layer**: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nAlright, so it's a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. Let me try to parse this from the inside out, since each part is contained within parentheses. I think the way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nHmm, that's a lot of 1s and 3s. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...), and each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(result from above)\n3. Then another layer: 1 + 3*(result from previous)\n4. And so on, until we have nine layers in total, I think.\n\nWait, let me check: the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside that, it's 3(1 + 3(...)), so each time, it's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another set. Let me count: starting from the first 3, then each 3(1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nStarting with the first 3, then each layer is 3(1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of innermost expressions. Let me try to write it as layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd this continues until Layer 9, I think. Because I can see that the expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, let's consider that there are 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times the pattern 1 + 3(...) appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...), and each time, that's a new layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the outermost 3*(Layer 9). So, total layers would be 9.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, each step adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"3(\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3( adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2013 so, how many 3( are there? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one layer.\n\nThen inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), so that's two layers.\n\nContinuing, each time another 3(1 + 3(...)), so by the time I get to the innermost part, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) \u2013 that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outwards, each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is Layer 1, and each time we go outwards, it's another layer up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(Layer 9) would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a bit high. Let me check my calculations again, maybe I missed a layer or miscalculated somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in this case, a_1 is 4, a_2 is 13, a_3 is 40, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find D. Let me assume a particular solution is a constant, so a_n = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D.\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because all our terms are positive. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to solve the recurrence relation step by step.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the standard approach for linear recurrences is as follows:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the 9th layer is a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step without using the formula, just to be thorough.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula I derived: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nwe start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me note that down.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 is 4. That seems straightforward. Now, moving one level out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, let me check the structure again. Each level is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result from the previous step. \n\nWait, maybe I should represent this as a recursive expression. Let me see. Let's define each level as a term. Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, the number of levels is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears, which is 9 times. So, I think I need to compute from Level 1 up to Level 9, and then multiply by 3 at the end, right?\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the original expression, the entire thing is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps after computing the innermost part, each subsequent level is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and this is done 9 times, and then the final result is multiplied by 3 again. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try writing it step by step.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n\n...\n\nContinuing up to a\u2089, since there are 9 nested expressions. Then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nWait, let me check that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine levels. So, yes, each a_i is defined as 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then, the total expression is 3*a\u2089. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let's compute each a_i step by step.\n\nStarting with a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, so 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*29,000 = 87,000\n\nThen, 3*524 = 1,572\n\nAdding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each a_i step because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a small error.\n\nStarting again:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, a\u2086=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279; so 3000+279=3279. Thus, a\u2087=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Thus, a\u2088=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\nFirst, 3*9000=27,000\n\n3*800=2,400\n\n3*40=120\n\n3*1=3\n\nAdding these together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of levels. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Each time, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent is 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Hmm, perhaps it's 9 levels as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of '1+3's. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so each level adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...) is 9 times, right? Because from the innermost, each layer is one more 1 + 3*(...). So, a\u2081 to a\u2089, each a_i is 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, yes, I think 9 levels is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_i to avoid computing each step manually, especially if there were more levels. But since there are only 9, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, this recursive formula might have a closed-form solution. Let me think about it. The recurrence relation is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has a solution of the form a_i = C*3^i.\n\nThen, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_i = C*3^i + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for i = 9:\n\na\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with the formula.\n\nSince a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2, then a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nWait, another approach: The expression inside is a geometric series. Let me denote S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 levels. Then, S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the same expression with one fewer level, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 8 levels. But this might not be as straightforward as using the recurrence relation.\n\nI think the way I did it initially is correct, so I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make absolutely sure, let me recompute the step-by-step a_i values:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression step by step, expanding each layer:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nThen: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nThen: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent with all previous computations. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60,000\n\n9000*3 = 27,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the innermost parentheses and work your way outward. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple instances of \"1+3(...)\", each time multiplied by 3. It looks like there are several layers here. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I see a \"1+3(...)\" expression, that's a new layer. Let me count: \n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(...)\n3. Then another, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, each time it's 1 + 3 multiplied by another expression. Let me try to parse it more carefully.\n\nThe entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). That something is another (1 + 3 times something else), and so on, until the innermost part, which is just 1 + 3. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write down the structure to visualize it better:\n\n- The innermost part is (1 + 3).\n- Then, moving outward, it's (1 + 3*(result of the innermost part)).\n- Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result of the previous layer)), and so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me check the expression again. The problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1+3). Then, moving outward, each layer is (1 + 3*(next layer)). Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving left, it's (1+3*(innermost))\n3. Then, (1 + 3*(previous result))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of times this happens. Let me see how many opening parentheses there are after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Wait, let me count:\n\n- The first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- Then, inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times \"1+3\" is used. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, so starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let's count how many times we have \"1 + 3(...)\":\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(innermost))\n- Then, (1 + 3*(previous))\n- And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count how many layers there are. Let me see: from the innermost to the outermost, each time we have a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen Layer 2 is (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3 is (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4 is (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5 is (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6 is (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7 is (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8 is (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9 is (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recast this as a loop, perhaps, where each step is computed correctly.\n\nLet me list each layer with its corresponding value:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check each layer again, because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, because each time it's a new (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( is a new layer. Let me count how many ( there are after the initial 3:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is the start of the first innermost expression: 1+3(...), which is Layer 1.\n- Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\nFrom the start, after 3, each occurrence of \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each time we have \"1+3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nLet me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs:\n\n- After the initial 3, first \"1+3(\" starts the first layer.\n- Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" for the next layer.\n- Continuing until the end.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a string and count the number of \"1+3(\" substrings.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3( ... starts with the first \"1+3(\" at position 2.\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" at position 6.\n3. Then another at position 10.\n4. Then at position 14.\n5. Then at position 18.\n6. Then at position 22.\n7. Then at position 26.\n8. Then at position 30.\n9. Then at position 34.\n10. Then at position 38.\n\nWait, but the innermost part is (1+3), which doesn't have another \"1+3(\" inside it. So, the number of layers is one less than the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer, except the innermost which is just (1+3).\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach was correct, with 9 layers, but let me verify.\n\nWait, in the expression, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another \"1+3(\" until the 9th layer, which is the outermost. So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the number of layers again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we have a \"1+3(...)\", that's a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is Layer 1.\n- Then, each subsequent ( adds a new layer.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. After 3, first ( is at position 2: Layer 1\n2. Then, another ( at position 6: Layer 2\n3. Then, another at position 10: Layer 3\n4. Then, at 14: Layer 4\n5. At 18: Layer 5\n6. At 22: Layer 6\n7. At 26: Layer 7\n8. At 30: Layer 8\n9. At 34: Layer 9\n10. At 38: Layer 10\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3, the number of ( is 9, because the innermost is (1+3), which doesn't have another ( after that.\n\nWait, let me check the exact structure.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( is a new layer. Let's count how many ( there are after the initial 3:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is Layer 1\n- Then, each subsequent ( adds a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, the number of ( is 9, because the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 9 ( opening parentheses. Therefore, the number of layers is 9, meaning that the innermost is Layer 9, and the outermost is Layer 1.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier counting. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify: if there are 9 ( after the initial 3, that means there are 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but in that case, the innermost would be Layer 9, and each layer moving outward would be 8, 7, etc., up to Layer 1 as the outermost.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because each ( after the initial 3 adds a new layer, and the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1, then each ( adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1, and each subsequent ( adds another layer, so the total number of layers is equal to the number of ( after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nAfter the initial 3, the number of ( is 9, so that would imply 9 layers, each being (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so with 9 layers, the outermost would be Layer 9, which is then multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in that case, the computation would be:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8, but I think that's not the case because each ( after the initial 3 adds a new layer, and there are 9 such (.\n\nWait, let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( is at positions 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38. That's a total of 9 ( after the initial 3, so 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the computation up to Layer 9 is correct, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward.
