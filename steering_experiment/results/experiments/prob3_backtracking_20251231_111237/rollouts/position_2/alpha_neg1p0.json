    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let's see. It's a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to follow a pattern. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. I'll write each layer separately so I can see what's going on.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is 1+3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from above). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the structure again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(1+3). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from previous step), and so on, until we've gone through all the layers.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, so let's count them.\n\nStarting from the left, after the initial 3(, there are nine layers of (1+3(...))).\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and that's repeated multiple times. Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nStarting from the first 1+3, that's the innermost. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first one. Hmm, actually, each 1+3 is inside another set of parentheses, so each layer is another 1+3*(...).\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3 * [1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3))))))))))]\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm not skipping any layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me write down each step with the corresponding layer.\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing all the layers up to Layer 9, the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, in the original problem, how many layers are there?\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nCounting the number of times 1+3(...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first one.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to note that the expression is 3 multiplied by a sum that has nine layers of 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...).\n\nLet me check the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n\n2. Next: 1+3*(1+3)\n\n3. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until there are nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" there are after the initial 3(.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then 1+3(, then another 1+3(, etc.\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there are nine instances of 1+3(, each adding a layer. So, that would be 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I did the computation earlier, I had 9 layers, computing from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I started with Layer 1 as 1+3=4, then Layer 2 as 1+3*4=13, and so on up to Layer 9 as 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm that each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be expressed as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo,\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\n= (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I obtained earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is indeed 29524.\n\nThus, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nTotal expression = 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 59049 * 3 = 177147\n\nSo, Total expression = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms the result again.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation with the closed-form formula, or compute directly, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form formula to compute the result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this. Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is \"1+3\". Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nAlright, so the innermost parentheses simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is \"1 + 3(4)\". Wait, let me make sure. The structure is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). \n\nSo, the next step is to compute 1 + 3*(4). Let me calculate that:\n\n3*(4) = 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(result from previous step). So, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*(13) = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, so now that layer is 40. Let me keep track of each step so I don't get lost. So far, we've gone from the innermost parentheses to the third layer, which is 40. Now, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*(40).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*(40) = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, that layer is 121. Moving out another layer, same structure: 1 + 3*(121).\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n3*(121) = 363\n\n1 + 363 = 364.\n\nOkay, now we're at 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364).\n\nCalculating:\n\n3*(364) = 1,092\n\n1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nSo, that's 1,093. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(1,093).\n\nLet me compute 3*(1,093). Hmm, 1,000*3 is 3,000, and 93*3 is 279, so total is 3,000 + 279 = 3,279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nAlright, so now that layer is 3,280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3,280).\n\nCalculating 3*(3,280): 3,000*3 is 9,000 and 280*3 is 840, so total is 9,000 + 840 = 9,840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nSo, that's 9,841. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(9,841).\n\nCalculating 3*(9,841): Let's see, 9,000*3 is 27,000 and 841*3 is 2,523. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nSo, that's 29,524. Now, moving out to the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(29,524).\n\nCalculating 3*(29,524): 20,000*3 is 60,000, 9,000*3 is 27,000, 500*3 is 1,500, and 24*3 is 72. Adding all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nThen, 1 + 88,572 = 88,573.\n\nAlright, so now we're at 88,573. The next layer out is 1 + 3*(88,573).\n\nCalculating 3*(88,573): Let's break it down. 80,000*3 is 240,000; 8,000*3 is 24,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 70*3 is 210; and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719.\n\nThen, 1 + 265,719 = 265,720.\n\nSo, that layer simplifies to 265,720. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*(265,720).\n\nCalculating 3*(265,720): Let's do 200,000*3 = 600,000; 60,000*3 = 180,000; 5,000*3 = 15,000; 700*3 = 2,100; 20*3 = 60.\n\nAdding those together:\n\n600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000\n\n780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000\n\n795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100\n\n797,100 + 60 = 797,160.\n\nThen, 1 + 797,160 = 797,161.\n\nSo, that layer is 797,161. Now, finally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result.\n\nSo, 3*(797,161). Let's compute that.\n\nBreaking it down: 700,000*3 = 2,100,000; 90,000*3 = 270,000; 7,000*3 = 21,000; 100*3 = 300; 60*3 = 180; 1*3 = 3.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483.\n\nSo, 3*(797,161) = 2,391,483.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2,391,483.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's easy to get lost with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3=4\n\nThen, 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nNext, 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nThen, 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\n1+3*121=1+363=364\n\n1+3*364=1+1,092=1,093\n\n1+3*1,093=1+3,279=3,280\n\n1+3*3,280=1+9,840=9,841\n\n1+3*9,841=1+29,523=29,524\n\n1+3*29,524=1+88,572=88,573\n\n1+3*88,573=1+265,719=265,720\n\n1+3*265,720=1+797,160=797,161\n\nFinally, 3*797,161=2,391,483\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and I don't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, nested expressions like this can be represented as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That seems like a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but each term is added by 1 before multiplying.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the depth from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers of 1+3(...).\n\nWait, actually, let's count how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Wait, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...), and we have 9 such layers before the outermost 3(...). So, perhaps it's 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections:\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, actually, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the 9th layer, which is 1+3(...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nIf that's the case, then the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2*C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9, since there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't match my earlier computation where a_9 was 797,161. That can't be right. There must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the recurrence, n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which was 4. But in the problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, perhaps the index is off.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The innermost layer is 1+3=4, which we called a_1=4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, for the problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3, meaning n=9.\n\nBut according to the closed-form, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524, but when I computed step by step earlier, the 9th layer was 797,161. That's a discrepancy. So, clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the indexing is different. Maybe n=0 corresponds to the innermost layer. Let me check.\n\nIf n=0, then a_0 = 1 + 3*a_{-1}, but that's not helpful. Maybe I misapplied the initial condition.\n\nWait, let's see. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and when n=1, a_1=4. So, plugging n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Also matches.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2,187 -1)/2=2,186/2=1,093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6,561 -1)/2=6,560/2=3,280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19,683 -1)/2=19,682/2=9,841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Wait, but in my step-by-step earlier, when I reached the 9th layer, it was 797,161. That can't be. There's a confusion here.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th layer. But according to the recurrence, a_9=29,524, which is different from what I computed earlier.\n\nWait, I think the confusion is arising because in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is as per the recurrence.\n\nBut when I computed step-by-step earlier, I went beyond that because I was computing each layer up to the outermost 3*(...). Let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, up to a_9=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with my earlier step-by-step where I computed up to 797,161 and then multiplied by 3 to get 2,391,483.\n\nSo, clearly, I have a misunderstanding here. Let me try to recount the layers.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is 1 + 3*(layer8).\n\nThus, according to the recurrence, layer1=4, layer2=13, layer3=40,... up to layer9=29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nBut this contradicts my earlier step-by-step computation where I ended up with 2,391,483.\n\nSo, I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let's recount the layers in the original problem.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it with indices to see the layers:\n\nLayer1: 1+3\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer4: 1+3*(Layer3)\n\nLayer5: 1+3*(Layer4)\n\nLayer6: 1+3*(Layer5)\n\nLayer7: 1+3*(Layer6)\n\nLayer8: 1+3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, according to this, the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to Layer9 as 797,161, then multiplied by 3 to get 2,391,483. But according to the recurrence, Layer9 is 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses: starting after the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3( ... )) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first \"(\" after 3 is for Layer1: 1+3(...)\n\n- Then, each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\":\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, so there are 9 \"(\" after the initial 3, which would imply 9 layers? But in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer1, then each \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1+3(\" sections, it's 9. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, meaning Layer9 is the innermost?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. The innermost is the first one, so Layer1 is the innermost, and Layer9 is the outermost.\n\nBut according to the expression, the innermost is the last one, which is 1+3, and each preceding is a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the expression from the inside out.\n\nLet me write the expression step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost: 1+3=4\n\nThen, moving out, the next is 1+3*(4)=13\n\nThen, next is 1+3*(13)=40\n\nThen, 1+3*(40)=121\n\n1+3*(121)=364\n\n1+3*(364)=1,093\n\n1+3*(1,093)=3,280\n\n1+3*(3,280)=9,841\n\n1+3*(9,841)=29,524\n\n1+3*(29,524)=88,573\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, starting from 1+3=4 (Layer1), up to Layer9=88,573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*88,573=265,719.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to Layer9=797,161, which was incorrect.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me try to recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6: 1+3*364=1,093\n\nLayer7: 1+3*1,093=3,280\n\nLayer8: 1+3*3,280=9,841\n\nLayer9: 1+3*9,841=29,524\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, Layer9=29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier computation where I had Layer9=797,161. So, I think the confusion is arising from how I'm counting the layers.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me parse it correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1+3*(1+3).\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)).\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sections.\n\nEach \"(\" after the initial 3 corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", which is 1+3(...), that's Layer1.\n\nThen, each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. ...1+3(...\n\n3. ...1+3(...\n\n4. ...1+3(...\n\n5. ...1+3(...\n\n6. ...1+3(...\n\n7. ...1+3(...\n\n8. ...1+3(...\n\n9. ...1+3(...\n\n10. ...1+3))\n\nWait, so there are 9 \"1+3(\" sections, meaning 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nTherefore, the innermost is Layer1=1+3=4.\n\nThen, Layer2=1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3=1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4=1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5=1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6=1+3*364=1,093\n\nLayer7=1+3*1,093=3,280\n\nLayer8=1+3*3,280=9,841\n\nLayer9=1+3*9,841=29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had Layer9=797,161, which is incorrect because I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)=1+12=13\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)=1+39=40\n\nLayer4: 1+3*(Layer3)=1+120=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*(Layer4)=1+363=364\n\nLayer6: 1+3*(Layer5)=1+1,092=1,093\n\nLayer7: 1+3*(Layer6)=1+3,279=3,280\n\nLayer8: 1+3*(Layer7)=1+9,840=9,841\n\nLayer9: 1+3*(Layer8)=1+29,523=29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond 9 layers because I miscounted the number of layers in the original expression. I thought there were more layers, but actually, it's 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 2,391,483, which is way larger. So, I need to resolve this discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how the layers are counted. Let me write the expression with indices:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer1: 1+3\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nLayer9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, according to this, Layer9 is 1+3*(Layer8), and the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nTherefore, Layer1=4\n\nLayer2=13\n\nLayer3=40\n\nLayer4=121\n\nLayer5=364\n\nLayer6=1,093\n\nLayer7=3,280\n\nLayer8=9,841\n\nLayer9=29,524\n\nEntire expression=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step-by-step, I went beyond Layer9 because I thought the outermost expression was another layer. But actually, the outermost is just 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(previous layer), and there are 9 such layers before the outermost 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is 88,572.\n\nBut now I'm confused because my initial step-by-step went beyond that, leading to a much larger number. So, I need to figure out where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1+3*(...). So, let's see:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)=1+12=13\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)=1+39=40\n\nLayer4: 1+3*(Layer3)=1+120=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*(Layer4)=1+363=364\n\nLayer6: 1+3*(Layer5)=1+1,092=1,093\n\nLayer7: 1+3*(Layer6)=1+3,279=3,280\n\nLayer8: 1+3*(Layer7)=1+9,840=9,841\n\nLayer9: 1+3*(Layer8)=1+29,523=29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, my initial mistake was thinking there were more layers beyond Layer9, but in reality, the outermost expression is just 3*(Layer9), not another layer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 2,391,483, which is 3*(Layer12), perhaps? Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers when I was computing step-by-step. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from Layer1=4\n\nLayer2=13\n\nLayer3=40\n\nLayer4=121\n\nLayer5=364\n\nLayer6=1,093\n\nLayer7=3,280\n\nLayer8=9,841\n\nLayer9=29,524\n\nLayer10=88,573\n\nLayer11=265,720\n\nLayer12=797,161\n\nLayer13=2,391,483\n\nWait, so in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. It seems like there's a lot of nested parentheses here, so I should probably start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with these kinds of expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, so each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a sum of 1 and another similar expression. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd this goes on until Layer 9, I think. Because each time it's another set of parentheses, so there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me confirm that.\n\nLooking at the original expression, I see nine sets of parentheses: each (1+3(...)) is a layer, so yes, 9 layers in total. So I'll compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9 for clarity.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, moving to L2:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, 3*4 is 12, so L2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to L3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so L3 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, okay. L4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so L4 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so L5 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364, let me calculate that. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. So L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Thus, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, hold on, 3*1093: Let me double-check that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Yes, that's correct. So L7=3280.\n\nL8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Therefore, L8=1 + 9840=9841\n\nL9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nHmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding those up: 27000+2400=29400, plus 123 is 29523. So L9=1 + 29523=29524\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I did that multiplication correctly. 3*9841: 9841*3. Let's break it down:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nNow, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Yes, that's correct. So L9=29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So the final step is to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that. 29524*3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication another way. Maybe 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*       3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. It's easy to miscalculate when there are so many layers.\n\nStarting with L1=4, correct.\n\nL2=1 + 3*4=13, correct.\n\nL3=1 + 3*13=40, correct.\n\nL4=1 + 3*40=121, correct.\n\nL5=1 + 3*121=364, correct.\n\nL6=1 + 3*364=1093, correct.\n\nL7=1 + 3*1093=3280, correct.\n\nL8=1 + 3*3280=9841, correct.\n\nL9=1 + 3*9841=29524, correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572, correct.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems right. Each layer builds upon the previous one, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's almost like a geometric series, but each term is built recursively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined by L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r=3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApply the initial condition L(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems interesting. So L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nYes, so this formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have L9, which is n=9. So L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, then also found a closed-form formula to confirm the result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_i \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost expression. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, the key is to start from the innermost parentheses and work your way outwards. So, I should probably start by evaluating the innermost part first and then move outward. \n\nLet me rewrite the expression to better visualize it:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, okay. So each time, there's a \"1 + 3(...)\" part, and each of those is multiplied by 3. It seems like a repeating pattern, maybe a recursive structure? But I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet's start by labeling each layer for clarity. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1). Let's compute that.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out is again 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Got it.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That's a big number, but okay.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3*1093. Let me compute that again: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Okay.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from Layer 9). Let's compute that.\n\nLayer 10: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3. \n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\nThen, 9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Maybe I can compute the layers again in reverse, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but I think I did each step correctly. Let me check a couple of layers to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nLayer 10: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it might be a bit more involved. Let me see if that approach could work.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check if that works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer k, the value is (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total? Wait, let me count.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of layers.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) -> layer 1\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(layer1) -> layer2\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(layer2) -> layer3\n\nContinuing until the outermost layer, which is layer9, because each time we add another layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that would imply 9 layers. So, layer1 is the innermost, and layer9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, using our formula, layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, layer9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. But I think the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation approach both work well here.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify the final multiplication: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Since each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's similar to a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant each time. However, the recurrence relation method seems more straightforward here.\n\nIn summary, by systematically evaluating each nested layer from the inside out, and verifying each step, I arrived at the solution. It's a good reminder of how important it is to carefully compute each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nesting, to avoid errors.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the innermost layer (layer 1), we compute each subsequent layer up to layer 9, then multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n10. **Final Layer:** \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on...\n\nWait, actually, each time we're adding another 1 + 3(...) layer. Let me count how many times this happens. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the original expression, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...).

Let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers.

Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times 1 + 3 appears inside the parentheses.\n\nWait, each time we have a 1 + 3 followed by a parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen each layer wraps around it:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time adding another 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of layer 9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check the multiplication again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nBut wait a second, that feels too big. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer individually. Maybe there's a geometric series or something.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, so a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40,\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121,\n\nand so on.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a linear recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, the value after 9 layers is a_9 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by a_9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the inside out:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing all layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested expressions. Let me see... It's a series of 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by another similar expression), and this goes on several times. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, so let me count how many layers there are. Each time, it's 3 times something, so let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1+3. Then that result is inside another 1+3(...), and this repeats. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n- Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n- And this continues until the innermost part is 1+3.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the expression, the innermost part is 1+3, and then each layer wraps that with another 1+3*(something). Let me try to parse this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write it out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121).\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364).\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093).\n\n3*1093: Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280).\n\n3*3280: Let's see, 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841).\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524).\n\n3*29524: Let me compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72.\n\nNow add those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nThen 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I count the layers, I think I might have miscounted how many times I need to do this. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 = 4\n\n2. 1+3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1+3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1+3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1+3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1+3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1+3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1+3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1+3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. 1+3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but then after that, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by that result, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing the innermost, we have 10 layers of 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, let me recount. Let's see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So starting from the innermost, each step is a layer. Let me count how many times I did the 1 + 3*... steps.\n\nI think I did it 9 times, leading up to 88573, and then the outermost 3*(88573) would be the final step. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure it differently. Let me try to outline each step with the correct nesting.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define each step as E1, E2, E3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9: 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nE10: 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(E10). So that would be 3*88573.\n\nWait, let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. Wait, actually, when I count the number of 3*(...) layers, it's from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expression is 3*(E10), where E10 is 1 + 3*(E9), and so on down to E1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, if I have E1 through E10, then the entire expression is 3*E10.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to E10 being 88573, so then the final result would be 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that: 88573 * 3.\n\nCompute 80000*3 = 240000\n\n8000*3=24000 \u2192 Wait, no, 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute digit by digit:\n\n88573 * 3:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21 \u2192 write down 1, carry over 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 2\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26 \u2192 write down 6, carry over 2\n\nWait, no, wait: 88573 is 8 (ten thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 3 (units).\n\nWait, actually, let me write it out properly:\n\n88573\n\n\u00d7        3\n\n------------\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9 \u2192 units place\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21 \u2192 tens place: write 1, carry over 2\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 hundreds place: write 7, carry over 1\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 thousands place: write 5, carry over 2\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26 \u2192 ten thousands place: write 6, carry over 2\n\nWait, but that leaves a carry over of 2, which we need to add as a new digit on the left.\n\nWait, but 88573 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9 \u2192 units digit.\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21 \u2192 tens digit: 1, carryover 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 hundreds digit: 7, carryover 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 thousands digit: 5, carryover 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26 \u2192 ten thousands digit: 6, carryover 2.\n\nSince we're at the highest digit, we add the carryover as a new digit: 2.\n\nSo, the result is 265719.\n\nWait, let me confirm that:\n\n88573 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n80000 \u00d7 3 = 240000\n\n8000 \u00d7 3 = 24000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n70 \u00d7 3 = 210\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 \u00d7 88573 = 265719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E10. Let me go through each step again to confirm.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nE10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nYes, that seems correct. So E10 is indeed 88573, and 3*E10 is 265719.\n\nWait a second, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1+3(...) is a layer.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression inside is (1 + 3*(...)), which itself contains another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times (1+3(...) appears:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n3. And this continues until the innermost part, which is (1+3).\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, how many layers are there?\n\nEach opening ( corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. The first ( after the first 3.\n\nThen each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n10. (1 + 3)\n\nWait, so that's 10 opening parentheses after the first 3, meaning there are 10 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), each nested within the previous one. So that would mean E1 through E10, as I computed earlier, and then the final result is 3*E10.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier computation, I had E1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent E is the next layer out. So E10 would be the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), and then the entire expression is 3*(E10).\n\nTherefore, my computation seems correct, leading to 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute E10 again step by step.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nE10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*88573 is indeed 265719.\n\nWait, but let me just check one more time, perhaps using a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: E_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say E_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nE_p = 1 + 3*E_p\n\nSolving for E_p:\n\nE_p - 3*E_p = 1\n\n-2*E_p = 1\n\nE_p = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nE_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works for n=1.\n\nE_1 should be 4.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, E_2 should be 13.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nE_3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nE_4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nE_5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nE_6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE_7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE_8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE_9: (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nE_10: (3^11 - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds for each step. Therefore, E_10 is indeed 88573, and the entire expression is 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nThus, the final answer is 265719.\n\nWait, just to make sure, perhaps I can compute 3*(3^{11} - 1)/2.\n\nSince E_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2, then 3*E_10 = 3*(3^{11} - 1)/2 = (3^{12} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{12}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147, 3^12=531441.\n\nSo, 3^{12} = 531441.\n\nThus, (531441 - 3)/2 = 531438/2 = 265719.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 265719.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n10. \\( E_{10} = 1 + 3 \\times E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 88573 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times E_{10} \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 88573 = 265719 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{265719}\n\\]"

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is \\(1 + 3\\). Let me compute that first. \n\n\\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\nAlright, so now, moving one level out, we have another expression: \\(1 + 3(\\text{something})\\). The something here is the result we just got, which is 4. So, substituting that in, it becomes \\(1 + 3 \\times 4\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The structure is \\(3(1 + 3(...))\\), so each time, the inner part is \\(1 + 3(\\text{inner result})\\). So, each step involves computing \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous result}\\), and then multiplying that by 3.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this by working from the inside out, computing each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer out: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4\\). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13\\). 3 times 13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40\\). 3 times 40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121\\). 3 times 121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364\\). 3 times 364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093\\). 3 times 1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280\\). 3 times 3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841\\). 3 times 9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: \\(3 \\times 29524\\). Let me compute that.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. I'll go through each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Correct.\n2. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\). Correct.\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\). Correct.\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\). Correct.\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\). Correct.\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\). Correct.\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\). Correct.\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\). Correct.\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\). Correct.\n10. Finally: \\(3 \\times 29524\\). Let me compute that.\n\nNow, 3 times 29524. Let me break this down:\n\n3 times 20000 is 60000.\n\n3 times 9000 is 27000.\n\n3 times 500 is 1500.\n\n3 times 20 is 60.\n\n3 times 4 is 12.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So adding up each part:\n\n60000 (from 20000)  \n+27000 (from 9000) = 87000  \n+1500 (from 500) = 88500  \n+60 (from 20) = 88560  \n+12 (from 4) = 88572.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 3 times 29524 is actually 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct because 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7      3  \n---------  \n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n10. \\(3\u00d729524 = 88572\\)\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, so I don't have to compute each step manually. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested \\(1 + 3(\\text{something})\\), multiplied by 3 each time. So, each layer is \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer})\\). \n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of layers. The innermost layer is \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is \\(a_{n} = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\).\n\nWait, but in the problem, each layer is multiplied by 3 at the end. Wait, no, actually, each time, the expression is \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (...)))\\). So, each layer is \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer})\\).\n\nWait, so maybe each step is \\(a_n = 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1})\\).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Then, moving out, the next layer is \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 4)\\), which is \\(3 \\times 13 = 39\\). Wait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to 29524 before multiplying by 3. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should index the layers correctly. Let me think again.\n\nThe innermost expression is \\(1 + 3\\), which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\). Then, the next layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\), and so on, up to 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\), and then the whole thing is multiplied by 3. So, actually, the number of times we apply the \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) operation is 9 times, starting from 1, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the expression can be represented as \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times \\dots \\times (1 + 3) \\dots )))\\), with 9 instances of \\(1 + 3\\).\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I computed 9 layers inside and then multiplied by 3, resulting in 88,572. But let me see if I can find a formula for this.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\), starting with \\(a_1 = 1\\). Wait, no, actually, in the innermost layer, it's \\(1 + 3 = 4\\), so perhaps \\(a_1 = 4\\), and then each subsequent \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\).\n\nWait, let me test that:\n\nIf \\(a_1 = 4\\),\n\\(a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\),\n\\(a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\),\n\\(a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\),\nand so on, up to \\(a_9\\), which would be the innermost part before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I had 9 layers, each time computing \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous result, starting from 1 + 3, and then the final result was \\(3 \\times a_9\\). So, perhaps the formula for \\(a_n\\) is \\(a_n = 1 + 3 a_{n-1}\\), with \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\nAlternatively, since each step is \\(a_n = 1 + 3 a_{n-1}\\), we can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\n\\(a_n = A \\times 3^n + B\\),\n\nwhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence:\n\n\\(a_n = 1 + 3 a_{n-1}\\).\n\nAssume solution \\(a_n = A \\times 3^n + B\\).\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\n\\(A \\times 3^n + B = 1 + 3(A \\times 3^{n-1} + B)\\).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\(1 + 3A \\times 3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A \\times 3^n + 3B\\).\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\n\\(A \\times 3^n + B = 1 + A \\times 3^n + 3B\\).\n\nSubtract \\(A \\times 3^n\\) from both sides:\n\n\\(B = 1 + 3B\\).\n\nSolving for B:\n\n\\(B - 3B = 1\\),\n\\(-2B = 1\\),\n\\(B = -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the general solution is \\(a_n = A \\times 3^n - \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\(4 = A \\times 3^1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\),\n\\(4 = 3A - \\frac{1}{2}\\),\nAdding \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to both sides:\n\n\\(4 + \\frac{1}{2} = 3A\\),\n\\(\\frac{9}{2} = 3A\\),\nSo, \\(A = \\frac{9}{2} \\div 3 = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution is \\(a_n = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 3^n - \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nAlternatively, \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\n\\(a_1 = \\frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = \\frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4\\). Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\n\\(a_2 = \\frac{3^3 - 1}{2} = \\frac{27 - 1}{2} = 13\\). Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\n\\(a_3 = \\frac{3^4 - 1}{2} = \\frac{81 - 1}{2} = 40\\). Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\n\\(a_4 = \\frac{3^5 - 1}{2} = \\frac{243 - 1}{2} = 121\\). Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers of \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) operations, so n=9. Therefore, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}\\).\n\nCompute \\(3^{10}\\):\n\n3^1 = 3  \n3^2 = 9  \n3^3 = 27  \n3^4 = 81  \n3^5 = 243  \n3^6 = 729  \n3^7 = 2187  \n3^8 = 6561  \n3^9 = 19683  \n3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, \\(a_9 = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\frac{59048}{2} = 29524\\).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times this, so:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression can be represented as 3 \u00d7 a_9 = 3 \u00d7 ( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049  \n3^11 = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each step manually or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by computing the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each part of the expression is similar, so maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way up. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one has the form 1 + 3(something). So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and moving outward, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me number these layers for clarity. The innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, and so on up to layer 9, with the outermost being layer 9. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3), layer 2 is 1 + 3*(result of layer 1), and so on.\n\nLet me write this out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original problem, it's 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8).\n\nHmm, so maybe I should compute each layer starting from the inside and moving outwards, keeping track of each result as I go.\n\nLet me start with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 2 uses Layer 1's result:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nLet me compute 3*13 first: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then add 1: 39 + 1 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me confirm: 3*13 is indeed 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, moving on.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 3*4=12, so 3*40=120. Then add 1: 120 + 1 = 121. So Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: Let's see, 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then add 1: 363 + 1 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364.\n\nWait, that seems like a big jump, but let's go on.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding these up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when breaking numbers down, it's easy to miscount.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n---------\nLet's compute digit by digit from right to left:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17. Wait, but wait, the digits are 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). Wait, maybe I misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, we get 88572. That matches my earlier calculation, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought 9 \u00d7 3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, so I write 8 and carry 2. Then 2 \u00d7 3 is 6 plus 2 is 8. So yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the total expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just go through all the layers again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems like all the steps check out. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might have saved me some time. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is following the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which might help compute it without going through each step. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable as is, but perhaps it's an interesting observation.\n\nThe recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. But since I was computing each layer step by step, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form approach corroborates the step-by-step method.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Starting from the innermost part, it seems like each layer adds another 1+3, and then multiplies by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nLooking at it, I can see that starting from the innermost part, there are nine sets of parentheses. So, maybe I should start solving it from the inside out. That makes sense because in math problems with nested parentheses, you always work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. The very last part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 equals 4. That seems straightforward. Now, the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, maybe it's better to represent it as a recursive formula or something. Let me try to see the pattern here.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term. Let's say the innermost is term 1, then each subsequent term is built by adding another 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from term 1:\n\nTerm 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nTerm 2: 1 + 3*(Term 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nTerm 3: 1 + 3*(Term 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nTerm 4: 1 + 3*(Term 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nTerm 5: 1 + 3*(Term 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nTerm 6: 1 + 3*(Term 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nTerm 7: 1 + 3*(Term 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nTerm 8: 1 + 3*(Term 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nTerm 9: 1 + 3*(Term 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Term 9, which is the innermost part, we have to multiply it by 3, right?\n\nWait, no, actually, let me double-check. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, actually, Term 1 is 4, Term 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Term 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to Term 9, which would be 29524, as I calculated above.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(Term 9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, I think I need to compute 3*(Term 9).\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then moving outward, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, Term 1 is 4, Term 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Term 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, Term 4 is 1 + 3*40 = 121, Term 5 is 1 + 3*121 = 364, Term 6 is 1 + 3*364 = 1093, Term 7 is 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, Term 8 is 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, Term 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, the innermost is Term 1: 4, and each subsequent Term is built by 1 + 3*Term(n-1). So, Term 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Term 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, each layer is built upon the previous. So, yes, Term 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Term 9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute 3*29524. Let's do that multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nCompute 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nCompute 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nCompute 20 * 3 = 60\n\nCompute 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that's a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n= 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that also works.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I correctly identified the number of terms. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nFrom the inside:\n\n(1+3) is the first.\n\nThen, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is the first, then each subsequent is another layer. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside it is 1 + 3*(...). The innermost is (1+3), and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let's count the number of layers.\n\nFrom the innermost, each time we have a new (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1)\n\nLayer3:1 + 3*(layer2)\n\nAnd so on, until layer9:1 + 3*(layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(previous), and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, yes, that would be 9 layers, so term9 is 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write out the layers step by step.\n\nLet me represent each layer as follows:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I calculated earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, we get 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). \n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nAlright, let's see. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\nSo, (1 + 3) equals 4. Okay, so I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, let me look again.\n\nWait, the structure is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next inner expression). So, maybe I should work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write this down as layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, I think. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost (1+3), each time we go out, we add another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. Continuing this way until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me count how many times this happens. Let me see the original expression again:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) parts. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working out. Let me try to number each layer from the inside out.\n\nSo, let's start:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, but in the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I can define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., up to L9, since there are 9 layers of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me check the number of layers. Let's see the original expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, the next is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3.\n\nAnd so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which would be Layer 9, since each time we have another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...) appears. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is a layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), but let me check.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...), so that's Layer 2, Layer 3, etc.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a 3 followed by a (1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\nThe first 3( is followed by 1 + 3(...), then that 3 is followed by another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have 3(1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 3(1 + 3(...)), so let's see how many times that occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but I'm not sure. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, that would be 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in my earlier computation, Layer 9 was 29524, so then the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm how many layers there are. Let's see, the innermost is (1+3), then each time we add another layer until we reach the outermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, we have 1+3(...), then each time another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then the total expression would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me try to count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer 3) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer 4) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer 5) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer 6) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer 7) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer 8) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then 3*29524 would be the total.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n3*4 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n3*2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n3*5 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n3*9 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n3*2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier layers again because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times I have 3*(...) in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)):\n\n- The first 3( is followed by 1 + 3(...), which is Layer 2.\n\nThen, inside that, another 3( is followed by 1 + 3(...), which is Layer 3.\n\nThis continues until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers, but let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) instances.\n\nWait, the original expression has 8 opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...)), but each time we have a 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each time, we have a 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the innermost, we have 9 such layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers, with Layer 9 being 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nBut let me check the number of layers again to make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nLet me write out the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I have 9 layers. Let me count the number of times I have a 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)):\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\n2. Then, moving out, 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) \u2192 Layer 2.\n\n3. Then, 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) \u2192 Layer 3.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we add a layer by multiplying 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I computed before, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 88,572 seems like a large number, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1, it does grow exponentially.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nWait, this seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me think: each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, L(1) = 4\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b is L(n) = a^n * L(0) + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), but in our case, it's L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nWait, let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check with n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula.\n\nWait, since the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ) = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^11 is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572 \u2192 same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...).\n\n- Each layer can be computed step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\n- Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\n- For n=9, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\n- The entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by computing each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find the value of the outermost layer and multiply it by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

It seems like a nested expression where each layer has 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). So, starting from the innermost part, each time it's 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. So, maybe I can compute this from the inside out.\n\nLet me write down the expression more clearly, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let's number each layer for clarity. There are nine layers of parentheses, so I'll label them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9.\n\nSo, starting with Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, no, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), but let me check:\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nSo, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again, maybe writing each step more carefully.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 So, 20000 + 9000 = 29000, 29000 * 3 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the number is 88572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.\n\nWait, Layer 8 was 9841. So, 3*9841 = 29523, then 29523 + 1 = 29524. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer again to check for any possible miscalculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem was correctly interpreted. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of layers: starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, I think. Because each time you go one layer out, you add another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so let's count the number of times we see \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time adding another (1 + 3(...)), so Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and Layer 9 is the outermost. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct, with 9 layers, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each step seems to follow logically from the previous one, and I've checked each layer's computation. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3 multiplied by something. Each \"something\" is 1 plus another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of these 3 times (1 + ...) terms. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me identify the innermost part first.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, it's 1 + 3*(innermost result). Let me check.\n\nWait, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost part). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. So, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so that simplifies the next part to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so that's 40. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, moving on.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nHmm, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that.\n\n3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nWait, 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1092 +1=1093.\n\nOkay, so that's 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute that.\n\n3*1093: Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 +1=3280.\n\nWait, 3*1093 is 3279, right? Because 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nAlright, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 3280 times 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840, plus 1=9841. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that.\n\n3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. That seems right.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Hmm, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding those up: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500=88500, plus 60=88560, plus 12=88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nWait, let me make sure. 3*29524: 29524 *3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, 88572. Then, 88572 +1=88573. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute that.\n\n3*88573: Let me break it down. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000+24000=264000, plus 1500=265500, plus 210=265710, plus 9=265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720.\n\nWait, let me check the multiplication again. 88573 *3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000+24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. Then, 265719 +1=265720. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute that.\n\n3*265720: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000+180000=780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161.\n\nWait, let me verify with another method. 265720 *3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000 = 780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160. Then, 797160 +1=797161. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*797161. Let me compute that.\n\n3*797161: Let me break it down. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, +21000=2391000, +300=2391300, +180=2391480, +3=2391483. Then, adding 1 gives 2391484.\n\nWait, let me check the multiplication again. 797161 *3: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, 2100000 +270000=2370000, +21000=2391000, +300=2391300, +180=2391480, +3=2391483. Then, 2391483 +1=2391484. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*2391484. Let me compute that.\n\n3*2391484: Let me break it down. 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. So, adding up: 6000000 +900000=6900000, +270000=7170000, +3000=7173000, +1200=7174200, +240=7174440, +12=7174452. Then, adding 1 gives 7174453.\n\nWait, let me verify step by step. 2391484 *3:\n\nFirst, 2,000,000 *3=6,000,000\n\n300,000 *3=900,000\n\n90,000 *3=270,000\n\n1,000 *3=3,000\n\n400 *3=1,200\n\n80 *3=240\n\n4 *3=12\n\nSo, adding up: 6,000,000 +900,000=6,900,000\n\n6,900,000 +270,000=7,170,000\n\n7,170,000 +3,000=7,173,000\n\n7,173,000 +1,200=7,174,200\n\n7,174,200 +240=7,174,440\n\n7,174,440 +12=7,174,452\n\nThen, 7,174,452 +1=7,174,453. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the inner part is 7,174,453.\n\nWait, no, actually, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the inner part we just calculated is 7,174,453. So, we have 3*(1 + 7,174,453). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 1 + 7,174,453 = 7,174,454.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 7,174,454 *3.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n7,174,454 *3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n7,000,000 *3=21,000,000\n\n174,000 *3=522,000\n\n454 *3=1,362\n\nWait, but actually, 7,174,454 is 7,000,000 + 174,000 + 454.\n\nSo, 7,000,000*3=21,000,000\n\n174,000*3=522,000\n\n454*3=1,362\n\nAdding them up: 21,000,000 +522,000=21,522,000\n\n21,522,000 +1,362=21,523,362\n\nSo, 7,174,454 *3=21,523,362.\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\n7,174,454 *3:\n\n7,000,000 *3=21,000,000\n\n100,000 *3=300,000 (but 7,174,454 is 7,000,000 + 174,454)\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it digit by digit.\n\n7,174,454\nx          3\n------------\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n5*3=15 +1=16, write down 6, carryover 1\n4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carryover 1\n7*3=21 +1=22, write down 2, carryover 2\n4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carryover 1\n1*3=3 +1=4\n7*3=21\n\nWait, let's do it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 (units place) *3=12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n5 (tens place) *3=15 +1=16. Write 6, carryover 1.\n\n4 (hundreds place) *3=12 +1=13. Write 3, carryover 1.\n\n7 (thousands place) *3=21 +1=22. Write 2, carryover 2.\n\n4 (ten thousands place) *3=12 +2=14. Write 4, carryover 1.\n\n1 (hundred thousands place) *3=3 +1=4. Write 4, no carryover.\n\n7 (millions place) *3=21. Write 21.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right:\n\n2 (units)\n6 (tens)\n3 (hundreds)\n2 (thousands)\n4 (ten thousands)\n4 (hundred thousands)\n21 (millions and ten millions)\n\nWait, but when writing it out, the digits would be:\n\n21,523,362.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe result is 21,523,362.\n\nWait, but when I broke it down earlier, I had 21,000,000 +522,000 +1,362=21,523,362. That matches.\n\nSo, 7,174,454 *3=21,523,362.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 21,523,362.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. It's easy to make an error with such large numbers.\n\nLet me recount the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n2. Next: 1+3*4=13\n3. Next: 1+3*13=40\n4. Next: 1+3*40=121\n5. Next: 1+3*121=364\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1093\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=3280\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=9841\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=29524\n10. Next: 1+3*29524=88573\n11. Next: 1+3*88573=265720\n12. Next: 1+3*265720=797161\n13. Next: 1+3*797161=2391484\n14. Next: 1+3*2391484=7174453\n15. Finally: 3*(1 + 7174453)=3*7174454=21523362\n\nWait, I just realized that when I was computing the outermost layer, I wrote 7,174,454 *3=21,523,362, but the actual computation is 3*(1 + 7,174,453)=3*7,174,454=21,523,362. So, that's correct.\n\nLet me just check the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers of nesting. Let me count the steps:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n2. 1+3*4=13\n3. 1+3*13=40\n4. 1+3*40=121\n5. 1+3*121=364\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n10. 1+3*29524=88573\n11. 1+3*88573=265720\n12. 1+3*265720=797161\n13. 1+3*797161=2391484\n14. 1+3*2391484=7174453\n15. 3*(1+7174453)=21523362\n\nWait, so actually, there are 15 steps here, but the original expression has 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, actually, the number of layers is 9, so the number of steps should be 9. Let me recount, perhaps I added an extra step.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n\n2. Next layer: 1+3*4=13\n\n3. Next: 1+3*13=40\n\n4. Next: 1+3*40=121\n\n5. Next: 1+3*121=364\n\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=29524\n\n10. Next: 1+3*29524=88573\n\n11. Next: 1+3*88573=265720\n\n12. Next: 1+3*265720=797161\n\n13. Next: 1+3*797161=2391484\n\n14. Next: 1+3*2391484=7174453\n\n15. Finally: 3*(1 + 7174453)=21523362\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers, so perhaps I went one step too far. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each \"1+\" is a new layer, and there are 9 such layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3)\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(layer9)\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute layer1: 1+3=4\n\n2. Compute layer2: 1+3*4=13\n\n3. layer3:1+3*13=40\n\n4. layer4:1+3*40=121\n\n5. layer5:1+3*121=364\n\n6. layer6:1+3*364=1093\n\n7. layer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. layer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. layer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, that doesn't match what I had before. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and there are 9 such expressions inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, let me write it as:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, that would mean:\n\nCompute L1 through L9, then multiply L9 by 3.\n\nSo, let's compute step by step:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier steps where I went up to 21 million. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is a new layer, and there are 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\" inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, that would mean L1 to L9 as above, leading to L9=29524, then 3*L9=88572.\n\nBut earlier, I went further, computing up to 21 million, which suggests that I was treating the outermost 3*(...) as another layer, but actually, the outermost is just 3*(L9), so it's only 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+\" terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen each subsequent \"1+\" adds another layer:\n\n2. (1+3(...))\n\n3. (1+3(...))\n\n...\n\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nSo, the innermost is layer1: (1+3)\n\nThen layer2: 1 + 3*(layer1)\n\n...\n\nUp to layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(layer9)\n\nSo, the total layers are 9, and the outermost is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I went up to 21 million, which suggests I was considering more layers than actually present.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+\" appears, excluding the outermost 3*(...):\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a \"3(\", so let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3(...))\n\n3. (1+3(...))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the 9th time.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\" inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the computation should stop at L9=29524, then 3*L9=88572.\n\nBut earlier, I went beyond that, which suggests I was considering more layers than present. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1093\n\nLayer7: 3280\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nLayer9: 29524\n\nThen, outermost: 3*29524=88572\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut earlier, I went up to 21 million, which suggests I added more layers than present. So, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression has more layers. Let me check again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+\" terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen each subsequent \"1+\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1+\" in the entire expression.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer4: 1+3*(Layer3)\n\nLayer5: 1+3*(Layer4)\n\nLayer6: 1+3*(Layer5)\n\nLayer7: 1+3*(Layer6)\n\nLayer8: 1+3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, leading to Layer9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think earlier I miscounted the layers, considering more than 9 layers, which led to the incorrect result of 21,523,362.\n\nSo, to correct this, I should only compute up to Layer9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nLet me confirm this by another approach.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows a pattern. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWe can find A and B using the initial condition.\n\nAt n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B\n\nAlso, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B.\n\nTo find B, we can set up the equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssuming a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = B,\n\nThen B = 1 + 3*B => B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2\n\nWait, but that would give a particular solution of B= -1/2.\n\nThen, the"

It seems like each part is similar, so maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try to visualize this. \n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving outwards, each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the result of the previous parentheses.\n3. There are nine layers here, right? Because each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, and I count nine sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nStarting from the left: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nYes, each time I see a new opening parenthesis after a 3, so that's nine layers. So, I need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one and moving outwards. \n\nLet me try to compute each step one by one. I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. I'll label each step as S1, S2, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\n**Step 1 (S1): Compute the innermost parentheses**\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3). \n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, S1 = 4\n\n**Step 2 (S2): Next layer out**\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + S1). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me make sure I get the structure right.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which was (1 + 3), which is 4. Then the next layer out would be 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, no, actually, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then the next layer is 3*(1 + that result). So:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen S2: 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but wait, actually, no. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, each step is 3*(1 + previous step).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, S1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen S2: 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nThen S3: 3*(1 + S2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's 3*(1 + next layer). So, each step is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, perhaps I should write each step down more carefully.\n\nLet me try to write each step as S1, S2, up to S9, where each S is the result of that layer.\n\nS1: innermost (1 + 3) = 4\n\nS2: 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3: 3*(1 + S2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4: 3*(1 + S3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5: 3*(1 + S4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6: 3*(1 + S5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7: 3*(1 + S6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8: 3*(1 + S7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9: 3*(1 + S8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me check S9 again. 1 + 12027 is 12028, and 3 times that is indeed 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each step is 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from 4, then 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each step, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step is manageable.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each step is 3*(1 + previous step). So, if I denote each step as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, yes, the final result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine layers, right? Because each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer, and starting from the innermost, we have nine such layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a layer, and I count nine layers. So, yes, a_9 is the outermost layer, which is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nWe have a_n = 3 + 3a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWe can find B by finding the steady-state solution. Let\u2019s set a_n = a_{n-1} = B.\n\nThen B = 3*(1 + B)\n\nB = 3 + 3B\n\nB - 3B = 3\n\n-2B = 3 => B = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 3/2 = 3A - 3/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nThus, A = 11/(2*3) = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, since 3^n = 3*3^{n-1}, maybe we can write it differently, but perhaps it's not necessary.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nCompute 3280 * 11 = 36,080\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5.\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the closed-form approach.\n\nWait, let me check a_1 using the closed-form formula:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15, which is correct.\n\na_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works, so a_9 = 36,084 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more with the step-by-step approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say the result is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous result), starting from (1 + 3) = 4. By iteratively applying this formula, we compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost expression, resulting in the final value of 36,084.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{36084}$"

Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. It seems like there's a repeating pattern here. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer, perhaps by numbering each parenthesis level. Let's see:\n\nLevel 1: 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nLevel 2: 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nAnd so on, until Level 9, which is the innermost part.\n\nWait, let me count how many levels there are. Starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Then each subsequent level adds another 3(1 + ...) around it. Let me count:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the ninth level.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem has eight sets of parentheses after the first 3. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each step adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3 expressions:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3.\n2. Then it's 1 + 3*(previous result)\n3. Repeating this process eight times.\n\nWait, actually, each time we add another layer, so the number of layers is 8, right? Because starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Then 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Then 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Then 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Then 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Then 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Then 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Then 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Then the outermost 3*(9841) = 29523\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted. Let me try to structure it step by step.\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, E3, ..., E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so E9 is 3*E8, which is correct.\n\nSo, computing each step:\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, but the outermost is just 3*(...). So, perhaps E1 to E8 are the inner expressions, and E9 is the outer 3*(...). So, the total number of multiplications by 3 is 9, but the innermost is E1, so maybe I have 8 layers? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (E1)\n2. 1 + 3*(E1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (E2)\n3. 1 + 3*(E2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (E3)\n4. 1 + 3*(E3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 (E4)\n5. 1 + 3*(E4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 (E5)\n6. 1 + 3*(E5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (E6)\n7. 1 + 3*(E6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (E7)\n8. 1 + 3*(E7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (E8)\n9. 3*(E8) = 3*9841 = 29523 (E9)\n\nSo, E9 is the outermost expression, which is 3*(E8). So, the total computation is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3:\n\nCompute 9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 8 layers, then the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears:\n\nEach time we have a new 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the eighth layer, then the outermost is 3(...).\n\nSo, in total, we have eight layers of 1 + 3(...), and then the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, that would mean E1 to E8 as above, and then E9 is 3*E8.\n\nSo, the computation steps are as I did before, leading to 29523.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify each multiplication:\n\nE1: 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final answer is 29523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by breaking down the nested expression step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3, but it's multiplied by 3. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the inner expression. Hmm, maybe I should write each step separately to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me try to label each layer to keep track. The innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9, I think.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers.

Because each time you have 1 + 3, and then multiplied by 3 again, and this repeats.\n\nWait, maybe I should just start evaluating from the innermost part and work my way out. So, let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just go back and check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for a geometric series or something like that. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, same result. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution to compute a_9 more quickly without computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{10}.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both methods\u2014direct computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014I arrive at the same answer, 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1.

So, let's compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, hold on, is it 1 + 3*(result) or 1 + 3*result? Let me check.\n\nLooking back at the problem, yes, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, second layer: 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute that: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so the second layer gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so the third layer is 40.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute that: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nFourth layer: 121\n\nNext, fifth layer: 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\nFifth layer: 364\n\nMoving on to the sixth layer: 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSixth layer: 1093\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nSeventh layer: 3280\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3 = 9000, 280*3 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nEighth layer: 9841\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 is 29520, +3 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNinth layer: 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression only has nine layers? Let me count the parentheses to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), each multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n\nWait, but when I started computing, I did 9 layers, from 1+3 up to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(that result). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer result.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each layer up to the ninth layer, which is 1 + 3*(result of the eighth layer). Then, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer's result.\n\nWait, so when I computed up to the ninth layer, I got 29524, which is the result of the innermost expression up to that point. But then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, the ninth layer is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this ninth layer.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ninth layer is the innermost, and each layer is built upon that. So, the outermost layer is the first one, which is 3*(...). So, I think I may have miscounted.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), and the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, actually, the innermost is the ninth layer, and the outermost is the first layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, but the entire expression is 3*(...). So, let's see.\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 3*(13) = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 3*(40) = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 3*(121) = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 3*(364) = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 3*(1093) = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 3*(3280) = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 3*(9841) = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so actually, there are 10 layers. The innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) and 1 + ..., and finally, the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, I think I missed the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(...), and the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nSo, let's count the number of times 3*(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 3*(13) = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 3*(40) = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 3*(121) = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 3*(364) = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 3*(1093) = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 3*(3280) = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 3*(9841) = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so the innermost is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) and 1 + ..., up to 9 layers, and then the outermost is 3*(result of the ninth layer). So, total layers are 10.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to 29524, which was the result after 9 layers, but then I forgot to multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nAfter computing up to the ninth layer, we have 29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by this result.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524.\n\nCompute that.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, but 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again, just to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 3*13 = 39; 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 3*40 = 120; 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 3*121 = 363; 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 3*364 = 1092; 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 3*1093 = 3279; 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 3*3280 = 9840; 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 3*9841 = 29523; 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's 10 steps, so the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is to recognize the pattern. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't match. Wait, in my previous computation, I had a_9 as 29524, but in this approach, a_9 would be 88573.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is a_0 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, from a_0 to a_8.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*a_8.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na_0 = 4\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches my earlier computation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_0 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^0 + (-1/2) => 4 = A - 1/2 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 8 (since we have 9 layers, from a_0 to a_8), a_8 = (9*3^8 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo, a_8 = (9*6561 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 9*6561:\n\n6561 * 9:\n\nCompute 6000*9 = 54000\n\n500*9 = 4500\n\n60*9 = 540\n\n1*9 = 9\n\nSo, 54000 + 4500 = 58500\n\n58500 + 540 = 59040\n\n59040 + 9 = 59049\n\nThus, a_8 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 3s and 1s. Starting from the innermost part, we compute each layer step by step by expanding the expression from the inside out. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\). After computing all layers, the final step is to multiply the result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. Innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, I can see that the innermost part is the last \"1+3\". Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the last part. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me make sure I parse this correctly.\n\nWait, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLet me try to parse this step by step. Let's number the layers from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), etc., up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outward, calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Then, moving one layer out, compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer out, compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result), but each time, it's multiplied by 3 in the next layer. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))), so each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but that's only two layers. Wait, no, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define each layer as starting from the innermost and working outward, each time computing the next layer.\n\nLet me try to structure it as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nWait, no, that would mean that Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)).\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nWait, that seems to be the pattern. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nSo, let's go step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Compute the next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(Step 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nStep 3: Compute the next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(Step 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nStep 5: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n\nStep 6: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339.\n\nStep 7: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054.\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489.\n\nStep 9: Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I did each step correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) adds a layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, but when I started counting earlier, I did 9 steps, but maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) from the innermost.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step because that seems like a huge number, and I might have made a calculation error somewhere.\n\nLet me go through each step again carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, it seems the calculation is correct. Therefore, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nBut wait, that seems really large. Let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this problem, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + 3*L_1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + 3*L_2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is L_n = 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1})\n\nWe can try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nLet's write the recursion:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1})\n\nWe can expand this recursion:\n\nL_n = 3 + 9*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from L_n - 9*L_{n-1} = 3.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is L_n - 9*L_{n-1} = 3.\n\nTo solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 9*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 9 = 0, so r = 9. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*9^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nA - 9*A = 3\n\n-8*A = 3\n\nA = -3/8\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*9^n - 3/8.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*9^1 - 3/8\n\n4 = 9C - 3/8\n\nAdd 3/8 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/8 = 9C\n\n35/8 = 9C\n\nC = (35/8)/9 = 35/(8*9) = 35/72\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nSimplify:\n\n(35/72)*9^n = (35/72)*(9^n) = (35/72)*(9^n) = (35/72)*(9^n)\n\nBut 9^n = 9*9^{n-1}, so maybe we can write it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute L_n using this formula.\n\nGiven that n=9, since there are 9 layers.\n\nSo, L_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8\n\nBut 9^9 is a huge number. Let me compute it:\n\n9^1 = 9\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n9^4 = 6561\n\n9^5 = 59049\n\n9^6 = 531441\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\n9^8 = 43046721\n\n9^9 = 387420489\n\nSo, 9^9 = 387,420,489\n\nNow, compute (35/72)*387,420,489.\n\nFirst, compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n72 \u00d7 5,380,000 = 72 \u00d7 5,000,000 = 360,000,000\n\n72 \u00d7 380,000 = 72 \u00d7 300,000 = 21,600,000; 72 \u00d7 80,000 = 5,760,000 \u2192 Total 21,600,000 + 5,760,000 = 27,360,000\n\nSo, 72 \u00d7 5,380,000 = 360,000,000 + 27,360,000 = 387,360,000\n\nNow, 387,420,489 - 387,360,000 = 60,489\n\nSo, 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 = 5,380,000 + (60,489 \u00f7 72)\n\nCompute 60,489 \u00f7 72:\n\n72 \u00d7 800 = 57,600\n\n60,489 - 57,600 = 2,889\n\n72 \u00d7 40 = 2,880\n\n2,889 - 2,880 = 9\n\nSo, 72 \u00d7 800 + 72 \u00d7 40 + 9 = 840 + 9 = 849, but wait, that can't be right because 72 \u00d7 840 = 60,480, and then 9 left, so it's 840 + (9/72) = 840 + 0.125 = 840.125\n\nWait, but that would make the total 5,380,000 + 840.125 = 5,380,840.125\n\nWait, that seems off because 72 \u00d7 5,380,840.125 = 387,420,489\n\nBut I think I made a miscalculation in the division.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 as follows:\n\n72 \u00d7 5,380,000 = 387,360,000\n\nSubtract that from 387,420,489: 387,420,489 - 387,360,000 = 60,489\n\nNow, compute 60,489 \u00f7 72:\n\n72 \u00d7 800 = 57,600\n\n60,489 - 57,600 = 2,889\n\n72 \u00d7 40 = 2,880\n\n2,889 - 2,880 = 9\n\nSo, 72 \u00d7 840 = 60,480, and then 9 remains, which is 72 \u00d7 0.125 = 9.\n\nThus, 60,489 \u00f7 72 = 840 + 0.125 = 840.125\n\nTherefore, total is 5,380,000 + 840.125 = 5,380,840.125\n\nNow, multiply by 35:\n\n35 \u00d7 5,380,840.125\n\nCompute 35 \u00d7 5,380,840 = ?\n\nWell, 35 \u00d7 5,000,000 = 175,000,000\n\n35 \u00d7 380,840 = ?\n\nCompute 35 \u00d7 300,000 = 10,500,000\n\n35 \u00d7 80,840 = ?\n\n35 \u00d7 80,000 = 2,800,000\n\n35 \u00d7 840 = 29,400\n\nSo, 2,800,000 + 29,400 = 2,829,400\n\nNow, 35 \u00d7 380,840 = 10,500,000 + 2,829,400 = 13,329,400\n\nNow, 35 \u00d7 0.125 = 4.375\n\nSo, total is 175,000,000 + 13,329,400 + 4.375 = 188,329,404.375\n\nNow, subtract 3/8:\n\n3/8 = 0.375\n\nSo, 188,329,404.375 - 0.375 = 188,329,404\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by step-by-step calculation. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nI think that's correct. Although it's a very large number, the step-by-step approach and the closed-form solution both lead to the same result, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated by multiplying 3 with (1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{188329404}$"

It seems like there's a pattern here where each part is 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works for these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext level out: 1 + 3*13.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(result from the previous level). So starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So let's list them out step by step.\n\nLet me number the levels from the innermost to the outermost as levels 1 through 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(...). So after computing Level 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo the total would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because that seems a bit high. Let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier levels. Let me go through each level again to confirm.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, okay, that seems consistent.\n\nWait a second, but let me check Level 9 again because when I computed Level 9, I thought it was 1 + 3*(Level 8). Level 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's exponential growth, so maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something like that.\n\nLet me think. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it in a general form.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a linear function, I think. Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 levels, starting from n=1 to n=9.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: Level 1 corresponds to n=1, so a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Level 9, which is the innermost expression before multiplying by 3 at the very end, is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYep, same result.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

There are a lot of parentheses, so I think I need to work from the innermost part outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions because the innermost one will be the simplest, and then each layer adds a bit more complexity.\n\nSo, the expression is built like this: starting from the innermost 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me try to count how many layers there are here. Let me see: starting from the innermost (1+3), then each time wrapping another 3*(1+...) around it. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, looking at the problem again, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time adding another layer.

So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and working outwards to the first layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the inside and working my way out. So, the innermost part is (1+3), then the next layer is 3*(1+3*(innermost)), and so on, up to the outermost layer.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, maybe the innermost is L9 and the outermost is L1? No, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost as L1 and work outwards. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outwards, so let me define each layer starting from the innermost as L1, then each subsequent layer as L2, L3, etc., up to L9, since I can see that there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1+... So, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first layer, then each time wrapping another 3*(1+... around it. So, from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and each layer is built by adding another 3*(1+... So, perhaps I should work from the innermost outwards, calculating each layer step by step.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to start from the innermost expression and compute each layer one by one, then substitute the result into the next layer. Let's try that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part: (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + L1). So, substituting L1 = 4, we get:\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer out is 3*(1 + L2). So, substituting L2 = 15:\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nNext layer:\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nNext:\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 1 + 147 is 148, and 3*148 is indeed 444.\n\nNext layer:\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nWait, 1 + 444 is 445, times 3 is 1335.\n\nNext:\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nWait, 1 + 1335 is 1336, times 3 is 4008.\n\nNext layer:\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nWait, 1 + 4008 is 4009, times 3 is 12027.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer:\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. 1 + 12027 is 12028, times 3 is indeed 36084.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers I actually have. Starting from L1 as the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer up to L9. But when I look back at the original problem, it's 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with 9 layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, there's an opening parenthesis, and each layer adds another. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: starting from the first ( after 3, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, which would mean 9 layers. But when I was computing earlier, I went up to L9, which would be the 9th layer. So, perhaps my initial count was correct.\n\nWait, but when I started computing, I took the innermost as L1, which was (1+3), then each layer outwards as L2, L3, etc., up to L9. So, that would mean that I computed 9 layers, each time substituting the previous result into the next layer.\n\nWait, but when I did that, I ended up with L9 being 36084. But let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. Each step, I'm adding 1 to the previous layer's result and multiplying by 3.\n\nBut let me check L9 again: 1 + 12027 is indeed 12028, and 3*12028 is 36084. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a certain progression. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer.\n\nLooking at the results:\n\nL1: 4\n\nL2: 15\n\nL3: 48\n\nL4: 147\n\nL5: 444\n\nL6: 1335\n\nL7: 4008\n\nL8: 12027\n\nL9: 36084\n\nHmm, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, each term can be expressed as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write it as:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3\n\n-2*C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. Let's take n=1: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 11/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216,513 - 9)/6 = 216,504/6 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer up to n=9, which gives us the final result of 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for L9 again, just to be sure.\n\nL8 was 12,027.\n\nSo, L9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*(12,028) = 36,084.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\n3^9 is 19,683.\n\nSo, 11*19,683 = 216,513.\n\n216,513 - 9 = 216,504.\n\n216,504 divided by 6 is 36,084. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but just to ensure I didn't make any miscalculations in the formula, let me compute 3^9 again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 11*19683: Let's compute 10*19683 = 196,830, plus 1*19683 = 19683, so total is 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513. Then subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504. Then divide by 6: 216,504 \u00f7 6.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3.\n\n6 into 36 (3*10 + 6) is 6, remainder 0.\n\n6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5.\n\n6 into 50 (5*10 + 0) is 8, remainder 2.\n\n6 into 24 (2*10 + 4) is 4, remainder 0.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, 6*36,000 = 216,000.\n\nSo, 216,504 - 216,000 = 504.\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84.\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nSo, all my calculations check out. Therefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step, so I'm confident in the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost layer and work our way outwards.

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting overwhelmed.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, I see a series of \"1 + 3\" inside multiple parentheses. The innermost one seems to be the last one: \\(1 + 3\\). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). That simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is \\(1 + 3(1 + 3)\\). Wait, but since I've already computed the innermost part as 4, this becomes \\(1 + 3 \\times 4\\). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, I need to do the multiplication before addition. So, \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\). Then, add 1: \\(1 + 12 = 13\\). Okay, so that simplifies the next layer to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression becomes \\(1 + 3(13)\\). Again, I'll compute the multiplication first: \\(3 \\times 13 = 39\\). Then, add 1: \\(1 + 39 = 40\\). So, this layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is \\(1 + 3(40)\\). Multiplying first: \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\). Then, add 1: \\(1 + 120 = 121\\). So, now we have 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's \\(1 + 3(121)\\). Let's compute that: \\(3 \\times 121 = 363\\), then add 1: \\(1 + 363 = 364\\). So, this simplifies to 364.\n\nNext layer: \\(1 + 3(364)\\). Calculating the multiplication: \\(3 \\times 364 = 1092\\). Then, add 1: \\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\). So, this part becomes 1093.\n\nContinuing, the next expression is \\(1 + 3(1093)\\). Let's compute that: \\(3 \\times 1093 = 3279\\). Adding 1 gives \\(1 + 3279 = 3280\\). So, now we have 3280.\n\nNext layer: \\(1 + 3(3280)\\). Multiplying first: \\(3 \\times 3280 = 9840\\). Then, add 1: \\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\). So, this simplifies to 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's \\(1 + 3(9841)\\). Let's compute that: \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\). Adding 1: \\(1 + 29523 = 29524\\). So, this becomes 29524.\n\nNext, the expression is \\(1 + 3(29524)\\). Calculating the multiplication: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\). Then, add 1: \\(1 + 88572 = 88573\\). So, this simplifies to 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's \\(1 + 3(88573)\\). Let's compute that: \\(3 \\times 88573 = 265719\\). Adding 1: \\(1 + 265719 = 265720\\). So, this part becomes 265720.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is \\(3 \\times 265720\\). Let's compute that: \\(3 \\times 265720 = 797160\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to get lost with so many layers. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n10. \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\)\n11. \\(1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\\)\n12. \\(3 \\times 265720 = 797160\\)\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I didn't spot any calculation errors upon reviewing. So, I think the final result is 797,160.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern here. Let's see, each time I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's almost like a geometric series or something, but with each term building on the previous one. Let me try to see if I can represent this as a recursive formula or find a pattern.\n\nLet's denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, which is \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\). Then, each subsequent layer is \\(a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\). So, we can write:\n\n- \\(a_1 = 4\\)\n- \\(a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- \\(a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- \\(a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- \\(a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- \\(a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- \\(a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- \\(a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- \\(a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n- \\(a_{10} = 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 88573\\)\n- \\(a_{11} = 1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 265720\\)\n\nThen, the final result is \\(3 \\times a_{11} = 3 \\times 265720 = 797160\\). Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for \\(a_n\\) without computing each step. Since each term is defined by \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\), this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is \\(a_n = A \\times 3^n + B\\), where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. Given the recurrence \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\), and the initial condition \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: \\(a_n^{(h)} = A \\times 3^n\\).\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume \\(a_n^{(p)} = C\\). Plugging into the recurrence:\n\n\\(C = 3C + 1\\)\n\nSolving for C:\n\n\\(C - 3C = 1\\)\n\n\\(-2C = 1\\)\n\n\\(C = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nSo, the general solution is \\(a_n = A \\times 3^n - \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition \\(a_1 = 4\\):\n\n\\(4 = A \\times 3^1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\n\\(4 = 3A - \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nAdd \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to both sides:\n\n\\(4 + \\frac{1}{2} = 3A\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{9}{2} = 3A\\)\n\n\\(A = \\frac{9}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\nSo, the general formula is \\(a_n = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 3^n - \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSimplify that:\n\n\\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\)\n\nLet me test this formula with \\(n = 1\\):\n\n\\(a_1 = \\frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = \\frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4\\). Correct.\n\n\\(n = 2\\):\n\n\\(a_2 = \\frac{3^{3} - 1}{2} = \\frac{27 - 1}{2} = 13\\). Correct.\n\n\\(n = 3\\):\n\n\\(a_3 = \\frac{3^{4} - 1}{2} = \\frac{81 - 1}{2} = 40\\). Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer \\(n\\), \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of times the expression \\(1 + 3(...)\\) appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. \\(1 + 3\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3(...)\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3(...)\\)\n...\nUp to the 9th layer because the original expression has nine sets of parentheses after the first 3(...). Wait, let me count again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of \\(1 + 3(...)\\). Therefore, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, \\(a_9\\) would be the value before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 11 layers, but that was counting each \\(1 + 3(...)\\) as a separate step. Maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me re-examine the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\", which means 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, using the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), for n=9:\n\n\\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}\\)\n\nCompute \\(3^{10}\\):\n\n\\(3^1 = 3\\)\n\n\\(3^2 = 9\\)\n\n\\(3^3 = 27\\)\n\n\\(3^4 = 81\\)\n\n\\(3^5 = 243\\)\n\n\\(3^6 = 729\\)\n\n\\(3^7 = 2187\\)\n\n\\(3^8 = 6561\\)\n\n\\(3^9 = 19683\\)\n\n\\(3^{10} = 59049\\)\n\nSo, \\(a_9 = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\frac{59048}{2} = 29524\\). Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, after 9 layers, I had \\(a_9 = 29524\\), which matches. Then, moving out, the next layer would be \\(a_{10} = 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 88573\\), and then \\(a_{11} = 1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 265720\\), and finally, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 797160.\n\nBut wait, if n=9 corresponds to \\(a_9 = 29524\\), then the expression after that is 3 times \\(a_{11}\\), which is 3 times 265720. So, 3*265720=797160.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). So, if we have 9 layers, then \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Then, the next layer would be \\(a_{10} = 1 + 3 \\times a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 88573\\), and \\(a_{11} = 1 + 3 \\times a_{10} = 265720\\). So, the final result is 3 times \\(a_{11}\\), which is 797160.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me see.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich is 3 times \\(a_9\\), but wait, no. Because each layer is built upon the previous one. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3 times \\(a_9\\), but according to my earlier step-by-step, it was 3 times \\(a_{11}\\). Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, no. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression, which has 9 layers. So, the nested expression is \\(a_9\\), which is 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I got 797160.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Maybe my formula approach is missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the formula, \\(a_n\\) represents the value after n layers of \\(1 + 3(...)\\). So, if the original expression is 3 times the 9th layer, then it's 3 * \\(a_9\\), which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. But in my step-by-step, I ended up with 797160. That's a big discrepancy. So, I must have made a mistake in either the formula or the step-by-step.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nSo, 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nSo, the entire nested part is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to layer 11, getting 265720, and then 3*265720=797160. So, clearly, I overcounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers in the original expression. Let me look again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n\nSo, 9 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is 1 + 3 =4, and the outermost is layer 9: 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I ended up with 797160. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers when I did the step-by-step. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. \\(1 + 3 =4\\)\n\n2. \\(1 + 3*4=13\\)\n\n3. \\(1 +3*13=40\\)\n\n4. \\(1 +3*40=121\\)\n\n5. \\(1 +3*121=364\\)\n\n6. \\(1 +3*364=1093\\)\n\n7. \\(1 +3*1093=3280\\)\n\n8. \\(1 +3*3280=9841\\)\n\n9. \\(1 +3*9841=29524\\)\n\n10. \\(1 +3*29524=88573\\)\n\n11. \\(1 +3*88573=265720\\)\n\n12. \\(3*265720=797160\\)\n\nWait, so in my step-by-step, I went beyond 9 layers because I was counting each \"1 + 3(...)\" after the initial 3 as a separate layer. But in reality, the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3. Therefore, the correct number of layers is 9, leading to the nested expression being 29524, and the entire expression being 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, my mistake was in the step-by-step approach where I continued beyond the 9 layers, which wasn't part of the original problem. Therefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 797160.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. Let me parse the original expression again carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. The first one after the initial 3: 3(1 + 3(\n2. Then another: 3(1 + 3(\n3. And so on, until the 9th one: 3(1 + 3\n\nSo, 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is 1 +3=4, and each layer adds one more 3(...). So, after 9 layers, the nested part is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers, leading me to an incorrect final answer. The correct approach is to recognize that there are 9 layers, leading to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} -1}{2}\\), for n=9:\n\n\\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} -1}{2} = \\frac{59049 -1}{2} = 29524\\). Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers again. Let me write out the expression with each layer numbered:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, leading to 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I continued beyond the 9 layers, but the problem only has 9 layers. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again to ensure I didn't miscount. The problem is:\n\nCompute \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\)\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nSo, 9 times. Therefore, 9 layers. So, the correct answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial mistake was in the step-by-step where I continued beyond the 9 layers, leading to an incorrect result. The correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more with the formula. For n=9, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} -1}{2} = 29524\\). Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it directly by expanding the expression.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step, but this time correctly stopping at 9 layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers, but now I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\)\n\nWe start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

Each layer seems to follow a similar pattern: 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So, it's like a chain of these operations. I think the way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, so each time, it's 3 times (1 plus another expression). Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let's count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis without a corresponding closing one before the end is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Then inside that, another 3 times (1 + ...), and so on. Let me count the number of times 3(1 + ... occurs. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of this 3(1 + ...) structure. So, I need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one, which is the 9th layer, and then work my way back to the outermost one.\n\nLet me represent each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, no, that might get confusing. Maybe it's better to label them from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, which is 3(1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 3(1 + result of Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, but looking at the original problem, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because in the innermost parentheses, it's 1 + 3. So, let me confirm:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result plus 1. Wait, no, hold on. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take a smaller version to understand the pattern. Suppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, moving out another layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nSo, in this smaller example, the result is 48.\n\nWait, so each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous).\n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, which has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), let me confirm how many layers there are.\n\nWait, in the original problem, starting from the left, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + ...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), which is the outermost layer. But the innermost is the last 1 + 3.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer out: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but hold on. How many layers did I compute? Let's see: starting from 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent step is layer 2, 3, etc. So, if I did 9 layers, then the result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 3(1+... parts. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one layer. Then inside that, another 3(1 + ...), so that's two layers, and so on until the innermost 1 + 3. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. So, let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's parse it:\n\n- 3(1+3( ... )) : first layer\n- The inner part is 1+3( ... ), so that's the second layer\n- Inside that is 1+3( ... ), third layer\n- And so on, until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, the first layer is 3*(1 + ...), the second layer is the inner 3*(1 + ...), etc.\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 9. Then layer 8 is 3*(1 + layer9), layer7 is 3*(1 + layer8), etc., up to layer1, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, so if I start from layer9, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then layer8 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, layer7 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, layer6 is 3*(1 + 48) = 147, layer5 is 3*(1 + 147) = 444, layer4 is 3*(1 + 444) = 1335, layer3 is 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008, layer2 is 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027, and finally layer1 is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Because the original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so layer1 is the outermost, which is 3*(1 + layer2). So, if I compute layer9 first, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then layer8 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, layer7 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on until layer1 is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nSo, the final result would be 36084.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with layer9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step is 3 times (1 plus the previous result). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous).\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given the small number of layers (9), computing step by step seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let's think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in this case, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4, and each subsequent layer is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, for n=1: a1 = 4\n\nn=2: a2 = 3*(1 + a1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nn=3: a3 = 3*(1 + a2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on, up to n=9.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a1=4.\n\nWait, no, actually, let's see:\n\nWait, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, it's a linear recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 3.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1=4.\n\nWhen n=1: a1 = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3C - 3/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nBut let's compute it for n=9.\n\nWait, but in our case, n starts at 1, corresponding to the innermost layer. So, for the outermost layer, which is layer9, n=9.\n\nWait, no, actually, in our earlier step-by-step, layer9 was the innermost, which is a1=4, and layer1 is the outermost, which would be a9.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused with the indexing. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the recurrence, a1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a2 is the next layer out, which is 3*(1 + a1) = 15.\n\nSo, a_n corresponds to the nth layer from the inside.\n\nTherefore, for the outermost layer, which is the 9th layer from the inside, we need a9.\n\nSo, using the general solution:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nBut let's check for n=1: a1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = 11/2 - 3/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2: a2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, compute a9:\n\na9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nFirst, compute 3^9.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683.\n\nNow, compute (11/6)*19683.\n\nFirst, compute 19683 / 6.\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11.\n\nCompute 3280.5 * 10 = 32805\n\nAdd 3280.5: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5\n\nThen, subtract 3/2: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nSo, a9 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, without using the formula, computing step by step as I did earlier also gives 36084, so that's consistent.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recount the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's nine layers, each time multiplying 3*(1 + previous result), starting from 4, and ending up with 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly applying the operation \\( 3 \\times (1 + \\text{previous result}) \\) starting from the innermost layer. By systematically evaluating each layer from the inside out, we find that the result is 36084.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\( 3 \\times (1 + \\text{result of the next layer}) \\). The innermost layer is \\( 1 + 3 \\).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 9 (innermost): \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Work Outwards Layer by Layer:**\n   - Layer 8: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\).\n   - Layer 7: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\).\n   - Layer 6: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\).\n   - Layer 5: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\).\n   - Layer 4: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335 \\).\n   - Layer 3: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008 \\).\n   - Layer 2: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027 \\).\n   - Layer 1 (outermost): \\( 3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084 \\).\n\n4. **Final Result:** After computing each layer step by step, the outermost result is 36084.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{36084}"

Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. I think that's usually the best approach with these kinds of nested parentheses.\n\nAlright, so the innermost part is the last \"1+3\". Let me write that down:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking at the structure, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous expression). So let me try to parse this correctly.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(first layer) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I should write each step clearly.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me check: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So let's list each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute: 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute: 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute: 3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute: 3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute: 3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so after layer 9, the innermost expression simplifies to 29524. But wait, looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So after computing the innermost nine layers, we have 29524, and then we multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, final step: 3 * 29524\n\nCompute that: 3*29524. Let's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nNext, 3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, so adding each part:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n= 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as a geometric series, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable and less error-prone.\n\nWait, another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value at layer n. Then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, a_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the innermost expression is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula confirms the result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each layer step by step, and also derived a formula to compute the nth term, which gives the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by simplifying from the innermost layer outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\), with nine layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Simplify from the innermost layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let me try to understand what's going on here. It seems like there are a bunch of nested expressions where each one is of the form 1 + 3(something). Each time, it's multiplied by 3 on the outside. So, maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, I can compute this without getting lost.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times the result from step 1.\n3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3 times the result from step 2.\n4. This pattern continues until I get to the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, maybe I can approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outward, each time substituting the computed value into the next layer. Let me try that.\n\nLet's denote each layer as follows:\n\n- Let\u2019s call the innermost expression A\u2081 = 1 + 3\n- Then, moving out, A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081\n- Then, A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082\n- And so on, until A\u2089, since there are nine layers in total.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of parentheses to make sure. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each time, we have another layer, so counting each opening parenthesis, how many do we have? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3\" is a separate layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach time, it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let me count the number of 1+3 parts:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. ... and so on, until we have nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, I think I miscounted. Let me try to count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach time, it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\n- The first layer: 1+3(\n- The second layer: 1+3(1+3(\n- Wait, actually, each time it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply by 3 because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the nested expression. So, the outermost operation is multiplying the result of the nested expression by 3.\n\nBut wait, in my layers above, I went from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 9 would be the innermost expression, but in the problem, the innermost is 1+3, so perhaps I need to adjust my counting.\n\nWait, perhaps I have 9 layers of 1+3*(...), starting from the innermost. Let me try to recount.\n\nWait, maybe I should number the layers starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...).\n\nSo, starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the structure is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nCompute digit by digit from right to left:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nLet me compute Layer 9 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524*3 again.\n\n29524*3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n= 20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\nAdding them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, with A\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for A\u2099.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is A\u2099 = C*3\u207f + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for C and D.\n\nWe have A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nAssume A\u2099 = C*3\u207f + D.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC*3\u207f + D = 1 + 3*(C*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + D)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n= 1 + 3*C*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + 3D\n= 1 + C*3\u207f + 3D\n\nSo, LHS: C*3\u207f + D\nRHS: 1 + C*3\u207f + 3D\n\nSet equal:\n\nC*3\u207f + D = 1 + C*3\u207f + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3\u207f from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition A\u2081 = 4.\n\nA\u2081 = C*3\u00b9 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is A\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer n, A\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\nA\u2081 = (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: A\u2082=(3\u00b3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: A\u2083=(3\u2074 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, A\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3\u00b9\u2070:\n\n3\u00b9=3\n\n3\u00b2=9\n\n3\u00b3=27\n\n3\u2074=81\n\n3\u2075=243\n\n3\u2076=729\n\n3\u2077=2187\n\n3\u2078=6561\n\n3\u2079=19683\n\n3\u00b9\u2070=59049\n\nThus, A\u2089=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*A\u2089=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series or something, but since each layer is a linear function of the previous, the recurrence approach seems the most straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you have 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nIn any case, the step-by-step computation seems solid, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of the form 1 + 3(...). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that each layer follows the pattern A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, leading to a closed-form formula. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested expressions with 3s and 1s. Let me try to figure this out. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested parentheses.\n\nSo, let's see. The innermost part is the very last part of the expression, which is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The innermost was the last (1+3), so replacing that with 4, so the next layer out is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Hmm, maybe I should write each step down as I go.\n\nLet me try to number each step. Let's say each layer corresponds to a certain level of parentheses. There are nine layers here, so I'll compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer, which is layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving to layer 8, which is the next one out. It's 1 + 3*(result from layer 9). So that would be:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So each time, I compute the innermost layer first, then work my way outwards.\n\nSo, let me list the layers from innermost (layer 1) to outermost (layer 9). Wait, actually, the problem has nine layers of 1+3(...), so maybe I should number them from the innermost as layer 1 up to layer 9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write it out step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, which is layer 2:\n\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, layer 3:\n\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems correct.\n\nProceeding to layer 4:\n\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's correct.\n\nLayer 5:\n\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nHmm, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay.\n\nLayer 6:\n\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWait, 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That's correct.\n\nLayer 7:\n\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Yes.\n\nLayer 8:\n\n8. Layer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:\n\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So that's the result of the innermost nine layers.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So after computing the innermost parentheses up to layer 9, which gives 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524).\n\nSo, let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. 29524 times 3.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula here that could be applied, but since the problem is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually seems feasible.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't miscalculate any of the layers, because if I made a mistake in one layer, it would propagate all the way through.\n\nLet me recheck each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

It seems like a series of additions and multiplications, with each step involving 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). Since it's all nested, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, let me write this out step by step. I'll start from the innermost part and compute each layer one by one.\n\nFirst, the innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that first innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)), where the ... was the innermost part we just computed. So, substituting that in, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, 3*(4) is 12, and 1 + 12 is indeed 13. Got it.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(13)). Let me compute that:\n\n3*13 = 39\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, so that layer gives me 40.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(40)). Let's compute that:\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nOkay, so now we have 121.\n\nNext layer out is (1 + 3*(121)). Calculating that:\n\n3*121 = 363\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo, that's 364.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is (1 + 3*(364)). Let me compute that:\n\n3*364 = 1092\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, that's a big number. So, 1093.\n\nNext layer is (1 + 3*(1093)). Let's do that:\n\n3*1093 = 3279\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWow, that's getting large quickly.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*(3280)). Calculating:\n\n3*3280 = 9840\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nAlright, so now we're at 9841.\n\nNext layer is (1 + 3*(9841)). Let me compute that:\n\n3*9841 = 29523\n\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, that's 29524.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, we have (1 + 3*(29524)). Let's calculate this:\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\n1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check how many layers we've gone through because the original expression has multiple layers, and I want to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3*(result1))\n3. Next: (1+3*(result2))\n4. Next: (1+3*(result3))\n5. Next: (1+3*(result4))\n6. Next: (1+3*(result5))\n7. Next: (1+3*(result6))\n8. Next: (1+3*(result7))\n9. Next: (1+3*(result8))\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)) starting from the innermost. But when I started computing, I only went through 8 layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nWait, so actually, I did compute up to the 9th layer, which gives 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3*(29524). Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that's 88572. But earlier, when I computed (1 + 3*9841), I got 29524. So, now, multiplying 3*29524 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check that multiplication because I might have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 7 7 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that would be 877572? No, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be less than 90000, right?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the place values.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, let's index the terms properly. Let's say n=1 corresponds to the innermost term, which is 4.\n\nThen, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nTo solve this recurrence, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form formula\u2014we arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1.

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let's see. It's a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, the innermost part here is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next part is (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the result from the first step. So, substituting the result:\n\n2. Compute (1 + 3 * 4). Wait, hold on, is it 3 times the result or just 3 added? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nLooking back, the structure is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So actually, each step is 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the previous result). So, I need to be careful with the order of operations here.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify the structure. Let me rewrite the entire expression to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nSo, maybe it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(result1))\n3. Then 3*(1 + 3*(result2))\n4. And so on, until we get to the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times (1 + 3(...)) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1))\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer2))\n...\nContinuing until Layer9, since I see 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)) before the outermost 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nContinuing until we reach the outermost.\n\nI think there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)) inside the initial 3(...). So, we'll have to compute 9 layers, each time plugging the result into the next layer.\n\nSo, let's start computing each layer step by step.\n\n**Layer 1: (1 + 3)**\nCompute the innermost parentheses first.\n1 + 3 = 4\nSo, Layer1 = 4\n\n**Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1))**\nPlugging Layer1 into Layer2:\n3*(1 + 3*4)\nFirst compute 3*4 = 12\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\nThen, 3*13 = 39\nSo, Layer2 = 39\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, for Layer2, it's 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)).\n\nYes, so 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\n**Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer2))**\nPlugging Layer2 into Layer3:\n3*(1 + 3*39)\nCompute 3*39 first: 39*3 = 117\nThen, 1 + 117 = 118\nThen, 3*118 = 354\nSo, Layer3 = 354\n\n**Layer 4: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer3))**\nPlugging Layer3 into Layer4:\n3*(1 + 3*354)\nCompute 3*354: 354*3 = 1062\nThen, 1 + 1062 = 1063\nThen, 3*1063 = 3189\nSo, Layer4 = 3189\n\nWait a second, this is getting big quickly. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13=39 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117)=3*118=354 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*354)=3*(1 + 1062)=3*1063=3189 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, seems correct so far.\n\n**Layer 5: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer4))**\nPlugging Layer4 into Layer5:\n3*(1 + 3*3189)\nCompute 3*3189: Let's calculate that.\n\n3189 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 189*3=567, so total 9000 + 567 = 9567\n\nThen, 1 + 9567 = 9568\n\nThen, 3*9568: Let's compute that.\n\n9568 * 3:\n\nFirst, 9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n60*3=180\n\n8*3=24\n\nSo, adding up: 27000 + 1500 = 28500; 28500 + 180 = 28680; 28680 +24=28704\n\nSo, Layer5 = 28704\n\n**Layer 6: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer5))**\nPlugging Layer5 into Layer6:\n3*(1 + 3*28704)\n\nCompute 3*28704:\n\n28704 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n8000*3=24000\n\n700*3=2100\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding up: 60000 +24000=84000; 84000 +2100=86100; 86100 +12=86112\n\nThen, 1 + 86112 = 86113\n\nThen, 3*86113: Let's compute that.\n\n86113 * 3:\n\n80000*3=240000\n\n6000*3=18000\n\n100*3=300\n\n10*3=30\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding up: 240000 +18000=258000; 258000 +300=258300; 258300 +30=258330; 258330 +9=258339\n\nSo, Layer6 = 258339\n\n**Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer6))**\nPlugging Layer6 into Layer7:\n3*(1 + 3*258339)\n\nCompute 3*258339:\n\n258339 * 3:\n\n200000*3=600000\n\n50000*3=150000\n\n8000*3=24000\n\n300*3=900\n\n30*3=90\n\n9*3=27\n\nAdding up: 600000 +150000=750000; 750000 +24000=774000; 774000 +900=774900; 774900 +90=774990; 774990 +27=774,990 +27=775,017\n\nWait, 774,990 +27 is 775,017?

So, do we have another layer? Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer1)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39 (Layer2)\n3. 3*(1 + 3*39) = 354 (Layer3)\n4. 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3189 (Layer4)\n5. 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 28704 (Layer5)\n6. 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 258339 (Layer6)\n7. 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 2,325,054 (Layer7)\n8. 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 20,925,489 (Layer8)\n9. 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 188,329,404 (Layer9)\n\nBut looking back at the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, if we have 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)), then after computing Layer9, we have the outermost 3*(Layer9). Wait, but in my previous computation, Layer9 was the result after 9 layers, which would be the outermost. But the original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 9 layers deep. So, perhaps my initial count was correct, and Layer9 is the outermost, so the total result is Layer9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)).

Wait, but in my previous computation, Layer9 was already 3*(...), so maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of 3s multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39\n3. 3*(1 + 3*39) = 354\n4. 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3189\n5. 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 28704\n6. 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 258339\n7. 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 2,325,054\n8. 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 20,925,489\n9. 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 188,329,404\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 188,329,404. But in the original expression, is this the outermost layer? Let me check.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)), each time nesting deeper.\n\nSo, the total computation would be 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the innermost is (1 + 3). So, after computing 9 layers, we get 188,329,404, which is the result of the entire expression.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) layers.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1 + 3*(...)) is a new layer. So, how many 3*(...) are there?\n\nLet's see:\n\n- The first 3 is outside, then inside it is (1 + 3*(...)). The innermost is (1 + 3). So, each (1 + 3*(...)) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the number of 3*(...) as 9, because from the innermost (1+3) up to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers, each time computing 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)), starting from (1+3)=4.\n\nSo, if I have 9 layers, then the final result is Layer9=188,329,404.\n\nBut let me check the structure again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each (1 + 3*(...)) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*13=39? Wait, no, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, step by step:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to parse it differently.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, that might be a better approach. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 3*(1 + 3*f(1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 +12)=3*13=39\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 3*f(2))=3*(1 + 3*39)=3*(1 +117)=3*118=354\n\nf(4)=3*(1 +3*f(3))=3*(1 +3*354)=3*(1 +1062)=3*1063=3189\n\nf(5)=3*(1 +3*f(4))=3*(1 +3*3189)=3*(1 +9567)=3*9568=28704\n\nf(6)=3*(1 +3*f(5))=3*(1 +3*28704)=3*(1 +86112)=3*86113=258339\n\nf(7)=3*(1 +3*f(6))=3*(1 +3*258339)=3*(1 +775,017)=3*775,018=2,325,054\n\nf(8)=3*(1 +3*f(7))=3*(1 +3*2,325,054)=3*(1 +6,975,162)=3*6,975,163=20,925,489\n\nf(9)=3*(1 +3*f(8))=3*(1 +3*20,925,489)=3*(1 +62,776,467)=3*62,776,468=188,329,404\n\nSo, f(9)=188,329,404.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 188,329,404.\n\nBut let me make sure that f(9) corresponds to the outermost layer. Since the original expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), starting from f(1) up to f(9). So, yes, f(9) is the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses:\n  \\[\n  1 + 3 = 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Layer 2**: Substitute Layer 1 into the next layer:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 4) = 3 \\times 13 = 39\n  \\]\n  \n- **Layer 3**: Substitute Layer 2 into the next layer:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 39) = 3 \\times 118 = 354\n  \\]\n  \n- **Layer 4**: Substitute Layer 3 into the next layer:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 354) = 3 \\times 1063 = 3189\n  \\]\n  \n- **Layer 5**: Substitute Layer 4 into the next layer:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 3189) = 3 \\times 9568 = 28704\n  \\]\n  \n- **Layer 6**: Substitute Layer 5 into the next layer:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 28704) = 3 \\times 86113 = 258339\n  \\]\n  \n- **Layer 7**: Substitute Layer 6 into the next layer:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 258339) = 3 \\times 775018 = 2325054\n  \\]\n  \n- **Layer 8**: Substitute Layer 7 into the next layer:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 2325054) = 3 \\times 6975163 = 20925489\n  \\]\n  \n- **Layer 9**: Substitute Layer 8 into the next layer:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 20925489) = 3 \\times 62776468 = 188329404\n  \\]\n\nThus, the value of the entire expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{188329404}$"

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me try to visualize this structure. Each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. So it's like a chain of operations.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to see it clearly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count how many times this happens. Each time, there's a 1 + 3, then multiplied by 3, and added to 1, and so on. It seems like there are nine sets of parentheses here. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(result of step 2)\n...\nThis goes on until step 9.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to number them from the inside out. Let's define each step as S1, S2, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost expression.\n\nSo, S1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen S2 = 1 + 3*S1\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2\n\nAnd so on, until S9, and the final result is 3*S9.\n\nOkay, that seems manageable. Let me compute each step one by one.\n\nStarting with S1:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nGot that. Now, S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nCalculating 3*4: 3*4=12\n\nSo S2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to S3:\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39\n\nSo S3 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext, S4:\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120\n\nSo S4 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, S4 is 121. Let's go to S5:\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let me compute that. 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360+3=363\n\nSo S5 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nMoving on to S6:\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364\n\nCalculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092\n\nSo S6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNow, S7:\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093: Let me break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279\n\nSo S7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext up, S8:\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840\n\nSo S8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nFinally, S9:\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo S9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the final step is to compute 3*S9, which is the entire expression.\n\nSo, 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo writing it all together: 8 7 7 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try that again, maybe I messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88 572.\n\nWait, that would be 88572, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nOkay, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nLet me just quickly recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. S1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. S2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. S3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. S4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. S5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. S6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. S7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. S8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. S9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and I didn't see any calculation errors upon reviewing.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.

It seems like each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something, and then that whole thing is multiplied by 3 again. So it's like a chain of these operations. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that part simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). But wait, the innermost was (1 + 3), so the next one out would be (1 + 3*(result from the innermost)). Wait, no, actually, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). So let's go step by step:\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the inside out as levels 1 to 9, perhaps.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2))\n\nAnd so on, until Level 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9).\n\nWait, but let me count how many levels there are.

Correct.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me check how many levels there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each time it's wrapped in another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Level 1\n\n2. 3*(Level 1) inside (1 + ...)\n\nWait, no, each time it's (1 + 3*(...)), so each level adds another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of levels is 9, because each time you go one level out, you add another (1 + 3*(...)), and the original expression has 9 such levels after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Level 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each time you have another (1 + 3(...)), so the number of nested levels is 9, meaning that the innermost is Level 1, and the outermost is Level 9, right?\n\nWait, no, maybe it's better to think that each (1 + 3(...)) is a level, so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Level 1.\n\nThen, the next one out is (1 + 3*(Level1)), that's Level2.\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), which would be Level9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level9).\n\nSo, yes, that's 9 levels, so my calculation of up to Level9 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 levels. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), so let's count the number of ( after the first one:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 levels. So, yes, my calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the levels.\n\nLet me go through each level again:\n\nLevel1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Level5 again: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLevel6: 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel7: 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel8: 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9: 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute it again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given that it's only 9 levels, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 levels, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each level. Let's see.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11:\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=3*59049=177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nThis method is much faster, especially if the number of levels is larger. But since it's only 9 levels, step-by-step computation is feasible.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each level from the innermost outwards, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous term})\\), starting from the innermost term.\n\n2. **Compute Each Level**:\n   - **Level 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Level 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Level 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Level 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Level 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Level 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Level 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Level 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Level 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Level 9}\\), which is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me try to visualize this.\n\nSo, the expression is a series of 3s multiplied by something in parentheses. Each time, inside the parentheses, there's a 1 plus 3 times another set of parentheses. It seems like it's repeating multiple times. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so I need to figure out how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There's one after the first 3, then another inside that, and so on. Wait, actually, each 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another multiplication. Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Then each layer wraps around that with another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, let's see:\n\nStarting from the right, the innermost is (1+3), then each time we go left, we add another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another layer, and so on.\n\nWait, let me write it out step by step to make sure I don't get confused.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, L1: (1 + 3)\n\nThen L2: 3*(1 + L1)\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2)\n\nAnd so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + L8), since there are 9 sets of parentheses in total? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of closing parentheses. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the end: ... (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nWait, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times 3 is multiplied by a term. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Let's see:\n\n1. The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by something. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each layer above that adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, because each (1 + 3(...) adds another parenthesis. Wait, let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), and each of those has another (1 + 3(...)) inside, except the innermost one.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + layer1)\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + layer2)\n\nAnd so on, until layer9? Wait, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of times I see (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, from the innermost, we have 8 more layers? Because each time we go out, it's another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a nested expression with 9 layers, but let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because each (1 + 3(...) adds a new layer, starting from (1 + 3) as layer 1, then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, in total, there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of times the multiplication by 3 occurs. Each time, it's 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, another 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does 3*(...) occur? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied by a term. Let me count the number of 3*(...) instances.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3(...)) which is the first opening parenthesis.\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the last one, which is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, because each layer adds another opening parenthesis, and the innermost is (1 + 3), which doesn't have any more parentheses inside. So, that would mean there are 8 layers? Or 9?\n\nWait, let me think differently. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + layer1), which is layer2.\n\nThen, layer3 is 3*(1 + layer2)\n\nAnd so on, until layer9.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times the pattern (1 + 3(...)) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), and each of those has another (1 + 3(...)) inside, except the innermost one.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + layer1), which is layer2.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + layer2) is layer3.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers do we have?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...) adds another opening parenthesis. So, after the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 8, because each (1 + 3(...) adds one, and the innermost is (1 + 3), which doesn't add any more.\n\nWait, so if there are 8 opening parentheses after the first 3, that would mean there are 8 layers? Or 9?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of layers being equal to the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so if I go through each layer, starting from the innermost, and compute each step, I end up with 36084 as the final result. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer1.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we add another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\nFrom the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each time we go out, it's another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me see: starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 layer1\n\nThen, each layer above that adds another (1 + 3(...)), so:\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + layer1)\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to layer9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), and each of those has another (1 + 3(...)) inside, except the innermost one.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 1 layer.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we add another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 that's one opening parenthesis.\n\nInside that, another (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 that's the second.\n\nAnd so on, until we reach the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 9th opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, no, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is after the 8th opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each (1 + 3(...)) adds a new layer, and the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one layer.\n\nThen, each time we go out, it's another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step, counting the layers.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Let's call that layer1.\n\nThen, moving left, the next layer is 3*(1 + layer1). That's layer2.\n\nThen, moving left again, it's 3*(1 + layer2). That's layer3.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we move left, we add another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers do we have?\n\nLet me count the number of times I can move left, adding a layer each time, until I reach the end of the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer1.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we add another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 1\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 2\n\nAnd so on, until the last one, which is (1 + 3). So, how many opening parentheses are there after the first 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, because each (1 + 3(...) adds one, and the innermost is (1 + 3), which doesn't add any more.\n\nWait, so that would mean there are 8 layers? Or 9?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the number of layers is equal to the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections, which is 9, because each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, no, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is just one, and each time we go out, we add another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer1.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we add another layer.\n\nSo, in total, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me try to parse the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total, from layer1 to layer9.\n\nBut let me check the original expression again to make sure.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer1.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we have another (1 + 3(...)), so layer2, layer3, up to layer9.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see 8 opening parentheses, which would suggest 8 layers. But when I computed up to layer9, I got 36084.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression from the inside out.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen, moving out another layer:\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnother layer:\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nAnother:\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nAnother:\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nAnother:\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nAnother:\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nAnother:\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, no, let me count again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) adds an opening parenthesis.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 1\n\n2. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 2\n\n3. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 3\n\n4. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 4\n\n5. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 5\n\n6. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 6\n\n7. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 7\n\n8. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 8\n\n9. (1 + 3) \u2192 9\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the 9th opening parenthesis. So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each corresponding to an opening parenthesis after the first 3.\n\nSo, that would mean that my initial computation up to layer9 is correct, resulting in 36084.\n\nBut let me verify this by computing each layer step by step, to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting with layer1:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since it's only 9 layers, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at each layer:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 15\n\nLayer3: 48\n\nLayer4: 147\n\nLayer5: 444\n\nLayer6: 1335\n\nLayer7: 4008\n\nLayer8: 12027\n\nLayer9: 36084\n\nWait, let's see if there's a pattern between each layer.\n\nFrom Layer1 to Layer2: 4 to 15. How? 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nFrom Layer2 to Layer3: 15 to 48. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nFrom Layer3 to Layer4: 48 to 147. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWith a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express this as a recurrence and find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nLet me rewrite it as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2:\n\n8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A\n\nThus, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few layers.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n11*19683 = ?\n\nLet me compute 10*19683 = 196830\n\nAdd 19683: 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nWait, no, 19683*10 = 196,830\n\n196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513\n\nWait, 19683*10 = 196,830\n\n196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513\n\nSo, 11*19683 = 216,513\n\nNow, subtract 9:\n\n216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n216,504 / 6\n\nDivide 216,504 by 6:\n\n6*36,000 = 216,000\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504\n\n504 /6 = 84\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084\n\nThus, a_9 = 36,084\n\nSo, the final result is 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive structure where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, let me look again.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3(1 + 3(...)). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So perhaps I should consider each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, looking at the original problem, there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3( result from 1 )\n3. 1 + 3( result from 2 )\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until we have nine layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of 1 + 3 inside each other.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this as a repeated multiplication and addition. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each nested expression as follows:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(E9). So the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to miscalculate with so many layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I did E9, I thought E9 was 29,524, so 3*29,524 is 88,572. But let me check the E9 calculation again because when I computed E9 as 1 + 3*9841, which is 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the E calculations.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, E9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, if there are nine layers, that would mean E1 to E9, each time adding a layer. So, I think my calculation is correct with nine layers.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 1 + 3 expressions inside each other. Let me write it out:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to nine layers. So, yes, E1 to E9, each time adding another layer. So, E9 is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, E9 = 29,524, then 3*E9 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be error-prone.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form E_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = E_n^{(h)} + E_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n\n9/2 = 3*C\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: E2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: E3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: E4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: E5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: E6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: E7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: E8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, E9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for E_n, we can compute the entire expression directly.\n\nSince the entire expression is 3*E9, and E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then:\n\nEntire expression = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so:\n\nEntire expression = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using the formula approach.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it sufficiently, so I'm confident in this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let me see if I can figure this out. \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times something. So it's like a chain of 1 + 3*(...), and each time, the inside is another similar expression. Let me try to count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). \n\nWait, maybe I should start from the inside and work my way out. That seems logical because each layer depends on the one inside it. So, let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as E1:\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, the next layer out is E2:\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nThen, E3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, until we get to the outermost layer, which would be E9, I think. Wait, let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original problem: \n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1+3\nThen, each time, it's 1+3*(...), so each layer adds one more. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, there's a 3*(...), and each ... is another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to just start computing from the inside.\n\nStarting with E1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E2: 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9: 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(E9), so that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(E9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check each step again because sometimes when you do multiple steps, you might make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting with E1 to E9:\n\nE1: 1+3=4\n\nE2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nE3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nE4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nE5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nE6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nE7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nE8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nE9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of times the expression is nested.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...), and each time, it's wrapped in another 3*(...). Let's see how many layers there are.\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, the first layer is (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of times the pattern (1 + 3(...) occurs:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers?\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet me write down the expression without the initial 3:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nNow, let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 1 + 3, each ( starts a new layer.\n\nSo, the first ( starts E1, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 E1\n2. Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial (1 + 3, there are 8 more (1 + 3(...) layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial ( is the first, then each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. (1 + 3( \u2192 E1\n2. (1 + 3( \u2192 E2\n3. (1 + 3( \u2192 E3\n4. (1 + 3( \u2192 E4\n5. (1 + 3( \u2192 E5\n6. (1 + 3( \u2192 E6\n7. (1 + 3( \u2192 E7\n8. (1 + 3( \u2192 E8\n9. (1 + 3) \u2192 E9\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. But in my earlier calculation, I went up to E9, which was 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me check: when I started, I thought the innermost was E1, then each layer adds another, so with 9 layers, E9 would be the innermost? Wait, no, perhaps I have the layers reversed.\n\nWait, no, in my earlier approach, I started from the innermost as E1, then each subsequent E is one layer out. So, if there are 9 layers, then E9 would be the outermost expression, but in the problem, the outermost is multiplied by 3. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(E), where E is a nested expression with 8 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), because each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), and each of those has another layer inside. So perhaps the number of layers is 8, not 9.\n\nWait, maybe I should recount the number of layers.\n\nLet me count the number of times the pattern (1 + 3*(...)) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is E1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nSo, the layers are:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, starting from E1 as the innermost.\n\nBut in the original problem, the expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had E9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), and how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, each ( starts a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3( \u2192 first layer\n2. (1 + 3( \u2192 second layer\n3. (1 + 3( \u2192 third layer\n4. (1 + 3( \u2192 fourth layer\n5. (1 + 3( \u2192 fifth layer\n6. (1 + 3( \u2192 sixth layer\n7. (1 + 3( \u2192 seventh layer\n8. (1 + 3( \u2192 eighth layer\n9. (1 + 3) \u2192 ninth layer\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers in total, each corresponding to E1 to E9.\n\nSo, E1 is the innermost, E9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, when I computed E9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the E calculations.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount.\n\nIn the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around it with another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...) starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1 + 3*(layer1)) \u2192 layer2\n3. (1 + 3*(layer2)) \u2192 layer3\n4. (1 + 3*(layer3)) \u2192 layer4\n5. (1 + 3*(layer4)) \u2192 layer5\n6. (1 + 3*(layer5)) \u2192 layer6\n7. (1 + 3*(layer6)) \u2192 layer7\n8. (1 + 3*(layer7)) \u2192 layer8\n9. (1 + 3*(layer8)) \u2192 layer9\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, which correspond to E1 to E9 as I calculated before.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*(E9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think.\n\nThis kind of expression is a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nWith E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation: E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0\n\nCharacteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 \u2192 r=3\n\nSo, homogeneous solution: E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume E_n^{(p)} = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition E1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, E1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nE1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nE2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nE3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nE4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nIn our problem, we have E9, so n=9.\n\nE9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we also arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way out.

Next layer: 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nMoving out another level, we have 1 + 3*364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext up, the expression is 1 + 3*1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, we now have 1 + 3*3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer is 1 + 3*9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from the last step).\n\n10. Outermost layer: 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute that. 3*29524.\n\nHmm, let me do this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I should write it out more carefully.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nSo:\n\n- Units place: 4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, it's 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems to check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nI think that's it. It was a bit tedious with all the nested expressions, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. Each time, I just computed the innermost expression, substituted it into the next layer, and so on until I reached the outermost multiplication by 3. No step seemed too complicated once I took it one at a time. I was a bit worried about making a multiplication error, especially with larger numbers, but breaking it down digit by digit helped prevent mistakes. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Continue outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Continue outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Continue outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. It seems like each part inside the parentheses is similar, so maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, let me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly. The innermost part is 1+3, right? Then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by something. Let me see if I can express this as a series of steps.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3\n2. Then, take that result, multiply by 3, and add 1.\n3. Repeat this process, moving outward each time.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, each step is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous step. That makes sense. So, it's a recursive kind of structure where each term depends on the one before it.\n\nLet me try to write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer. Wait, actually, counting the layers, I see that there are 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Continuing this way until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, actually, the problem has 9 sets of 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Hmm, from the expression, each opening parenthesis has a 3 multiplied by it. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me try to parse this expression step by step. Maybe I can write each step as S_n, where n is the step number, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define S_1 as the innermost expression:\n\nS_1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving outward, S_2 would be:\n\nS_2 = 1 + 3*S_1\n\nSimilarly, S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2\n\nAnd this continues until S_9, which would be the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but looking at the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))). So, the entire expression is 3*(S_9), where S_9 is 1 + 3*(S_8), and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps I should compute S_1 to S_9 step by step.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\n1. Compute S_1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute S_2: 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Compute S_3: 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Compute S_4: 1 + 3*S_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Compute S_5: 1 + 3*S_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Compute S_6: 1 + 3*S_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Compute S_7: 1 + 3*S_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Compute S_8: 1 + 3*S_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Compute S_9: 1 + 3*S_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(S_9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the S_1 to S_9 computations.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nS_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each step manually, just to verify.\n\nWait, each S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form is S_n = a*S_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is S_n = a^n * (S_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where S_0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, but in our case, S_1 = 4, so maybe we need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute S_n as S_n = 3^n + (something). Let me think.\n\nWait, if we consider S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4.\n\nThen, S_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nS_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nHmm, let's see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute S_n in terms of S_1.\n\nEach step, S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nSo, S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1\n\nS_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*S_1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*S_1\n\nS_4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2*S_1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*S_1\n\nSo, in general, S_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k} + 3^{n} * S_1\n\nWait, because each time we expand, we get another term multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me test this for n=2:\n\nS_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nAccording to the formula, sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k} + 3^{2}*4 = (1 + 3) + 9*4 = 4 + 36 = 40. Wait, that's not matching S_2 which is 13. Hmm, maybe my generalization is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is S_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n} * S_1\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: S_1=4, which is (3^1 -1)/2 + 3^1*4 = (3-1)/2 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13, which is S_2, not S_1. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of S_n as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me try to express S_n as S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is S_n - 3*S_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution S_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say S_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: S_p - 3*S_p = 1 => -2*S_p = 1 => S_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's take n=1, S_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: S_1 should be 4.\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, S_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression, but since I already have the answer through step-by-step computation and verified with the recurrence relation, I think it's solid.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12\n\n= 60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost part and work our way outward.

It seems like each part is similar, just repeated with more layers. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that part is simple enough.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I parse this correctly. The next layer is 1 + 3(...). So, substituting the innermost part, it becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, hold on, no. Let me look again. The structure is 3(1 + 3(...)). So each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times the next layer). So actually, each step is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, maybe I should write this out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let's count how many layers there are. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the problem again, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times the next inner expression). So, perhaps I should start by computing the innermost expression first, then substitute it into the next layer, and so on.\n\nLet me try to map this out step by step.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 to 9, maybe? Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to count the number of layers.

Because each time, it's another layer of 1 + 3(...). Let me check: the problem has 9 sets of parentheses starting from the innermost. So, there are 9 layers.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, then multiply the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer).

So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the problem, each layer is multiplied by 3 on the outside. Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost expression, we work outward, but each step is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each layer being 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). Let me try again.\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next inner layer)).\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that each layer is 1 + 3*(next inner layer), except the outermost, which is 3*(...).\n\nLet me try to parse this correctly.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*(L1)\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(L2)\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(L8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9)\n\nSo, in this case, I can compute each L from L1 to L9 step by step.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nCompute L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nCompute L2:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nCompute L3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nCompute L4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nCompute L5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nCompute L6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nCompute L7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nCompute L8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nCompute L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\n1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but let me just check 3 * 29524 another way to make sure.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each step built upon the previous one, and by carefully computing each layer from the inside out, I arrived at the correct result. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it step by step helps prevent mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with the innermost (1 + 3) and moving outward, multiplying each result by 3 as needed.

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested expressions. Let me try to parse this. It seems like a series of 3s multiplied by expressions inside parentheses. Each expression is 1 plus 3 times another expression, and this repeats several times. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nLet me rewrite the problem to make it clearer. Starting from the inside, the innermost part is:\n\n1 + 3\n\nSo, let's compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nAlright, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, but we just computed that 1 + 3 is 4, so substituting that in, we get:\n\n1 + 3(4)\n\nNow, 3 times 4 is 12, so:\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Let me note that down.\n\nNext layer out, we have:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nBut we've already computed the innermost part, which was 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3(4) = 13. So, substituting that into the next layer:\n\n1 + 3(13)\n\nCalculating 3 times 13 gives 39, so:\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, that's the next step. So, this layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nBut from the previous step, we know that 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) is 40. So substituting that in:\n\n1 + 3(40)\n\n3 times 40 is 120, so:\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, so that's 121. Let me keep going.\n\nNext layer:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nWe've just computed that 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) is 121. So substituting that in:\n\n1 + 3(121)\n\nCalculating 3 times 121 gives 363, so:\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nAlright, moving on to the next layer:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n\nWe found that 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) is 364. So substituting:\n\n1 + 3(364)\n\n3 times 364 is... let me compute that. 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So:\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nOkay, that's 1093. Next layer:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWe just calculated that the inner part is 1093, so substituting:\n\n1 + 3(1093)\n\n3 times 1093: Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So:\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nAlright, moving out another layer:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWe just found that the inner expression is 3280. So substituting:\n\n1 + 3(3280)\n\n3 times 3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So:\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check the multiplication: 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Yes, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then plus 1 is 9841. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWe just calculated that inner expression as 9841. So substituting:\n\n1 + 3(9841)\n\n3 times 9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So:\n\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nAlright, that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWe just found that the inner part is 29524. So substituting:\n\n1 + 3(29524)\n\n3 times 29524: Let's compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. So:\n\n1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nOkay, so that innermost expression simplifies to 88573. Now, the entire original problem is 3 multiplied by this expression. So:\n\n3 * 88573\n\nLet me compute that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240000+24000=264000, 264000+1500=265500, 265500+210=265710, 265710+9=265719.\n\nWait, let me check that again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, I can compute 88573 * 3:\n\n80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 * 3 = 24,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n70 * 3 = 210\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nAdding all together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 times 88,573 is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to ensure I didn't miscalculate any of the intermediate steps. Let me go through the layers again to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nFinally, 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds upon the previous one, and the calculations check out. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would work here. The expression is of the form:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))))\n\nThis looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let's see how many terms there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(previous term) +1. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nLooking back at the original problem, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n10. Finally: 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, actually, the original problem has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nAnd then the outermost 3 multiplied by that. So, there are 9 layers inside the final multiplication.\n\nIf I think of this as a geometric series, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where n starts from 1.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to a_9 being 29524, and then the outermost was 3*(a_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 88573). So, actually, the original expression is 3*a_10, where a_10 = 88573.\n\nBut in terms of a geometric series, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have a_10, which is:\n\na_10 = (3^{11} -1)/2.\n\nBecause n=10, so a_10 = (3^{11} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, a_10 = (177147 -1)/2 =177146/2=88573.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_10 =3*88573=265,719.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it more quickly without manually computing each layer. That's pretty efficient.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_10 = (177147 -1)/2=88573.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_10=265,719.\n\nSo, both methods agree, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've verified it enough. The answer should be 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By simplifying step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be modeled by a geometric series. Using the recurrence relation and solving the series, we determine the value of the expression.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated multiple times. Starting from the innermost layer, each term is built by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Start with the innermost term: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Continue this process outward, each time substituting the result of the inner layer into the next.\n\n3. **Recognize the Pattern:**\n   Each term follows the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation.\n\n4. **Solve the Recurrence:**\n   - The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n   - The particular solution is found to be -1/2.\n   - Combining both, the general solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n5. **Apply the Formula:**\n   - For the 10th term (a_10), compute a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 88573.\n   - Multiply by 3 as per the original problem: 3 * 88573 = 265,719.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually seems to work with these kinds of problems.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last (1+3). So, let me write that down.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. Compute (1 + 3). That should be straightforward.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 equals 4. Got that. Now, moving one level out, we have another 3 multiplied by this result. Let me write that next.\n\n2. Compute 3*(result from step 1). So, 3 * 4.\n\n3 * 4 is 12. Okay, so that gives me 12. Now, moving another level out, we have another (1 + result from step 2). Let me compute that.\n\n3. Compute (1 + result from step 2). So, 1 + 12.\n\n1 + 12 is 13. Moving on, the next level out is another multiplication by 3.\n\n4. Compute 3*(result from step 3). So, 3 * 13.\n\n3 * 13 is 39. Alright, moving another level out, we have another (1 + result from step 4).\n\n5. Compute (1 + result from step 4). So, 1 + 39.\n\n1 + 39 is 40. Next, multiply by 3 again.\n\n6. Compute 3*(result from step 5). So, 3 * 40.\n\n3 * 40 is 120. Moving out another level, we have (1 + result from step 6).\n\n7. Compute (1 + result from step 6). So, 1 + 120.\n\n1 + 120 is 121. Next, multiply by 3.\n\n8. Compute 3*(result from step 7). So, 3 * 121.\n\n3 * 121 is... let me compute that. 120 * 3 is 360, and 1 * 3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Got it.\n\n9. Now, moving another level out, compute (1 + result from step 8). So, 1 + 363.\n\n1 + 363 is 364. Multiply by 3 again.\n\n10. Compute 3*(result from step 9). So, 3 * 364.\n\nHmm, 364 * 3. Let me break that down. 300 * 3 is 900, 60 * 3 is 180, and 4 * 3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3 * 364 is 1092.\n\n11. Next level out, compute (1 + result from step 10). So, 1 + 1092.\n\n1 + 1092 is 1093. Multiply by 3 again.\n\n12. Compute 3*(result from step 11). So, 3 * 1093.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1000 * 3 is 3000, 90 * 3 is 270, and 3 * 3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3 * 1093 is 3279.\n\n13. Now, moving another level out, compute (1 + result from step 12). So, 1 + 3279.\n\n1 + 3279 is 3280. Multiply by 3 again.\n\n14. Compute 3*(result from step 13). So, 3 * 3280.\n\nCalculating that, 3000 * 3 is 9000, 200 * 3 is 600, 80 * 3 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3 * 3280 is 9840.\n\n15. Next, moving another level out, compute (1 + result from step 14). So, 1 + 9840.\n\n1 + 9840 is 9841. Multiply by 3 again.\n\n16. Compute 3*(result from step 15). So, 3 * 9841.\n\nLet me compute this step by step. 9000 * 3 is 27000, 800 * 3 is 2400, 40 * 3 is 120, and 1 * 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3 * 9841 is 29523.\n\n17. Finally, moving to the outermost level, compute (1 + result from step 16). So, 1 + 29523.\n\n1 + 29523 is 29524. Now, multiply this by 3.\n\n18. Compute 3*(result from step 17). So, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me calculate that. 20000 * 3 is 60000, 9000 * 3 is 27000, 500 * 3 is 1500, 20 * 3 is 60, 4 * 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because that number seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go back and check each step. Starting from step 1:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 3 * 4 = 12 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. (1 + 12) = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 3 * 13 = 39 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. (1 + 39) = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 3 * 40 = 120 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. (1 + 120) = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 3 * 121 = 363 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. (1 + 363) = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3 * 364 = 1092 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n11. (1 + 1092) = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n12. 3 * 1093 = 3279 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n13. (1 + 3279) = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n14. 3 * 3280 = 9840 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n15. (1 + 9840) = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n16. 3 * 9841 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n17. (1 + 29523) = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n18. 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps check out. So, the final result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of multiplications and additions. Each step seems to be of the form 3*(1 + previous result). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each term as a_n, where n is the number of times we've applied the operation. Starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Wait, but earlier I had a different result. Wait, no, actually, in my earlier steps, I started from the innermost and worked outward, so perhaps my indexing is different.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as a recurrence relation where each step is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from some initial value.\n\nBut in the problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, perhaps the sequence is:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with my earlier step-by-step computation. Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, in the problem, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3(...) parts: Let's see, starting from the innermost, each time we have 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the 3s.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to count the number of 3s before the innermost (1 + 3). Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s before the innermost (1+3). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(...), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on. So, the structure is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is Layer 9: 3(1 + 3). Then, each layer wraps around that. So, the total number of layers is 9. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me count the number of times 3(1 + ... occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and the number of times this repeats is 8 times, because from the innermost (1 + 3) up to the outermost, there are 9 layers, but the multiplication by 3 occurs 9 times? Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each time you have a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, if I have n layers, then the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with n layers. Let me see how many layers there are in the problem.\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of 3s after the first is 8. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Let me see:\n\nAfter the initial 3, each subsequent layer starts with 3. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer is another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the first. The first is the outermost 3, then each inner layer adds another 3. So, how many 3s are there in total? Let's see:\n\nFrom the expression, after the first 3, each inner part is another 3. So, the number of 3s is 9: the outermost 3, and then 8 more inside. So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 18 steps, which seems too much. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the steps. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer corresponds to a step where I compute 3*(1 + previous result). So, if there are 9 layers, then I should have 9 steps of multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 18 steps, which seems incorrect. Let me try again, perhaps more carefully.\n\nLet me try to model this as a recurrence relation with a base case. Let's define a_n as the value after n layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 through a_9.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so according to this, a_9 is 36,084. But earlier, when I computed step by step, I ended up with 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nLet me check where I went wrong. In the first approach, I started from the innermost and worked outward, computing each step, but perhaps I miscounted the number of layers or the operations.\n\nWait, in the expression, how many times does the 3*(1 + ... ) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the first one. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then, inside that, another 3(...), and so on.\n\nSo, how many times does 3(1 + ... ) occur? Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, the next is 3(...), then another 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 3s after the first. It seems like there are 8 more 3s, making a total of 9 layers. So, a_9 would be the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but according to the recurrence, a_9 is 36,084, whereas my initial step-by-step gave me 88,572. So, there must be a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial step-by-step approach was wrong because I didn't correctly map the layers. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the number of layers. Let me try to write down the expression with indices to see how many layers there are.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, according to this, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 36,084. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36,084.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 88,572, which is much larger. So, clearly, I must have miscounted the layers or the operations in the first approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original problem again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times 3(1 + ... ) appears.\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 3(1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3(1 + ... ). So, how many times does this occur?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), which itself contains another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nEach time we have a 3 followed by a (1 + ...). So, the number of such occurrences is 9. Because starting from the first 3, each inner layer adds another 3(...). Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, if there are 9 layers, then the outermost would be a_9 = 36,084.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I went through 18 steps, which suggests that I was considering each addition and multiplication as a separate step, but perhaps I was miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nFirst, let's write down the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nC - 3*C = 3\n\n-2C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1.5\n\n3A = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5\n\nA = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplifying, since 3^n is 3*3^{n-1}, we can write:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, factor out 3:\n\na_n = 3*(11/6)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to leave it as a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nCompute 3280.5 * 10 = 32,805\n\nPlus 3280.5 = 32,805 + 3,280.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the recurrence approach. Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I got 88,572. That must mean I made a mistake in that approach. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nLooking back, in my initial step-by-step, I started from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then multiplied by 3 to get 12, then added 1 to get 13, multiplied by 3 to get 39, and so on. But perhaps I miscounted the number of layers, leading to an incorrect final result.\n\nWait, if the correct answer is 36,084, then my initial step-by-step approach must have incorrectly accounted for the number of layers. Let me try to recount the layers properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ... ), so the final result is a_9 = 36,084.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 88,572, which is exactly 36,084 * 2.45, which doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps I was counting the layers incorrectly, adding an extra layer somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has more layers than I thought. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the initial 3:\n\nEach time, after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer.\n- Inside that, another 3(...), so that's the second layer.\n- Continuing this way, how many times does 3(1 + ... ) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Each 3 is followed by a (, so let's count the number of ( after each 3.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to note that the expression has 9 instances of 3 followed by (1 + ... ). So, the number of layers is 9, leading to a_9 = 36,084.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step approach by miscalculating the number of layers, leading to an incorrect final result.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me try to compute this using the recurrence relation step-by-step to ensure that I get 36,084.\n\nCompute a_1 through a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the correct answer is 36,084.\n\nTherefore, my initial step-by-step approach must have had an error in the number of layers or operations, leading to the incorrect 88,572. By using the recurrence relation and carefully counting the layers, I arrive at 36,084 as the correct answer.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the final answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is of the form \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + \\dots)))\\), which repeats 9 times.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value after \\(n\\) layers.

It seems like there are multiple layers of 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, it's like a chain of operations where each step is 3 times (1 plus another similar expression). \n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting confused. Let me write down the structure to visualize it better.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 is 4. \n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next part is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 4 = 12.\n\nNext layer out, we have (1 + the result from the previous step). So, 1 + 12.\n\n1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, moving another layer out, we multiply that by 3.\n\n3 * 13 = 39.\n\nMoving out another layer, we add 1 to that result.\n\n1 + 39 = 40.\n\nMultiply by 3 again.\n\n3 * 40 = 120.\n\nAdd 1 again.\n\n1 + 120 = 121.\n\nMultiply by 3.\n\n3 * 121 = 363.\n\nAdd 1.\n\n1 + 363 = 364.\n\nMultiply by 3.\n\n3 * 364 = 1092.\n\nAdd 1.\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nMultiply by 3.\n\n3 * 1093 = 3279.\n\nWait, let me check how many layers I have. I think I might have miscounted. Let me recount the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers I need to compute.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\" sequences, I think there are nine instances of (1+3(...). Wait, actually, let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses. Each time, a 3 is multiplied by a (1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s:\n\nFrom the innermost, it's (1+3), then 3*(1+3), then 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)), and so on. Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 3*(1+3) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. But let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Each time, I'm adding 1 to the previous result and multiplying by 3. Let me list each step clearly:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, now I'm getting a different result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let me try again more carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me write down each step methodically.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine layers? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \n   - Inside the first parentheses: 1+3(...)\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1+3). So, the number of layers is 9? Let me count the number of \"3(\" after each other.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times 3 is used as a multiplier.\n\nLet me parse it as follows:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because when I first did it, I thought it was 29,523, but that was a miscalculation. Let me redo each step carefully:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12,027\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, after each step, I'm adding 1 to the previous result and multiplying by 3. So, each step is:\n\ncurrent = 3*(1 + previous)\n\nStarting from 4, then 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12,027, and finally 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me check step 9 again. 1 + 12,027 is 12,028. Multiply by 3: 12,028 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 12,028 * 3:\n\n12,000 * 3 = 36,000\n\n28 * 3 = 84\n\nSo, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 36,084.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of times I added 1 and multiplied by 3. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4 (this is the innermost, not counted as a layer yet)\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 (1st layer)\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 (2nd layer)\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 (3rd layer)\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 (4th layer)\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 (5th layer)\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 (6th layer)\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12,027 (7th layer)\n9. 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084 (8th layer)\n\nWait, so that's only 8 layers? Or is the innermost (1+3) considered the first layer?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the innermost (1+3) is counted as the first step or not. Let me clarify:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of 3*(1 + ...) operations is 8, because the innermost is just (1+3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + (1+3)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n- Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n- Then, 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n- Then, 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n- Then, 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n- Then, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n- Then, 3*(1 + 4008) = 12,027\n- Then, 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084\n\nSo, that's 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost (1+3). So, the total number of 3*(1 + ...) is 8, with the innermost being (1+3). So, the total layers are 8, leading to 36,084 as the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nEach step is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 layers, but if I denote a_1 as the innermost, then a_9 would be the outermost. Let me try that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12,027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084\n\nSo, if I consider a_1 as the innermost, then a_9 is the outermost result, which is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) = 3A - 3/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nA = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*(3^n)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2\n\nBut let me compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (11*3^9)/6 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19,683)/6 - 3/2\n\nCompute 11*19,683:\n\n11*19,683 = ?\n\nLet me compute 10*19,683 = 196,830\n\nAdd 19,683: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513\n\nSo, a_9 = 216,513 / 6 - 3/2\n\nCompute 216,513 / 6:\n\nDivide 216,513 by 6:\n\n6*36,085 = 216,510\n\nSo, 216,513 - 216,510 = 3\n\nThus, 216,513 / 6 = 36,085 + 3/6 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 = 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches our earlier result. So, using the closed-form formula, we also get 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 3 times (1 plus the previous result). After calculating each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 36,084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions like this.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer, maybe by numbering the parentheses or something. But actually, since they're all similar, I can probably compute each innermost part one by one.\n\nLet me count how many sets of parentheses there are.

Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nLet me list the layers from innermost to outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Layer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, I think I might have gone one step too far. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), how many layers do we have?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), so that's one layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count how many times we have 1+3*(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which would be 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, I think there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). Let me verify that.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, from layer 1 to layer 9, and then the outermost is 3*(layer 9). So, the total number of layers is 10, but the outermost is just multiplied by 3, not another 1+3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, carefully.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost parentheses and work my way out.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Now, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, so step 10 is the outermost layer, which is 3 multiplied by the result from step 9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches what I had before.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step.\n\nLet me go through each layer again, just to be thorough.\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Layer 10: 3*(29524) = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from (1+3), which is 4, then each time we compute 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, we get to 29,524, and then the outermost is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given the small number of layers (only 9 layers inside), computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied to compute this more efficiently, just to confirm.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, we have:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, this recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n-1} + B,\n\nwhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence:\n\na_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n\n\nAssume solution a_n = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nThen,\n\na_{n+1} = A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo,\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen,\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{0} + B = A + B = 4\n\nWe know B = -1/2, so:\n\nA - 1/2 = 4 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, (9/2)*3^{n-1} is equal to (3^2/2)*3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2.\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's usually best to start from the innermost parentheses and work your way outward. So, let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make it a bit clearer. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost part:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...), so let me count the number of 3s. Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: I can see 9 opening parentheses, so that means 9 layers? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a parenthesis. Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(previous)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(previous)\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, each time we have another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the opening parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, but maybe I can work it out step by step.\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result). So:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but let's continue.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result). So, that would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3: Let's compute step by step.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524\n*         3\n----------\n88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. I started from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. Let me make sure that the number of layers is correct.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\nEach time, after 3, there's an opening parenthesis, so let's count them:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, then another 3 followed by another opening parenthesis, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, each \"3(\" is a new layer, so how many times does \"3(\" occur?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, that would mean 9 layers, each being 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1, then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9, then the outermost 3*(Layer9). So, my calculation earlier was correct with 9 layers, resulting in 29524, then 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me recast the problem as a recursive function, maybe, to see if I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me define each layer as a function f(n), where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, f(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for f(n). Since f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 +1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that works too.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recursive formula, finding the closed-form expression, and verifying the arithmetic. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 3(1 + previous result). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a closed-form formula, we find the result to be 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous result):\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3.

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let me try to parse this. It seems like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. That makes sense because if I try to compute it from the outside in, I might get lost in the parentheses.\n\nLet me write down the expression more clearly, maybe numbering each layer to keep track. So, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 is 4. That seems straightforward.\n\n2. Next layer out is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). Since step 1 gave me 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13.\n\n3. The next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). Step 2 was 13, so this is 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40.\n\n4. Moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 3)). Step 3 was 40, so this becomes 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121.\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 4)). Step 4 was 121, so 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364.\n\n6. Continuing outward: (1 + 3*(result from step 5)). Step 5 was 364, so 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364, let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 6)). Step 6 was 1093, so 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n8. Moving outward: (1 + 3*(result from step 7)). Step 7 was 3280, so 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 8)). Step 8 was 9841, so 1 + 3*9841.\n\nHmm, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9). Step 9 was 29524, so 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 times 29524. Let me do it another way.\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step built upon the previous one, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each time, I computed the inner expression first, multiplied by 3, added 1, and then used that result for the next layer. Finally, after computing all layers, I ended up with 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error.\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step was computed accurately, and the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Use the result from step 2 to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Use the result from step 3 to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Use the result from step 4 to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Use the result from step 5 to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Use the result from step 6 to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Use the result from step 7 to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Use the result from step 8 to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
