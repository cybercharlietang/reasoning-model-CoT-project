Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I think in terms of the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

    "text": " => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, but in our earlier computation, layer 1 was 4, which is (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. Similarly, layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13, which matches. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that confirms our earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see if this is a geometric series. Let me think about it. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the expression, it's similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, actually, when you expand the entire expression, it's a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*(3 +1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0? Wait, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, 3^0=1. 9 + 3 +1=13. Yes, that's correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. But 3^3=27, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, 3^0=1. 27 +9 +3 +1=40. Yes, so Layer3 is 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0 =40. Similarly, Layer4: 1 +3*(Layer3)=1 + 3*40=121. Which is 3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0=81+27+9+3+1=121. So, each layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. That is, a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n. The sum of such a series is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. So, indeed, each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I think about expanding the entire original expression without substituting layers, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which, when fully expanded, would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times that. If I expand all the parentheses, it's equivalent to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))), which, as we saw, is a geometric series. So, the total sum inside the outermost 3 is the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, that's another way to think about it, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using exponentiation by squaring or another method, but given that 3^10 is manageable, it's straightforward. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression, leading to a closed-form solution. Multiplying the outermost result by 3 gives the final answer. Therefore, after computing each layer and verifying through multiple methods\u2014step-by-step computation, recognizing the recurrence relation, and identifying the geometric series\u2014we arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and each step checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. The innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).

Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.
