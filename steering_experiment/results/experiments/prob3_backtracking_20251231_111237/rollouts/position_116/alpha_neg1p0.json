So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer n has value a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had used the formula for a_n, I could have computed a_9 directly without computing each layer. But since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step isn't too bad. However, if there were more layers, the formula would be more efficient. But in this case, either method works. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. Good, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit. 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524*3 can be computed as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, let me check: 30000*3=90000, 476*3=1428, so 90000 - 1428=88572. Correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems consistent.

So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Then, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. Similarly, n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. No mistakes noticed in the computations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula confirms the result. Alternatively, if I didn't see the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But in any case, computing each layer step by step works as well.
