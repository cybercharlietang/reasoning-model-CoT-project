    "text": " Alternatively, let's see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches our earlier computation. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier result. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct.

The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can solve for the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. So, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. Then the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, to find L_n, we can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also leads to the same result, which is reassuring.

So, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.

Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've considered it thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

It's a recursive expression. Let me denote E(n) as the expression with n layers. Then, E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for E(n). The recurrence is E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 1, with E(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say E_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition E(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n = 9 layers, E(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, E(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.

The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = D. Plugging into the equation: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147.

So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

So, if I denote L_k as the value at layer k, then L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since n is small, computing each step is feasible. Alternatively, for a recurrence relation of the form L_k = a + b*L_{k-1}, the solution is L_k = a*(b^{k} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, but I might be misremembering. Let me check: The homogeneous solution and particular solution. For the recurrence L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_k^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, say at k=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For k=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, let's see: If we define a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, etc. So the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_0 = 1: a_0 = A*3^0 + B = A + B = 1. Since B = -1/2, then A - 1/2 = 1 => A = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since our layers go up to Layer 9, which is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_k as the value at layer k, then L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc., as I computed before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value at the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, we look for a particular solution, a_n^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Let's test for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but in our case, a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps the initial term is different. Let me see. The standard form for a recurrence like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + c. In our case, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 3a_p + 1 => a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier terms. For k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to write the entire expression in terms of exponents, I could note that each layer adds a power of 3. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, computing step by step is straightforward. I think I've confirmed it sufficiently. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is straightforward. However, for practice, let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me plug n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have computed a_9 directly without computing each layer.

It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.

That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar. Let me check. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s. Here, r=3, s=1. The solution is a_n = (s/(r-1)) * (r^{n} - 1). So in this case, s=1, r=3, so a_n = (1/(3-1))*(3^{n} - 1) = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed. For Layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But wait, in our computation, Layer 1 was 4. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps the indexing is different. Wait, in my earlier computation, Layer 1 was 1 + 3 = 4, which would correspond to a_1 = 4. But according to the formula, a_1 would be (3^1 -1)/2 = 1, which doesn't match. Maybe the formula is for a different starting point. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for when the recurrence starts with a_0. Let me think. Let me define a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches Layer 1. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches Layer 2. So in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_0 = 1. Then, the general solution would be a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test that. For a_0: n=0, (3^{1} -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, correct. a_1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. a_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct. a_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, which matches Layer 3.

Since each term is a linear function of the previous term, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the recurrence relation and the formula for a_n. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as 3 times a sum where each term is 3 raised to a certain power, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). So, if I expand it, it's 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3)) + 3*3*3*(1 + ...) + ... up to 9 layers. Hmm, maybe not the easiest way, but perhaps another approach. Alternatively, since each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it, using exponents. That's a much quicker way once you recognize the pattern. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the answer 88572.

The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct solution. I think I'm done here. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a formula to compute it more efficiently.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final value before the outermost multiplication is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " I don't think there's a shortcut formula here because each layer depends on the previous one, but if I had to generalize, maybe I could express it recursively. Let me see: Let\u2019s define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the total expression would be 3*f(9). So, computing f(9) and then multiplying by 3. Let me compute f(n) up to n=9: f(1) = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.

    "text": " Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting with L_1 = 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, L_3=1+3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I did. So, this recursive approach is consistent. Alternatively, this can be represented as a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1 =4. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The general solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + b*(a^{n}-1)/(a-1). In this case, a=3, b=1. So, L_n = 3^{n} * L_0 + (3^{n} -1)/(3-1). But in our case, L_1 =4. So, let's see: If n=1, L_1 =4. Using the formula, L_1 = 3^{1} * L_0 + (3^{1}-1)/2. So, 4 =3*L_0 + (3-1)/2 =3L_0 +1. Therefore, 3L_0 =3, so L_0=1. So, the general formula would be L_n =3^{n}*1 + (3^{n}-1)/2 = (3^{n+1} +3^{n} -1)/2? Wait, that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as L_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Let me test for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, but L_1=4, so that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the general solution. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = 2*3^{n} -1. Let's test: For n=1, 2*3^1 -1=6-1=5\u22604. Hmm, not matching. Wait, let me try to solve the recurrence properly. The recurrence is L_n =3L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)}=A. Plugging into the recurrence: A=3A +1 \u21d2 A-3A=1 \u21d2 -2A=1 \u21d2 A=-1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d24=3C -1/2 \u21d23C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2C=(9/2)/3=3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this: For n=1, L_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula is L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer.
