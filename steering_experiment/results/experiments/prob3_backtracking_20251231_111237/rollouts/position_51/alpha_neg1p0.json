    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So, putting it all together: 7 7 8 7 2 4? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n\nSo, writing it out: 7 (from the ten thousands place), then 7 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 7 (units), and 2 (hundreds place? Wait, no, let me arrange the digits correctly.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten thousands place is 8\n\nWait, that gives me 8 8 5 7 2, but that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000. Wait, 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572. Let me verify:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 (from the ten thousands place), then 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572. Okay, that makes sense because 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, so 29,524 * 3 should be a bit less than that, which 88,572 is.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29,524. Then multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. So, is that the final answer? Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Specifically, it's a linear recurrence of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that such linear recursions can be solved using the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nGiven that, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's about it. I've computed each layer, checked my work, and even found a formula to represent the layers, which confirmed my step-by-step calculation. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, eventually leading to the outermost layer being 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.

Wait, let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's a geometric series of sorts. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without having to compute each layer manually. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation give me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10 or something. Let me see. Since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and verify the result, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is a linear function of the previous term. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, to find a_9, I can compute each term up to a_9, which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. For example, each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. The formula I derived above is essentially the sum of a geometric series.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or find a closed-form formula, the result is the same. So, I'm pretty sure that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost term is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the ninth layer to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but it's nested multiple times. Alternatively, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. But since each layer is similar, maybe there's a recursive way to compute it, but since I've already computed each layer step by step, perhaps that's the simplest approach. Alternatively, I could notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524.

Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when you carry over, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let's recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the number of layers isn't too large (nine layers), computing each step by step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression. Let me recall the method for solving such recurrence relations.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A \u2192 9/2 = 3A \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches.\n\nSo, this formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach confirms our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might have been another approach, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more of a linear recurrence than a simple geometric series.\n\nAnother way to think about it is unfolding the expression step by step, which is what I did initially. It's a straightforward, albeit lengthy, process, but it ensures accuracy by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach\u2014lead me to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: Each time I see 1+3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n2. Then, moving out, 1+3(1+3).\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3)).\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses: Starting from the left, after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)), and each time it's another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. First ( after 3: 1\n2. Next ( inside that: 2\n3. Next: 3\n4. Next:4\n5. Next:5\n6. Next:6\n7. Next:7\n8. Next:8\n9. Next:9\n10. Next:10\n\nWait, so actually, there are 10 layers here because each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, I might have miscounted earlier. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, now I'm confused. So, if there are 10 layers, then Layer 10 would be 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10), which would be 3*88573. That would change everything. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check the original expression again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then inside, (1+3(\n3.

Finally, the outermost one: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nWait, but the outermost is just 3 times the 10th layer, so maybe there are 9 layers inside, making the total layers 10 including the outermost. But I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Maybe the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so the number of layers is the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me count them:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1.

And so on, until the innermost (1+3.\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let's count how many opening parentheses there are:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nFrom the start:\n\n- 3(\n- Then inside, 1+3(\n- Then another 1+3(\n- And so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. After 3: ( \n2. Then inside that, ( \n3. Then another ( \n4. Another ( \n5. Another ( \n6. Another ( \n7. Another ( \n8. Another ( \n9. Another ( \n10. The last ( before the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. That means there are 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought there were 10 layers, I ended up with 88573, which seems contradictory. Let me clarify: if the expression is 3*(Layer 9), then Layer 9 is 29524, so the total is 88572. Alternatively, if Layer 10 is 88573, then the expression would be 3*88573=265719, which seems way too large. So, I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nLet me recount the layers carefully. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n10. Finally, the outermost one: 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, so actually, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is the innermost (1+3). So, that would mean there are 9 layers inside, making the total layers 10 if we include the outermost 3. But I'm getting confused again. Maybe a better approach is to count the number of '1+3's. Each '1+3' is part of a layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time you see '1+3(', that's a new layer. Let me count how many times '1+3(' appears:\n\n1. After the initial 3, we have '1+3('\n2. Inside that, another '1+3('\n3. And so on, until the innermost '1+3'.\n\nSo, let's count the number of '1+3(':\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '1+3(' is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then inside that, 1+3(\n3. Then another 1+3(\n4. Another 1+3(\n5. Another 1+3(\n6. Another 1+3(\n7. Another 1+3(\n8. Another 1+3(\n9. Another 1+3(\n10. The last one before the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, so that's 9 '1+3(' instances, meaning there are 9 layers. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 10 layers, but now I'm getting 9 layers. Let me confirm by writing out the layers step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought there were 10 layers, I ended up with Layer 10 as 88573, which doesn't make sense because the expression is 3*(Layer 9), not 3*(Layer 10). So, I think the correct number of layers is 9, making the final answer 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again by counting the number of closing parentheses. The expression ends with )))))))) after the innermost 1+3. Let me count the number of )) at the end:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nAfter the innermost (1+3), there are 9 closing parentheses: ))))))))).\n\nWait, no, let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach (1+3) has one closing ), so for each layer, we have an additional ). Let me count the number of ) at the end:\n\nThe expression ends with )))))))) after the innermost (1+3). Let me count:\n\nAfter the innermost (1+3), there are 8 closing parentheses, right? Because the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the innermost (1+3), there are 8 ), making a total of 8 closing parentheses. Therefore, the number of layers is 8. Wait, that can't be. Let me see:\n\nWait, no. Each layer adds another closing parenthesis. Let me think differently. Each time you have a (1+3(...)), it requires a corresponding ). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times (1+3 is nested, which is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from how I'm counting. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 10). So, that would mean there are 10 layers, with Layer 10 being the innermost. But that contradicts my earlier counting. I'm getting confused because depending on how I look at it, the number of layers changes.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of '1 + 3*' instances. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nSo, each time you move out a layer, you add another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times '1 + 3*(...)' occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the initial 3*, there are 9 instances of '1 + 3*(...)'.\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of '1 + 3(':\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3(\n2. Then inside that, 1 + 3(\n3. Then another 1 + 3(\n4. Another 1 + 3(\n5. Another 1 + 3(\n6. Another 1 + 3(\n7. Another 1 + 3(\n8. Another 1 + 3(\n9. Another 1 + 3(\n10. The last one before the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, so that's 9 '1 + 3(' instances, meaning there are 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 10 layers, leading to a different result. Let me confirm once more. The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the confusion was from miscounting the layers, but after careful counting, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...), leading to the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). The outermost term is multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:** 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me verify if I computed each layer correctly, because sometimes with so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used to compute this without calculating each layer, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 3L_{n-1} + 1\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\), we derive a closed-form formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back through the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, all layers check out. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, digit 2. 2*3=6+1=7, digit 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, digit 5. 9*3=27+1=28, carryover 2, digit 8. 5*3=15+2=17, carryover 1, digit 7. 2*3=6+1=7, digit 7. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recompute each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a sequence. Let's denote a_n as the value of Layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A=0. But in our case, we have a finite number of layers, so maybe we can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Alternatively, let's compute a few terms and see if we can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, each a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, for n=1, a_1=4; n=2, a_2=13; and so on. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 7, 8, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because when I write it out, it's 88572. Wait, let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place:5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1.\n- Hundred-thousands place:2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right: 7 (hundred thousands), 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 787572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 is 88572, which is a 5-digit number, not 6 digits. Wait, I think I messed up the places. Let me try again.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, no carry.\n\n5*3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8.\n\nSo, the digits from right to left are 2,7,5,8,8.\n\nWait, that's 88572, which is correct. So, the result is 88572, a 5-digit number. So, my initial breakdown was wrong because I miscounted the places, but the correct result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1=4, it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. The closed-form formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I found earlier. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any errors in the calculations now. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of a geometric series, we determine the value of the innermost expression and propagate it outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost value by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because that seems a bit off. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using a formula, especially if they're repeated multiple times. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To find L_9, we can compute each step as we did before. Alternatively, this is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants. To find C, we can solve for the steady-state solution, which is when L_n = L_{n-1} = C. So, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Wait, that seems a bit odd because our layers are all positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recognize that each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I didn't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach also led me to the same result, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again, but maybe in a different way or check if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Wait, actually, this is a recurrence relation. Let me define it more formally. Let me denote a_n as the nth term, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, c = 3, d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is the result after one iteration. So, perhaps the initial term a_0 is 1, and a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, using the formula, a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Since a_0 = 1, then a_n = 3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me compute a_1 using this formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. a_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, the outermost term is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Then, divide by 2: 177144 /2=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. That's reassuring because both methods gave me the same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the exponentiation: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^11=177147, minus 3 is 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Perfect. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo the computation of each layer up to Layer 9 is correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because that seems like a very large number. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of Layer n. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be computed as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's compute that:\n\n3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 =88572. Same result.\n\nSo, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me try computing a few more layers using the formula to see if it holds.\n\nFor example, Layer 10 would be (3^{11} -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. Wait, but in our problem, we only have up to Layer 9, so that's fine.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is essentially building a geometric progression. Each time, we're adding 1 and then tripling it, which leads to exponential growth. So, the numbers get large quickly, which explains why the final result is over 80,000.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to exponential growth. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a general formula to compute each layer efficiently. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, compute each layer's value:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the General Formula:**\n   Recognize the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 and solve it to find the nth term:\n   - The general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n   - For Layer 9 (n=9): L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let me do it another way: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So 1500 + 60 + 12 = 1572. Now add 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, that's a nonhomogeneous recurrence relation because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Either way, the result is the same. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). By recursively computing each layer up to \\( L_9 \\), we find \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the next nested term.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out:**\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:** \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me verify that multiplication because I think I might have messed up the carries. Let me write it out:\n\n    29524\n  x    3\n  -------\n    88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. 3 * 4 is 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Then 3*2 is 6 plus 1 is 7. 3*5 is 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 3*9 is 27 plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 3*2 is 6 plus 2 is 8. So yes, 88572 is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each time there's a ( after a 3, so starting from the first 3, the next is 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of nested 3(...): It starts with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), and each time another 3(1 + 3(...)) is added. So how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). From the original expression, I think there are 8 layers after the first 3. Wait, let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each time moving out, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3(...) terms. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is layer 1, then 1 + 3*(layer1) is layer2, up to layer9, and then the outermost 3*(layer9). So, yes, 9 layers in total, each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Therefore, my initial computation was correct, with layer9 being 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me check the layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might form a geometric progression. Let me try to express it in terms of a geometric series.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nI see a pattern here. Each layer adds another term that's a power of 3. Specifically, a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, but when I computed a3 earlier, I got 40, which is correct because 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Each a_n is equal to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}.\n\nBecause each time we're adding another power of 3.\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\na2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 +81 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121.\n\nWait, that's a pattern. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for example:\n\na1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = 4.\n\na2 = (3^3 -1)/2=13.\n\na3 = (3^4 -1)/2=40.\n\na4 = (3^5 -1)/2=121.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, if we have n layers, then a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, for a1, which is 1 +3, that's two terms: 3^0 +3^1, so n=2 terms, but a1 corresponds to n=1 in the layers.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for a1, n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=4, which matches.\n\na2, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=13, which matches.\n\na3, n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=40, which matches.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, if there are 9 layers, then a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking back at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...). Starting from the innermost, each 3(...) is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen 1+3(...)\n\nSo, how many 3(...) are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach 3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 3(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, it's another layer.\n\nWait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, then inside, another 3(...), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3(...) terms.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 3(...) is a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Each time we have a 3(...), that's a layer. So starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer by wrapping another 3(...).\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) sections:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 +3, which is inside the next layer.\n\n2. Then, 1 +3*(...), which is the next layer.\n\nContinuing until the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times 3 is multiplied by a term. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) \u2192 Layer 3\n...\nContinuing until Layer 9, which would be the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, so if each 3*(...) is a layer, then there are 9 layers, each adding another 3*(...). Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is (1 + 3*(Layer8)), and so on, down to Layer1 being (1 + 3).\n\nTherefore, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers, which is 9.\n\nSo, Layer9 would be a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me recount the layers to confirm that n=9.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time, we have a 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nAfter the first 3, the first opening parenthesis starts the innermost layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent 3( starts a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me look at the structure:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...), which itself contains 1 + 3*(...), and so on.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer1.\n\n- Then, moving out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer1), which is Layer2.\n\n- Then, 1 + 3*(Layer2) is Layer3.\n\n- This continues until Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8).\n\n- Then, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nTherefore, the number of layers is 9, each corresponding to a 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, with n=9, we get a9=29524, and then 3*a9=88572.\n\nJust to double-check, let me compute a few layers manually to ensure the formula works.\n\nCompute a1: 1 +3=4. Using the formula: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\na2:1 +3*(4)=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na3:1 +3*13=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na4:1 +3*40=121.

Hmm, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly to verify.

Therefore, I think the final answer is indeed 88572. But wait, I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, but I started counting from Layer 1 as the innermost. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of (1+3(...)), so that means there are nine layers. So, Layer 1: innermost (1+3) Layer 9: outermost (1+3(...)) So, I think my counting was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem since we only have nine layers. But just for curiosity's sake, let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) + 1 = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Comparing to a_n = C*3^n + D, we get D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the general formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the final result is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might be similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n represents the value at each layer, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging B into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 3A + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result as computing each layer step by step. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I think I've solved it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Write down 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7 (from 2*3+1), 7 (from 5*3+2), 8 (from 9*3+1), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3+1), 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 has only 5 digits, so the result should be 6 digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\nSo the result is 88572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check Layer 8 again. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 was 3280. So 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can represent this nested expression, which might help me verify it without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(the previous one). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, we can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Suppose the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Hmm, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make an error in the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has 9 layers, starting from the innermost 1+3, so when I compute up to Layer 9, that's the argument inside the outermost 3(...). So, yes, multiplying by 3 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that this expression is similar to a geometric series. Let me think about expanding the expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to write it out step by step, expanding each layer:\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\nLet me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So E_1 = 1 + 3, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1, and so on.\n\nBut in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*E_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I considered E_1 as 1+3, then E_2 as 1+3*E_1, etc., up to E_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see it as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, when I expand the expression, each layer adds a term that's 3^k, but let me see:\n\nLet me try expanding E_9:\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7\n...\nE_1 = 1 + 3\n\nSo, if I expand E_9, it would be:\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWhich, when expanded, would be:\n\n1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1 + 3^9*1\n\nWait, that can't be right because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, but let me check:\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), so when you expand E_9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which would indeed be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9, but that's a geometric series.\n\nWait, but that's only if each layer is fully expanded, but in reality, each E_n is 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which leads to E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 as we found earlier.\n\nWait, but let's see: For example, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, E_3 = 40 = (81 -1)/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the expanded form, each E_n is a sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n, but that's not exactly correct because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, no, actually, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, so when expanded, E_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, that would mean E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly what we have. So, yes, E_n is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. Each step checks out, and both the iterative computation and the formula using the geometric series give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By recognizing this as a geometric series and applying the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is defined as \\( E_n = 1 + 3 \\times E_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Find the Formula**: The solution to the recurrence relation \\( E_n = 1 + 3E_{n-1} \\) is \\( E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute for n=9**: Since there are 9 layers, \\( E_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that makes sense. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step worked well. I was worried I might have messed up one of the layers, but going back and checking each one confirmed that everything adds up correctly. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric progression but with a multiplier inside each term. Wait, actually, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer n has value (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think that's thorough enough. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

The problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, each adding 1 + 3*(previous). So, the first layer is 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, as I did before. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, starting from a_1, which corresponds to n=1, we have a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. Similarly, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which also matches. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, I could recognize that this nested expression is similar to a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it to see if I can find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Now, since we have 9 layers, that corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gave me the same result. So, whether by recognizing the recurrence relation or by brute-force computation, the answer comes out the same. I think I'm confident now that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Recognizing this pattern allows us to compute the result efficiently, leading to the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, the final result should be 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct) Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. The general formula for such a nested expression can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me recall that formula. If we have an expression like a + r*b + r^2*c + ... + r^n*k, the sum can be found using the formula for a geometric series. But in this case, each term is of the form 1 + 3*something. So, perhaps each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... and so on, up to a_9. So, the problem is essentially computing 3*a_9. Now, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => Subtract 3C from both sides: -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern at first, computing each layer step by step was a solid approach, albeit a bit more time-consuming. Either way, the result is consistent. I think I've got it right. Just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication step again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, reading from top to bottom: 7, 8, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 7 (from 2*3), then 8 (from 9*3), then 7 (from 5*3), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3), and finally 2 (from 4*3). Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, when multiplying by 3, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carry 0. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems different from my initial breakdown. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place):\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place):\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place):\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Add the carried 1: 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place):\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6. Add the carried 2: 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, I think my initial breakdown was a bit confused because I was writing the digits in the wrong order. But upon correctly computing each digit, it's 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponentiation earlier: 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, that's correct. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, everything checks out.\n\nI think I've solved it correctly. It was a bit tedious with all the layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation formula was a quicker way, but since I didn't see it immediately, computing each layer was a good backup plan. Either way, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. So putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1000 = 89000, then 89000 - 428 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Each step involves multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is actually forming a geometric series, but since it's nested so deeply, computing each layer step by step is the straightforward approach. Alternatively, I could model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a moment. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, it's a linear recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. In general, for such a recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This kind of recurrence can be solved using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern might help. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, which is similar to a geometric progression but with an added constant. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
