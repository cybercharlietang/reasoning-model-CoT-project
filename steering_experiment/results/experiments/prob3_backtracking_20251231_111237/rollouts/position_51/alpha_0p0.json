    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems off. Let me check my multiplication again because that's a big number and I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Hmm, so that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer adds another set of (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1. 1+3( 2. 1+3( 3. 1+3( 4. 1+3( 5. 1+3( 6. 1+3( 7. 1+3( 8. 1+3( 9. 1+3( So, actually, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). So, my initial count was correct, 9 layers. Therefore, the computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 was correct, leading to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Wait, but let me confirm each step again because it's easy to make an arithmetic error in such a long computation. Let's go through each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Each layer can be represented recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, but in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's check again.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, the innermost is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, then Layer 2: a_2 = 13, etc., up to Layer 9: a_9 = 29524.\n\nUsing the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, just to make sure, I can compute 3^10 = 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem with nine layers. By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step until reaching the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is 3 times a nested sum where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9 result**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 8*3=24, write 4, carry 2.

So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.

Wait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think I did it right. Let me just check one more time by computing each layer step by step. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might save time if I have to compute similar expressions in the future. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Suppose I have a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is more efficient. But since I was already computing each layer manually, I arrived at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time we have a new (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each time we have another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(...\n\nSo, the first ( is layer 1, then each subsequent ( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost part is 1+3, so maybe the number of layers is 9 because the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer wraps around that.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) parts:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nEach time, we have a new layer. So, how many times does 1 + 3(...) occur?\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9 because after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach ( after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is layer 1: 1 + 3(...\n- Then inside that, another ( for layer 2: 1 + 3(...\n- This continues until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the (:\n\n1. ( after 3\n2. ( after 1 + 3\n3. ( after 1 + 3\n4. ( after 1 + 3\n5. ( after 1 + 3\n6. ( after 1 + 3\n7. ( after 1 + 3\n8. ( after 1 + 3\n9. ( after 1 + 3\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, but the innermost is just 1 + 3, so the number of layers is 9? Or is it 8? Because each ( adds a layer, but the innermost doesn't have another (, it's just 1 + 3.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each time you have a 1 + 3(...), that's a layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, layer n=9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in the carry-over. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo reading the digits from top to bottom: 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, so the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern here that can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me denote the layers as a_1, a_2, ..., a_9, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric progression but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let me try that.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result again. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work twice, once by computing each layer step by step and once by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations. Both methods led me to the same result, so I don't think I made any mistakes. It was a bit time-consuming, especially with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I also had to recall how to solve linear recurrences, which was a good exercise. I'm glad I remembered that method because it saved me from computing each layer manually, although in this case, since there were only nine layers, it wasn't too bad. Anyway, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(previous layer):\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer follows a certain formula, perhaps a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider L(0) = 1, then L(0)=1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. So we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and A + B = 1. Subtracting the second equation from the first: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from A + B =1, B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, that can be written as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1)-1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, then Layer 9 is (3^(10)-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L(n) = 1 + 3 \\times L(n-1) \\) with \\( L(1) = 4 \\).

Let me go back through each layer and make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This seems like a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a_1=4; n=2, a_2=13; n=3, a_3=40; and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think I've done this correctly, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572. Yep, that all checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can derive a formula to find the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence is known to be L_n = (L_0 - b/(1-a)) * a^n + b/(1-a)\n\nWait, but let me make sure I have the correct initial conditions.

Let me count the digits:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0\n\nSo the result is 8 7 8 5 7 2 \u2192 Wait, that would be 878572? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because 29524 \u00d73 should be 88572. Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the number of digits. Let me do it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d73 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d73 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d73 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d73 = 60\n\n4 \u00d73 =12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d73 =88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, right? So the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1:1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9. So I think I accounted for all 9 layers correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve it:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, assume a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K -3K=1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow apply initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 =3C -1/2 \u2192 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for Layer n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check with n=1: a_1= (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which is correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms it. So I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, ultimately leading to the outermost layer evaluating to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})\\).

Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. But I'm a bit unsure because 88572 seems like a large number, but given the multiple layers of multiplication, it might be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Comparing this with a_n = A*3^n + B, we get B = 3B + 1, which simplifies to -2B = 1, so B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to make sure it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, and there are multiple layers, perhaps the total expression can be expressed as a sum of a geometric series. Let me explore that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3))...)). Let me try to write this out more explicitly. Starting from the innermost: Let's denote the innermost term as t_1 = 1 + 3. Then, t_2 =1 +3*t_1=1+3*(1+3). t_3=1+3*t_2=1+3*(1+3*(1+3)). And so on, up to t_9, and the entire expression is 3*t_9. As we saw earlier, t_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, t_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Therefore, the expression is 3*29524=88572. So, I think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, and a_{n}=1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, the value we're looking for is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If we assume a_n = C*3^n + D, then substituting into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, let's equate the two sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we derive a general formula for each layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be faster or more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^p. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. We can factor out 1/2: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: L_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n = 9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let's see if that approach works. Starting from the innermost layer, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. However, since each term also adds 1, it's not a straightforward geometric series, but perhaps we can express it as such. Wait, actually, when we derived the formula using the recurrence relation, we saw that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we used. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's another way to express the final result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. To make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents, let me verify 3^10 and 3^11. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 3^11 = 177147 Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is 59049, and 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, (3^11 - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, regardless of the method I use\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series adjusted for the added 1 each time\u2014the result is the same: 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. It was a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped ensure accuracy. I also considered whether there might be an alternative approach, like using a formula for a geometric series, but since each term isn't just a multiple of the previous term but also adds 1, the recurrence relation approach was more appropriate. However, recognizing that the layers follow a specific pattern allowed me to derive a closed-form formula, which is a powerful tool in solving such problems efficiently, especially when dealing with a large number of layers. In summary, by methodically computing each layer, verifying with a recurrence relation, and cross-checking with an alternative formula, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572.

Let me do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that could have been recognized earlier, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's test this. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct). For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 (correct). For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 (correct). Yes, this formula works. So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is correct. I think that's solid.

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nWait, actually, each time we add another layer, so starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), etc. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct because each layer is one more step. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try computing a smaller version to see if my approach is correct. For example, let's say the expression was 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). How would that compute? Let's do it step by step. Innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=13. Next layer: 1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. So, the result would be 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3(40) = 120. That's correct.

So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Wait, actually, more precisely, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Let me try solving it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry over 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, carry over 2, write 7. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1, write 7. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 3*3=9, write 9.

Write down 8.\n- Now, since there are no more digits, the carry over 2 would go to the next place, making it 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 29,524, so multiplying by 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12.

Ten-thousands place:8.\n- So, writing it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000\n\n500 *3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them all up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 *3=88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's go back. So, I started with Layer 1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of them.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me check if I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me count the opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, 9 layers in total. So, Layer1 to Layer9 as I did before. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 1 + 3B\n\nEquate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer9. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572\n\nSame result. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed the layers step by step, I ended up with Layer9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But using the formula, I got the same result, so that's reassuring.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.

So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, the final result is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is indeed following the recurrence. To find a closed-form solution, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct. So, I think I did it right. But just to be thorough, let me try computing the layers again in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula I can use to avoid computing each layer manually. Hmm, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard solution method involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find the value of the expression. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final result of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let's define L_n as the value of layer n, where L_1 = 4, as we found earlier. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can express this recurrence relation as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me check: The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, we arrive at the same answer. I think that's solid. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer results in 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Adding 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go back and verify each step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this recursively. The problem has 9 layers, so we need L_9, and then the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, then also tried to find a general formula to confirm the result, which matches. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me confirm using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Wait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from a0=1+3=4, then a1=1+3*a0, a2=1+3*a1, and so on up to a8=1+3*a7. Then, the total expression is 3*a8. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a0=4. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a0=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a0=4: 4 = A*3^0 + (-1/2) => 4 = A - 1/2 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2. Let's check this for n=0: a0=(9*1 -1)/2=(8)/2=4, which is correct. For n=1: a1=(9*3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches what I had before. For n=2: a2=(9*9 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=8, a8=(9*3^8 -1)/2. Let's compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, a8=(9*6561 -1)/2. Compute 9*6561: 6561*9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000+4500=58500; 58500+540=59040; 59040+9=59049. So, 9*6561=59049. Then, 59049 -1=59048. So, a8=59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a8=3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me confirm that each layer was correctly computed because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off. Let me go through the layers again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40 (correct). Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 (correct). Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 (correct).

So, it seems that each step is correct, and the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is being multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we're computing a_9, and then multiplying by 3. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: a_1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric series but with an added constant. The closed-form solution using the recurrence relation is more efficient, especially for larger n, but since n=9 here, computing each layer step by step is manageable. I think I've confirmed it enough times, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.

Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, after carefully checking each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again more carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down:\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*800=2400\n\n3*40=120\n\n3*1=3\n\nAdding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more formally to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations now.\n\nJust to recap, the approach was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Computed each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n\n3.

So 3 times that is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Sometimes, when dealing with repeated expressions like this, there's a formula or a pattern that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives me the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, and the number of layers is 9, the total expression would be 3*(a_9) where a_9 is the 9th term. But regardless of the approach, both methods lead me to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\nSo, the result is 88572.

That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find the solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.

Maybe it's better to do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carry.\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, no carry.\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carry.\nFinally, the first digit: 2 * 3 = 6 \u2192 write down 6.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the digits are:\n\nPosition: 5 4 3 2 1\nDigits:    2 9 5 2 4\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the positions. Let me write it as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (units place):\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 30,000 \u00d7 3 = 90,000\n\nBut 29,524 is 30,000 - 476.\n\nSo, 90,000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29,524, and then 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572. So that's the final result.\n\nLet me just double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step follows logically from the previous one. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7previous_layer, it's a recursive relation. Let me define L(n) as the value of layer n, where n goes from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, L(n) = 1 + 3\u00d7L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 3\u00d7L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3\u00d7L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C\u00d73^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3\u00d7A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C\u00d73^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C\u00d73^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29,524, and the entire expression is 3\u00d729,524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, L(9)=29,524, so the final result is 3\u00d729,524=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations or reasoning. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have missed a layer because when I counted the layers, I started from 1 to 9, but the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that should be correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the layers**: The expression has nine layers of nested parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
