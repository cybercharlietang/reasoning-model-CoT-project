    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I'm wondering if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, maybe this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed with a formula. Let me think about that. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of the formula, the original expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we can work from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n1. Compute each layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next.\n2. The expression follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n3. Using the recursive formula, we compute each layer up to the ninth layer.\n4. Finally, multiply the result of the ninth layer by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n**Final Step:** Multiply the result by 3:\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So yes, it's 88572. So the final result is 88,572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: Each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers, right? Because each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), and there are 9 such expressions inside each other. So when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, giving 88,572, that should be correct. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because 3*(1+3*(...)) nine times seems like a lot, and 88,572 seems plausible but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this is a geometric series. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. So a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.

That seems correct. Wait, but when I was computing Layer 7, I had 3*1093. Let me compute that again: 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. That's correct. Then Layer 8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So that's correct. Then, 3*29524: As above, 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems to be the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. If there were more layers, perhaps a recursive formula or a geometric series approach would be better, but for nine layers, step-by-step is feasible. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way to confirm. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps, checked my work using two different methods, and both led me to the same conclusion. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula to compute the final result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's count them: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1 + 3(...) adds a layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but let me verify the computations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). So, yes, I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Suppose we define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step to see if that helps. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Then, 1 +3*4=13. Then,1 +3*13=40. Then,1 +3*40=121. Then,1 +3*121=364. Then,1 +3*364=1093. Then,1 +3*1093=3280. Then,1 +3*3280=9841. Then,1 +3*9841=29524. Then,3*29524=88572. So, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write it in terms of powers of 3. Since each layer is 1 +3*previous, which is similar to 3^{n} + something. But I think the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward. Alternatively, I can think of each term as 1 + 3*(next term). So, working from the inside out, each term is 1 +3*(next term). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3, then each step out multiplies by 3 and adds 1. So, the total number of layers is 9, as we have 9 sets of parentheses. Therefore, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, we get a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. So, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 repeatedly. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is essentially 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 0, but since it's nonhomogeneous, we can find the particular solution. Alternatively, since it's a linear recurrence, we can write it as a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r + 3 = 0, so r = -3. But since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a particular solution of the form a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*(-3)^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*(-3)^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = -3A - 1/2 => 3A = -1/2 - 4 = -9/2 => A = (-9/2)/(-3) = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2. Now, since we're dealing with a_9, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3/2)*(-3)^9 - 1/2. First, compute (-3)^9: (-3)^9 = -19683. So, a_9 = (3/2)*(-19683) - 1/2 = (-59049/2) - 1/2 = (-59050)/2 = -29525. Wait, that's negative, but when I computed it step by step earlier, I got 29524. That can't be right. There must be a mistake in my approach. Alternatively, perhaps the indexing is off. Let me check. I defined a_1 as 4, which is correct. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is correct. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence is correct. But the general solution gave me a negative number, which contradicts the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Let me re-examine the recurrence relation. The problem is that each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, but when I set up the general solution, I might have misapplied the initial conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the expression as a sum. Each layer adds another 3 times the previous term. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps the expression can be written as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see. Let me denote the innermost term as T1 = 1 + 3. Then, T2 = 1 + 3*T1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. T3 = 1 + 3*T2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. T4 = 1 + 3*T3 = 1 + 120 = 121. T5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. T6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. T7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. T8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. T9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, T9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*T9 = 88572. Alternatively, I can think of each Tn as 1 + 3*Tn-1, which is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is as before, but perhaps the particular solution is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence again. The recurrence is Tn = 1 + 3*Tn-1, with T1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is Tn^h = C*(-3)^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, is a constant. Let me assume Tn^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Tn = C*(-3)^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition T1 = 4: 4 = C*(-3)^1 - 1/2 => 4 = -3C - 1/2 => 3C = -1/2 - 4 = -9/2 => C = (-9/2)/(-3) = 3/2. So, Tn = (3/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2. Now, let's compute T9: T9 = (3/2)*(-3)^9 - 1/2. (-3)^9 = -19683. So, T9 = (3/2)*(-19683) - 1/2 = (-59049/2) - 1/2 = (-59050)/2 = -29525. Wait, that's negative, but earlier, T9 was 29524. That's a problem. There must be an error in the way I'm applying the recurrence. Maybe the indexing is off. Let me check: When n=1, T1=4. Using the formula: T1 = (3/2)*(-3)^1 - 1/2 = (-9/2) - 1/2 = -10/2 = -5. But T1 is 4, not -5. So, the formula is incorrect. Therefore, my approach to solving the recurrence must be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should index the terms differently. Let me try starting the indexing from n=0. Let me redefine the recurrence as T0 = 1, T1 = 1 + 3*T0 = 4, T2 = 1 + 3*T1 = 13, and so on. Then, the recurrence is Tn = 1 + 3*Tn-1, with T0 = 1. Let's solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is Tn^h = C*(-3)^n. The particular solution is K, so plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Tn = C*(-3)^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition T0 = 1: 1 = C*(-3)^0 - 1/2 => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, Tn = (3/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2. Now, let's compute T9: T9 = (3/2)*(-3)^9 - 1/2. (-3)^9 = -19683. So, T9 = (3/2)*(-19683) - 1/2 = (-59049/2) - 1/2 = (-59050)/2 = -29525. Wait, that's still negative. But according to the step-by-step calculation, T9 is 29524, which is positive. So, something is wrong here. Maybe the formula is correct, but I'm misapplying it. Let me check for n=1: T1 should be 4. Using the formula: T1 = (3/2)*(-3)^1 - 1/2 = (-9/2) - 1/2 = -10/2 = -5. But T1 is 4, not -5. That's not matching. Therefore, my approach is flawed. Maybe I should try a different method. Let me try expanding the expression step by step again, just to confirm. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the formula approach must have an error. Perhaps the recurrence relation is not being applied correctly because the number of layers is 9, but the indexing starts at 1 or 0. Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust the formula to account for the number of layers correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that. Each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), it's similar to a geometric series. Let me denote S as the entire expression. Wait, no, S would be the entire expression, but it's 3*(something). Alternatively, let me denote the innermost expression as x, and see if I can find a pattern. Let me try to find a pattern by computing the first few layers and see if I can spot a geometric progression. Let's compute the value for each layer:\n\nNumber of layers (n): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nValue (Vn): 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524\n\nNow, let's see if there's a pattern in the values. Let me compute the ratio between successive terms:\n\n13 / 4 = 3.25\n\n40 /13 \u2248 3.077\n\n121 /40 = 3.025\n\n364 /121 \u2248 3.008\n\n1093 /364 \u2248 3.003\n\n3280 /1093 \u2248 3.001\n\n9841 /3280 \u2248 3.000\n\n29524 /9841 \u2248 3.000\n\nSo, as the number of layers increases, the ratio approaches 3. That suggests that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term, which makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the growth is exponential, with base 3. Therefore, the value of the expression with n layers is roughly 3^n, but adjusted by some constants. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Vn.\n\nFrom the recurrence relation Vn = 1 + 3*Vn-1, with V1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Vn = 3*Vn-1, which has the solution Vn^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution Vn^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Vn = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition V1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is Vn = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test it with n=1:\n\nV1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: V2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: V3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: V4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: V5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: V6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: V7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: V8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: V9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the closed-form formula is Vn = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. In this problem, we have 9 layers, so V9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*V9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it that way to confirm.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I double-checked using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Adding 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, each ( adds a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after the first 3: 1. 3(1+3(2. 1+3(3. 1+3(4. 1+3(5. 1+3(6. 1+3(7. 1+3(8. 1+3(9. 1+3)))))))))) So, that's 9 layers, each starting with 1+3. So, I think my earlier calculation was correct, with Layer 1 being the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 being the outermost, which I then multiplied by 3. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but let me check if I computed each layer correctly. Maybe I made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let's go through each layer again step by step. Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), with nine layers. But since it's nine layers, each layer is 1 + 3*next layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost, then a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*a1, etc., up to a9, and E=3*a9. Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, my approach was correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let me see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)}=K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K=-1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, E=3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a layer, which would throw off all the subsequent layers.\n\nSo, starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4, then L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc., up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} is L_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. To find B, set L_n = B, then B = 1 + 3B \u2192 B = -0.5. But since we're dealing with integers, maybe it's better to find a pattern or use iteration.\n\nAlternatively, solving the recurrence relation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -0.5.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 0.5.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 0.5 \u2192 4 = 3C - 0.5 \u2192 3C = 4.5 \u2192 C = 1.5.\n\nThus, L_n = 1.5*3^n - 0.5.\n\nBut 1.5 is 3/2, so L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods agree, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is essentially building a geometric progression. Since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), and the previous term itself is similar, it's like expanding a geometric series with ratio 3. But since each layer adds another term, it's a finite geometric series with nine terms, but the way it's structured, it's more like a nested multiplication.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, whether step-by-step computation or using the recurrence relation, the result is the same. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Start from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by plugging the result of the previous layer into the next one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\n3. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gave 29,524, multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\n4. Verified the result using the recurrence relation method, arriving at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But let me check Layer 9 again: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's adding up as 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: Each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's a layer. Let me count: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are nine 1 + 3(...) before the outermost 3(...). So, that would mean Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I did before. So, 9 layers, each computed step by step. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. Great, so this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same answer without manually computing each layer. That's a good cross-verification. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, 2 is the ten thousands place, 9 is thousands, 5 is hundreds, 2 is tens, 4 is ones. So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 2*3=6, write 6. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10, carry 1. 9+9=18 +1=19, carry 1. 2+2=4 +1=5. So, 59048.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). So, all layers check out. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to represent it in a general form. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. Here, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + (c/(r-1)). Wait, let me recall the formula for the solution of a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. This method is faster and avoids manually computing each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, both methods are manageable. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. The key insight is recognizing the recursive structure and finding a pattern or formula to compute the value without having to do each multiplication step by step. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. By solving the recurrence, we find that each layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number. Let me verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As before, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572. So, yes, 88572 is correct. Wait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time I have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times the pattern 1+3 occurs. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, so let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then moving out, each time we have another 1+3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a layer. Let's count how many times we have 1+3(...). Let me write it as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\nLayer 4: 1+3(Layer3)\nLayer 5: 1+3(Layer4)\nLayer 6: 1+3(Layer5)\nLayer 7: 1+3(Layer6)\nLayer 8: 1+3(Layer7)\nLayer 9: 1+3(Layer8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, my initial calculation was correct, with Layer1 to Layer9, each time computing 1+3*(previous layer). So, the final result is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see if we can find a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from the homogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1=4.\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, recognizing the recurrence, solving the recurrence with the formula, and plugging in the numbers. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers get large quickly, and I might have made a multiplication error. Let me check 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. So, yes, 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way to confirm. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, there are nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). So, each layer after the first is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then 3*29524 is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 59049/2 = 29524.5, subtract 0.5 gives 29524. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\).

So, let's compute digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7. 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom, we get 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572? Wait, let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier computations because when I computed Layer 9, I might have made a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the intermediate steps. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so the outermost operation is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, and we've computed that correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute it step by step again, perhaps using a different approach. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous layer. So, starting from a1 = 4, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on up to a9. Then, the total is 3*a9. So, computing a1 through a9: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, total = 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

So, yes, 88572. So, I think that's correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression starts with 3*(...), so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from Layer 1 as 1+3=4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...))), it's a geometric series. Wait, in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, Layer 9 = L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer. That might be faster, especially if there are more layers. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. So, to recap: The expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. Starting from the innermost, each layer can be computed step by step, or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, which gives the nth layer as (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Applying this for n=9 gives 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the intermediate steps.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer, in case I made a mistake in the layers. Let me think about it. The expression is a series of nested terms: each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplifying the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. We have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It looks like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same result as before. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1.

Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9.

So the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier when computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be seen as a sum of 3^k terms. But given that we only have 9 layers, computing each step was manageable, and the formula approach confirmed the result. So, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, starting with a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut maybe we can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, just computing each layer step by step as I did initially would also lead to the correct answer, albeit a bit more time-consuming.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, each layer seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 fits. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + something. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Yes, that works. So, for the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=1 corresponds to a_1, so n=9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000+2400=29400, +123=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, it's a geometric series of sorts. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first one is inside the outermost 3(...): 1+3(...\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(...\n3. Continuing, I can see that there are 9 instances where \"1+3(\" appears, meaning there are 9 layers. So, my earlier computation with Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made an arithmetic error. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is:\n\nL(n) = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWe can solve for A and B using the initial condition and the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven that L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), and L(1) = 4.\n\nLet's plug n=1 into the general solution:\n\nL(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nNow, let's plug n=2 into the general solution and the recurrence:\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nUsing the general solution:\n\nL(2) = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. 3A + B = 4\n\n2. 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nA = 9/6 = 3/2\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL(n) = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the innermost is L(1), and the outermost is L(9). So, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L(9), and L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is:\n\n3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049 * 3 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 3^11 is 59049 * 3 = 177147. Then, 177147 - 3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1, write 7. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. So the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 is 88572? Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer to ensure that each step was correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, yes, each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (1/2)*(3^{n+1} - 1). Let me check that formula with the layers I computed. For n=1: a_1 = (1/2)*(3^{2} - 1) = (1/2)*(9 -1) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (1/2)*(3^3 -1) = (1/2)*(27 -1)=13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (1/2)*(3^4 -1)= (1/2)*(81 -1)=40 \u2714\ufe0f Yes, that seems to work. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier result. So, using the formula for the geometric series also leads us to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this.

Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. 3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11.

Wait, but let me confirm: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if the formula holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my initial condition is off. Let's try to solve the recurrence properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find the closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3a_p => 0 = 1 + 2a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, since each layer is built on the previous, using the formula could have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step by step was manageable. I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I count the number of layers, I think I might have miscounted. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of 1+3... parts. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each time I add a layer, so how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, that's nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, I think I did it right, computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88572. Wait, but let me check: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each layer adds 1 + 3*previous. So, I think my calculations are correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} first, which is 59049, then (59049 -1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step, I arrived at Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Additionally, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence and solving it, I confirmed that Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps because that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer recursively. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually. Let me compute Layer 7 again: Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer6. Layer6 was 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3=1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I've got it right. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and use it to compute the next one, proceeding outward. After computing all layers, we multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me verify each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we can write a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, we can see that a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*a_0, but in our case, a_1 = 4. Wait, maybe it's better to model it as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2=29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. I'm confident that's the right answer. So, after working through each layer step by step and then verifying with a formula, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation formula, we find that each layer's value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me list each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times 1+3( is present. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on. Let's count the opening parentheses after each 1+3: The first one is 1+3, then 1+3(, then 1+3(, etc. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3( until we reach the outermost. Let me count how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds one more until we have nine layers, I think. Wait, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. Each time I see a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3. Then moving out, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after each \"1+3\". The entire expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of layers. Each time you have a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\n\nLayer 4: 1+3(Layer3)\n\nLayer 5: 1+3(Layer4)\n\nLayer 6: 1+3(Layer5)\n\nLayer 7: 1+3(Layer6)\n\nLayer 8: 1+3(Layer7)\n\nLayer 9: 1+3(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my initial computation was correct with 9 layers, leading to Layer9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1 each time. But since the recurrence approach worked, I think that's sufficient.\n\nLet me just confirm the multiplication once more to be sure I didn't make a mistake in the final step. 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 in another way. Break it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 times 29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying using both iterative computation and a closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...), so the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is when we ignore the constant term, so the homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Since the layers go from 1 to 9, and each a_n corresponds to the nth layer, then yes, a_9 is the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9. So, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} which is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series perhaps? Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence goes: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Let me assume a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, this formula works. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the innermost Layer 1, but wait, actually, the number of layers might correspond differently. Wait, in the expression, each Layer corresponds to one nesting. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). So, yes, n=9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 = a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. That's a good check. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me check again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but that seems a bit high. Let me verify using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in the multiplication. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, I might have missed a layer. Let me count the layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, if the recurrence converges, but in this case, since each term is increasing, it's divergent. But perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency. For n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, using the formula, each layer is correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid.

Alternatively, the homogeneous solution would be A*3^n, and the general solution is a(n) = A*3^n + a_p.\n\nBut since a_p is -1/2, we can write:\n\na(n) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition a(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na(1) = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2:\n\na(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\na(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\na(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nThus, a(9) = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrived at the same result without computing each layer manually. That was a good check.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is building a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, the expression can be seen as a sum where each term is 3^n, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.\n\nWait, perhaps if I write the entire expression as a sum.\n\nLet me try to expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I write the entire expression as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nWith 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...).\n\nThis is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but since each term also has a 1 added, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, but using the formula I found earlier, a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29,524, as before.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAnother approach might be to recognize that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it as I did before.\n\nBut since I've already confirmed the result using both step-by-step computation and the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute one of the layers again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4\n\nLayer4 was 121, so 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nFinal multiplication: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1. Solving this recurrence gives a formula a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For n=9 layers, this results in 29,524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify that calculation because sometimes when I do it digit by digit, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: Let's break it into parts. 29000 * 3 = 87000. 524 * 3 = 1572. Now, add 87000 + 1572: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. Yes, that matches.

So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841.

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.

Hmm, but wait a minute, let me go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Sometimes when you do a lot of layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that's possible here. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and maybe that can help me compute it more quickly without having to compute each layer step by step. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations to make sure it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, since the expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, perhaps it's a form of a geometric series. Let me explore that angle as well. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand it all out, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see the pattern. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Wait, that's not matching exactly. Wait, 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is correct. So, each layer adds another power of 3. So, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, but that's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. So, each layer n corresponds to the sum up to 3^n, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which when expanded gives the sum up to 3^n. Therefore, for Layer 9, it's the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2, as we had before. So, this confirms again that the computation is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think I've verified it multiple ways: computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, and recognizing it as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find the result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we have L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524=88572. So that confirms it again. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let's write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3 can be thought of as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one step, which propagates through all the subsequent steps. Let me recompute each layer just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I think my final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
