    "text": " 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 27, 8, 7, 5, 2, 4, 2, 4? Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,7,8,5,2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which resembles a geometric progression. Let me explore that approach to see if I can find a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. To solve this recurrence, I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation here is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Then, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that matches the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct, and also that using the recurrence relation gives the same result, which is reassuring. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStart from the units digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me verify each step again because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again because 3*3280: 3280*3 is 9840, yes. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 9840*3? Wait, no, wait: Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Let me just make sure that when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I did it correctly. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 is 29,524. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify each step quickly to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13.

So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from ones place:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nTens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nHundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nThousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that's a lot of layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer9 is 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Wait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. From the innermost, there's 1+3, then each step adds another 3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on until there are nine layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds another layer. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the first 3, then inside is 1 + 3*(...), and each ... is another layer. Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1+3(...). It seems like there are nine layers because each time you go deeper, you add another (1+3(...). Let me confirm by writing each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers. So my earlier computation is correct, leading to Layer9=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the multiplication again because 3*29524 seems high. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), and the innermost is 1+3, so each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, when I computed Layer9 as 29524, that was the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplied by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nSo, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, and a_{n}=1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1+3*4=13\n\na_3=1+3*13=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9=29524.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1} can be found, but since we're only going up to n=9, computing each step is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n -1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^(p)=A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A=3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C=4.5 => C=1.5=3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that. Maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, next digit 2*3=6 +1=7, next 5*3=15, carryover 1, next 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, next 2*3=6 +2=8, next 9*3=27, carryover 2, next 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1, next 2*3=6 +1=7. So writing it down: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, I think. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Let's do it:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nCalculate each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplying by 3, it should result in a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nWait, but the number is 29524, which is 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 digit is 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 digit is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 digit is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 digit is 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without expanding each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nThat confirms the result again. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula to the outermost layer and then multiplying by 3, we arrive at the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3 step by step: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from top to bottom: 8,8,7,8,5,7,2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should write it as:\n\n      29,524\n    x        3\n    -----------\n      88,572\n\nYes, 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let's go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88,572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again, or perhaps look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Alternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula here since each layer is similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now that I've double-checked using the closed-form formula. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution and compute the final value.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 90000 - (476*3)=90000 - 1428= 88572. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations because if one layer is wrong, the subsequent ones will be too.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4.

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524=88572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved, but since it's only nine terms, computing each is straightforward.\n\nBut just to check, let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3K \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K=-1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 +1/2=3C \u2192 9/2=3C \u2192 C=3/2. So a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the first layer is a_1=4, which would correspond to n=1. Let's test the formula: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\na_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have nine layers, n=9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to arrive at the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step and verify with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer's value.

However, in this case, after multiplying the leftmost digit (2), we had 6 + 2 = 8, which is correct, and there's no carryover left. So, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476*3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572. But let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Perhaps recognizing a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me define the expression recursively. Let's say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n = 9, but let me check: in the expression, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, so a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, each layer outwards is a_2, a_3, ..., up to a_9, which is Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I had before.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to expanding a geometric series. But since each term is multiplied by 3, it's a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, it's more of a recursive multiplication rather than a simple geometric series. However, the formula I derived earlier using the recurrence relation gives the same result, so I think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute the entire expression step by step manually, but that would take a lot of time and is prone to errors, especially with so many layers. The recursive approach seems more efficient and less error-prone.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3. Confirm each computation to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. Use the recurrence relation approach to derive a general formula, then compute a_9.\n\n5. Multiply a_9 by 3 to get the final result.\n\n6. Verify that both methods give the same result, thus confirming the answer.\n\nYes, that seems thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think the answer is correct.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression without using the formula, just step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by the outermost 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4, as we saw. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using both iterative computation and recognizing the recurrence relation, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:** Multiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that's 88572. Wait, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524.

Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Let me check if I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B=1 \u2192 B= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 0.5 \u2192 3A = 4.5 \u2192 A=1.5 or 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula. It's interesting because it shows that for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using a closed-form formula derived from this recurrence, we determine that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3=88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). After 9 layers, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify one of the layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous term. So, starting from 1, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. Let's see if there's a formula for this kind of recursion. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Multiply the result by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe final result is $\\boxed{88572}$."

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, yes, the calculations seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it with a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step, layer 1 was a_1=4, which is (3^{2}-1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer manually and verify with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n10. Multiply by 3: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct).

So, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different methods (computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula) both lead to the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*L9.\n\nSo, each Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1)\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Lk.\n\nThis looks like a linear recurrence relation. The general form is Lk = a*L(k-1) + b. In this case, a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is Lk = (L0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^k + b/(1 - a)\n\nBut since a=3, which is greater than 1, the formula becomes Lk = (L0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^k + b/(1 - a)\n\nBut let's compute it properly. The homogeneous solution is Lk^h = C*3^k\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming Lk^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is Lk = C*3^k - 1/2\n\nUsing the initial condition L1 = 4. Wait, L1 is the first term, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo when k=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the general formula is Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: Lk = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for k=9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049\n\nSo L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recursive formula and the closed-form expression both lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1), which is a geometric progression, and thus the closed-form solution applies.\n\nBut regardless of the method, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, the result is the same.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can compute each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, so L_1 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Now, solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute L_n without having to calculate each layer step by step, which could be useful for larger n. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution, L_p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume L_p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_h + L_p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the outermost expression is 3*L_9, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down the expression from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are 9 such layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 30000 * 3 = 90000, subtract (30000 - 29524) which is 476, so 3*476=1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it faster, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. But just to check, maybe I can find a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Suppose I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the coefficients are constant, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, as Layer 1 is 4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as Layer 2 is 13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the innermost part, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, I found that the innermost value is 4, then each subsequent layer builds on that, tripling the previous result and adding 1. After nine layers, the innermost part becomes 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, I confirmed that Layer 9 is indeed 29524, leading to the same final answer. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a bit of work, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a certain formula, perhaps a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of each layer as a term in a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation.

The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)}=C*3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K=3*K +1 \u2192 K -3K=1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K=-1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n= C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4= C*3^{1} -1/2 \u21924=3C -1/2 \u21923C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising.

Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} * a_1. Since a_1 = 4, this becomes a geometric series. The sum of the series would be (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) * 4, but wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result we got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach works. The expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. The general form of a geometric series is S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1). In this case, each layer adds another power of 3. Wait, but in our problem, each term is 1 + 3*(next term), which is similar to a recurrence relation. Maybe we can model it as such. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the problem is essentially computing f(9) and then multiplying by 3. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), whose solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: f(3) = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've verified it enough ways to be confident that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer grows exponentially. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula and confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3s inside each parenthesis. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 (Layer 1). Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 3(...). Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1). Then Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2). So, each time, we add another layer. The entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, I think I did 9 layers correctly.

So 29524 \u00d73=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 +3=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 \u21d2 C -3C =1 \u21d2 -2C=1 \u21d2 C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4 =3A -1/2 \u21d2 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be represented as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me check again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 (correct). Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 (correct). Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 (correct). Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 (correct). Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 (correct). Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 (correct). Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K =1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9= 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049; 3^{11}=177147. So, (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches the earlier result. So, that's a much quicker way using the recurrence relation. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same answer, I think 88572 is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be represented as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} \\). Multiplying by 3, the final result is \\( \\frac{3^{11} - 3}{2} = 88572 \\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute it differently. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. But wait, earlier when I was computing each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29524. Let me double-check that because if I have 9 layers, each time I compute 1 + 3*(previous layer), I need to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression starts with 3*(...), so if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3(...)) adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), and each (1+3(...) is another layer. So, how many times does 1+3(...) occur? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...), so the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), and so on. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: Starting from the first ( after 3, then each ( adds a layer. Let me count the number of ( : 1. ( after 3 2. ( after 1+3 3. ( after next 1+3 4. ( 5. ( 6. ( 7. ( 8. ( 9. ( 10. ( Hmm, wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me write it out:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n))))\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1 +3, then each layer adds another (1 +3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3, that's Layer 1. Then the next layer is 1 +3*(Layer1), which is Layer2, and so on, until Layer9, which is the outermost before the final 3*. So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, computing up to Layer9 as 29524 and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me verify that again because 29524 seems like a big number, and 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n=1, L_1=4= A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. So, equation 1: 3A + B =4. Now, let's consider n=2: L_2=1 +3*L_1=1+3*4=13. Using the general solution: L_2= A*3^{2} + B =9A + B. So, equation 2:9A + B=13. Now, subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B)=13-4 =>6A=9 => A=9/6=3/2=1.5. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B=4 =>9/2 + B=4 => B=4 -9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, L_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute it using the formula: Since L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2= (3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, this would be (3^{11}-3)/2. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( L_1 = 4 \\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula and compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Solve the recurrence relation**: The general solution is \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute for \\( n = 9 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.

Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then multiply by 3:29524 *3=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression without using the formula, just to double-check.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute the innermost expression:1 +3=4.\n\nThen, moving outward:1 +3*(4)=13.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*(13)=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3:29524*3=88572.\n\nYep, same result every time. I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute 29524 *3 in another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 88572 is the right answer.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times. Each step seems correct, and the formula approach also confirms the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121 (Correct) Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 (Correct) Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 (Correct) Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 (Correct) Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 (Correct) Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 (Correct) Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, each time, we're calculating a new value based on the previous one. This is essentially a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1, it's a bit different. However, since we've already computed each layer step by step, and the numbers add up correctly, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we evaluate it from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
