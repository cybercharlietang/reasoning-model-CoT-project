    "text": " 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 7, 7, 8, 5, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nThere's no more digits, so the carry over 0 is done.\n\nWait, that gives me 88572. Hmm, but when I did the initial breakdown, I thought 29524 *3 would be more. Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because maybe I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go back and compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then Layer 8: 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed 3*29524 earlier, I thought I got 88572, but when I broke it down digit by digit, I thought it might be different. Let me confirm once more.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(...)). So each time, there's a 1+3( ... ), and each layer adds another. So the innermost is Layer1:1+3. Then Layer2:1+3(Layer1), up to Layer9:1+3(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So yes, I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost, each step is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLet me define L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nL3=1 +3*13=40.\n\nL4=1+3*40=121.\n\nL5=1+3*121=364.\n\nL6=1+3*364=1093.\n\nL7=1+3*1093=3280.\n\nL8=1+3*3280=9841.\n\nL9=1+3*9841=29524.\n\nSo each layer is indeed following the pattern. So when I multiply L9 by 3, I get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Suppose I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers. The value can be found recursively, but in this case, a=1 and b=3, and n=9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 =1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3*4=13.\n\nL3=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3*13=40.\n\nWait, but perhaps each Lk =1 +3*Lk-1.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation where Lk =1 +3*Lk-1, with L1=4.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is Lk = A*3^k + C, where C is a constant.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. The homogeneous solution is Lk^h = A*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume Lk^p = B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B =1 +3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Lk = A*3^k -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1=4.\n\nSo, when k=1, L1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, Lk= (3/2)*3^k -1/2= (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, L9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series with each term being multiplied by 3 each time, but with an additional 1 each layer. But since the solution via recurrence gives the correct answer, I think that's sufficient.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no, that might not be the correct way. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.

So the number is 7 8 7 5 2 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me write it out properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 29524*3 should be 88572. Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), expanding step by step seems feasible. Let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplifying: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer, which is a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, expanding each layer and using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started with the innermost parentheses, computed each layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, moving outward each time until I reached the outermost layer. Then, I multiplied that result by 3 to get the final answer. It seems systematic, and each step built on the previous one. I don't think I missed any layers because I counted each layer from 1 to 9, and each time I computed the next layer correctly. The multiplication at the end also checked out with two different methods, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate coefficients: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical approach here. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursively defined expression. Let me try to express this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, no, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the value before the final multiplication by 3 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure that the formula I derived works correctly for the earlier layers. For example, a_1 should be 4. Plugging n=1 into the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For a_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. a_3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and deriving a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we compute the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a repeated pattern of 1 + 3*(...), with each layer nesting another similar expression. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer from the inside. The recurrence is:\n   - a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2\n\n3. **Find Closed-Form Solution**:\n   - The recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence.\n   - The general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n   - Using a_1 = 4, solve for C: C = 3/2.\n   - Thus, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**:\n   - For the 9th layer (a_9): a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that this structure is similar to a geometric series, but since it's nested, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a moment. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches Layer 2. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with our earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if we consider the entire expression as 3*a_9, then:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572.

The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + k*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(k^{n} -1)/(k-1) + initial term adjusted. Wait, let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. So the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9. So layer 9 would be a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I was able to compute each layer manually, it worked out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation formula, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more straightforwardly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 has five digits: 2,9,5,2,4. Let me number them as positions 5 to 1:\n\nPosition 5: 2\nPosition 4: 9\nPosition 3: 5\nPosition 2: 2\nPosition 1: 4\n\nSo, when I multiply each digit by 3:\n\n- Position 1: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Position 2: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- Position 3: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Position 4: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Position 5: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together from Position 5 to 1: 8,8,5,7,2. So the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in calculating one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, we add a new layer.\n\nLooking at the original expression, the number of layers is 9, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The first parenthesis after 3 is (1 + 3(...)), and each time it's nested, so each 1 + 3(...) is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of times I see (1 + 3(...)):\n\n1. (1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n2. Each time it's repeated. So, starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). So, yes, 9 layers. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nTherefore, the result after computing all layers is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems valid. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the formula method, we arrive at the same result, confirming that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach, and both lead to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value and use it to compute the next. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the outermost layer efficiently. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Using the derived formula for the nth layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we confirm Layer 9 as 29524.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**:  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back and verify each layer computation.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication again because 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nIs there a way to find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\nL(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L(9).\n\nThis recurrence relation can be written as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, L(9) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it using the formula.\n\nSince L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the expression is 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me confirm with another method: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem is 3 times the Layer 9, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3(...)\" terms. Each \"(\" introduces a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3(, each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's count the number of ( after the first one:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers after the initial 3. So, that means Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the one just inside the initial 3. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct because it's the 9th layer, and then I multiply by 3 to get the final answer. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a general formula.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and find a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So putting it together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions and C is a particular solution. Let me find C first. Assume a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, it's 3^{10} -1 over 2, which is correct. So, yes, 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, using the formula, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_{n}=1 + 3*a_{n-1}, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using a recursive formula and solving it, we determine that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So starting from the first 3, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 layers, each starting with 1+3(...). So I correctly calculated up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it.

Let's see.\n\nEach L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nWe know that L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, substituting n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B\n\nAlso, for n=0, if we consider L_0, it would be 1 (since it's the base case before adding 3). But let's check:\n\nIf n=0, L_0 = 1\n\nSubstituting into the general solution:\n\n1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) A + B = 1\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n2A = 3 => A = 3/2\n\nThen, from equation 2: (3/2) + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2\n\nSo the general formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =81 -1=80/2=40, which matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for our problem, we have L_9, which is n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59049, so:\n\nL_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich is exactly what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nSo, after all that, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a general formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing up to Layer 9, we find its value to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. But just to explore, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, we can set up the equation by assuming a particular solution is a constant. So, substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B \u21d2 B = 1 + 3B \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as we got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it gives the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that. Starting from the innermost layer: a_1 =1 +3=4. a_2 =1 +3*a_1=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3 +9 +27=40. Wait, that's interesting. Each a_n seems to be the sum of a geometric series. Let's see: a_1=4=3^1 +1? Wait, 3^1=3, 3+1=4. a_2=13=3^3 + 3^1 +1? Wait, 3^3=27, which is too big. Alternatively, maybe a_2=1 +3 +9=13. Yes, that's 3^0 +3^1 +3^2=1 +3 +9=13. Similarly, a_3=1 +3 +9 +27=40=3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3=40. Wait, but earlier we saw that a_3=40, which is 1 +3*13=40. So, indeed, each a_n is the sum of the first (n+1) terms of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0. Therefore, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is given by (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically, and the recurrence relation approach as well as the geometric series approach both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which resembles the form of a geometric progression. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me recall that for an expression like a + r*(a + r*(a + ...)), it forms a geometric series. In this case, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I let x be the innermost term, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent term is 1 + 3x. But since the nesting goes on, perhaps I can model it as x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4. Then, x_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, x_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, the approach is correct. Alternatively, for a general case with n layers, the value can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 + 1. Wait, let me think about that. If each layer is x_{k} = 1 + 3x_{k-1}, with x_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for x_n. The recurrence relation is x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: x_1 = A*3 + B = 4. And for n=2: x_2 = A*3^2 + B = 1 + 3x_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, x_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, x_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next. The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might make a mistake. Let me verify each layer computation again to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, which would be a simple case. Solving for x, we get x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's for an infinite series, which isn't the case here. However, since we have a finite number of layers (9 layers), maybe we can model it using a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, to find L_9, we can compute each L_n step by step as I did before. Alternatively, we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to find a pattern. Let's compute the first few layers and see if we can find a pattern or a formula. L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent L_n in terms of n. Let me see the ratio between consecutive terms: L_2 / L_1 = 13 / 4 = 3.25 L_3 / L_2 = 40 / 13 \u2248 3.0769 L_4 / L_3 = 121 / 40 = 3.025 L_5 / L_4 = 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008 L_6 / L_5 = 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000 L_7 / L_6 = 3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000 L_8 / L_7 = 9841 / 3280 \u2248 3.000 L_9 / L_8 = 29524 / 9841 \u2248 3.000 So, after L_5, the ratio approaches 3, which makes sense because each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and as n increases, the effect of the '+1' becomes negligible, so L_n \u2248 3*L_{n-1}. But for exact values, we need to compute each step. Alternatively, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n = 5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n = 6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n = 7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n = 8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n = 9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Because 3*3^{10} = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3. So, (3^{11} - 3)/2. Now, 3^{11} is 177147, because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, plugging that in: (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've thoroughly checked this, both by computing each layer step by step and by deriving a general formula for L_n, which gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 29524 *3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's exponential growth, so it might make sense. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, we can model this as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. We can try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, set this equal to the left side: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could have used the closed-form expression from the start. Since there are 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiply by 3: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a geometric progression with each term multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where n goes from 1 to 9. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) L(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) ... and so on, up to L(9). Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9). So, we can write L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation. Let's compute L(2) using the recurrence: L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the closed-form formula: L(2) = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the closed-form formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L(1) = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify the multiplication: 29524 * 3.

Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the layers seem correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe a formula or a pattern that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me explore that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say that each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recursive relation. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, which matches what I did earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I know that for such relations, there's a way to find a closed-form solution. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + r^{n} * a_0, but wait, actually, let me recall the formula correctly. The solution to a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + r^{n} * a_0, but in our case, a_0 isn't defined yet. Wait, no, our first term is a_1 = 4, so perhaps the formula is a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as:\n\na_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, each time, the value is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. This is similar to a geometric progression but with an added constant each time. The closed-form formula helps avoid computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step and then using a closed-form formula to verify, I arrived at the same answer both times, which gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication because I might have messed up the carries. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer. Let's see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then each layer outwards adds another 3(...). So from Layer 1 to Layer 9, there are 9 layers. So my earlier computation was correct up to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Which matches my earlier computation. Similarly, n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct again. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this method is more efficient and less error-prone because it uses a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. But just to be thorough, let me check with n=4 using the formula: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier result. So, confident that the formula works, I can rely on it for n=9. Thus, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form solution. The innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back step by step and verify each layer.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. In fact, this looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that would make it easier to compute for multiple layers. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. The particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, Layer9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final step is to multiply by 3: 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form formula to efficiently compute the result without manually calculating each layer. \n\nThe expression simplifies to 3 times the 9th term of a sequence defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which leads to the formula (3^{11} - 3)/2.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check the multiplication another way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Hmm, but wait, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern? It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014direct computation and using the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n________\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Write down 8.\nThere are no more digits, so the carry over 2 would be written as 2, but wait, that's not right because we've already multiplied all digits. Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the digits are 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), and 4 (units). So, when multiplying, we start from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, no carry.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, no carry.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Wait, that's 88,572. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where n goes from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. So, each term is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I started by breaking down the expression, realized it's a nested recurrence, computed each layer step by step, then derived a formula to confirm the result. It's always good to check with a different method to ensure accuracy, especially with such a long expression. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step and then apply the closed-form formula to find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, that seems correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me verify that by another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for this recursion. The recursive formula is: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1) with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and it's usually of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 1. Wait, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0, which has the solution Layer n = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Layer n = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. Wait, when I started counting, I considered Layer 1 as the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 as the outermost one. But when I computed Layer 9, it was the innermost part multiplied by 3, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should check by computing a smaller version to see if the pattern holds. Let's take a smaller version with just two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Compute this step by step: Innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 3*4=12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13=39. Alternatively, using the formula: Layer 2 = (3^(2+1) -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which is correct. Then, 3*Layer2=39, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, it's (3^10 -1)/2=29524, and 3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That might be a more efficient way to compute it, especially if there are many layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. It seems that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can also look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier computations:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. The outermost layer, after computation, is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 more carefully: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. But let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I feel like I might have missed a layer. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then inside is 1 + 3(...). How many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) instances. From the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent term is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, that should be correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. But to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, we can compute L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, if I can find a general formula for L_n, that might help. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems solid. So, I think I've got it right. The key was recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which made the computation much easier instead of calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. This way, even if there were more layers, I could still compute the value efficiently using the formula. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. The innermost value is computed and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. Using the formula for the nth layer, we determine the value of the outermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let \\( L_n \\) represent the value of the nth layer. The recurrence is \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The general solution is found to be \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: For the 9th layer, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times \\( L_9 \\), so \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 2*3=6, write 6. Wait, that seems off because 29524 has digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me confirm by another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. Then, 88048 + 500 = 88548. Then, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.

I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each step follows logically, and the numbers add up properly. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
