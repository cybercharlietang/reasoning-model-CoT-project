    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, reading it from top to bottom, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems off. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression, which could save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote a_n as the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, I could compute a_9 directly as (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the answer is the same. I think I've checked it thoroughly, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, we derive a closed-form solution.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent (1+3(...) wraps around that, so Layer 2, Layer 3, etc. Let me count how many layers there are. The expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so there are 9 layers. Wait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer. Let me list each layer's value again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when dealing with these nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each layer is correct. Then, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus any carried over? Wait, no, we're done with the digits. Wait, no, 29524 has five digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted. Let me count the digits:\n\n2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, five digits. So when multiplying, it's:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = let's compute:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly computed Layer 9 as 29524.\n\nLet me retrace the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I looked at the original expression, it was 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer), and the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step again, perhaps using a different approach, maybe looking for a pattern or a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me see if I can represent this recursively. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nL_2 =1 +3*L1=1+12=13\n\nL_3=1+3*L2=1+39=40\n\nL_4=1+3*L3=1+120=121\n\nL_5=1+3*L4=1+363=364\n\nL_6=1+3*L5=1+1092=1093\n\nL_7=1+3*L6=1+3279=3280\n\nL_8=1+3*L7=1+9840=9841\n\nL_9=1+3*L8=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent with what I had before. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n without computing each layer. Let's see. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} =1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} =1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L_n -3L_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA -3*A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4.\n\nAt n=1: L_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Yes, because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: by computing each layer step by step, by deriving a general formula using recurrence relations, and by verifying the arithmetic. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives us a formula for the nth layer, which we then use to compute the outermost expression. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but our a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me derive it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked each step, and both methods\u2014the iterative layer-by-layer approach and the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carrying over. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let's go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The initial term a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I computed before. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryover. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.

Let me compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. Wait, but 29524 has digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3: Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7.

So, the result is 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that can't be because 2*3=6 +2=8, so the ten thousands place is 8, thousands place is 7 (from 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 in thousands and carryover 2 to ten thousands), then hundreds place is 5, tens place is 7, units place is 2.

Let me check with another method: 29524*3. 29524*3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, in this problem, we're calculating up to a_9, and then multiplying by 3. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the method for such recursions. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f So the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we're computing up to a_9, and then multiplying by 3. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I think I might have messed up the carries. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nFinally, 9 (the next digit) * 3 = 27. Wait, hold on, 29524 has digits: 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me write it properly:\n\nDigits of 29524: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carryover 0.\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carryover 2.\n2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands place: 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me confirm this with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: \n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I feel like maybe I made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier. So, the 9th term is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each term is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result. So, regardless of the method, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step, and all methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each of the nine layers, we find the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Now, since there are no more digits, we're done. So the number is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let's do it another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recast the problem as a recursive expression. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40 f(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 120 = 121 f(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 363 = 364 f(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 f(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 f(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 f(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.

The original expression is 3*(...), and inside there are eight layers, right? Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me parse the expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. It's 9 times, but the innermost one is just 1+3, without another parenthesis. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, which I accounted for correctly. So, my earlier computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for the nth term. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined recursively by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps I can express L_n in terms of n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier computation. So, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and using the recurrence relation approach also led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recursive pattern, we can compute each layer step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach confirms the result. \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me just compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStart from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have:\n\nStarting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 8, 7, 7.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the multiplication should result in a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it as 29,524.\n\nMultiplying 29,524 by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 87,572.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29,524 * 3 should be 88,572. Wait, let me compute it properly:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo, it's 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572 because 30,000 *3=90,000, so 29,524 is 476 less, so 90,000 - (476*3)=90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Yes, that makes sense. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29,524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, is that the final answer? Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, each layer seems correct.

By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

Then 3*29,524 is 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which would allow me to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 29,524\n\nI notice that each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 4 times the previous term minus something. Let me check:\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 to 13. 4*3 +1=13? 4*3=12 +1=13. Hmm, maybe.\n\nFrom Layer 2 to Layer 3: 13*3 +1=40? 13*3=39 +1=40.

So, the general formula for Layer n is 3*(Layer n-1) +1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, let's check with Layer 1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so this formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nThus, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2,187\n\n3^8=6,561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\n3^{10}=59,049\n\nThus, Layer 9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 =88,572.\n\nSo, that's the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^{10}=59,049\n\n3^{11}=59,049*3=177,147\n\nThus, (177,147 -3)/2 =177,144/2=88,572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows us to derive a formula, confirming each step's correctness. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 yields the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss any layers. I started with Layer 1 as 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed up to Layer 9, which was 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n, which might help verify my result. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, for n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I had to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I would have had to compute each layer step by step, which I did initially. But knowing the recurrence relation and solving it provides a quicker way, especially if the number of layers were larger. However, in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my initial step-by-step computation. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. All steps check out. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've covered all the steps and verified my work, so I don't see any mistakes. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down one by one helped. I also liked how recognizing the recurrence relation gave me a quicker way to compute the innermost layers without having to calculate each step manually. It's interesting how different approaches can lead to the same solution. I guess practice makes perfect, and being able to spot patterns like this can save a lot of time in the future. Anyway, I think I'm done here. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I messed up the places. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nWait, that's actually not correct because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, I should have:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1.\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, the digits are: ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units.\n\nSo, multiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nUnits: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\nTens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\nHundreds: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\nThousands: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\nTen thousands: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nWait, but that's only 5 digits. So the result is 88572? Wait, 29524*3: Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, so units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, tens digit is 7.\n5*3=15, so hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, ten thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572. Wait, but 29524 *3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me check that because I think I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...). So let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each additional 1+3 adds another layer.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers of 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, in total, the innermost is Layer1: 1+3=4\n\nThen Layer2: 1+3*Layer1=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen the outermost is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me make sure that I have 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+\" terms:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, it's another 1+3. So, how many 1+3 terms are there?\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each time we add another 1+3. Let me count the number of \"1+\" in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3:\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until:\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 1+3(...), each one nested inside the previous. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer9, that's correct, and then the outermost 3*(Layer9)=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I computed Layer9, I got 29524, but let me check that again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again because sometimes even after careful computation, mistakes can happen.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1, L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2, L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3, L3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nTherefore, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since the problem only had 9 layers, computing each step manually was manageable, but knowing the formula is helpful for future problems.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step until we reach the outermost layer, then multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Maybe I should compute it as 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So reading from top: 2,7,8,7,2, but wait, let me check again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, is that correct? Let me verify: 30000 * 3 = 90000, 476 *3=1428, so 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. So the number is 7 digits: 7, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is 5 digits, so 29524 *3 should be 5 digits *3, which is up to 6 digits.

Write down 8.\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that's 88572. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So the final answer would be 88572. Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L9. This looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. The general form is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear non-homogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume Ln = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrived at the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is building up a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, the expression is essentially 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). Wait, no, because L9 is (3^10 -1)/2, so 3*L9 would be 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to see it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach gave me the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows a geometric progression. The solution is found to be:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), right? So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2:1+3*4=13, Layer 3:1+3*13=40, Layer 4:1+3*40=121, Layer 5:1+3*121=364, Layer 6:1+3*364=1093, Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's denote a_n = Layer n. Then, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can look for the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive formula approach confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward and using a recursive approach, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed with a formula.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing quite rapidly. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could help confirm this result without computing each layer manually. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive formula approach backed up the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So putting it all together: 6 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 *3 is actually 88572. Let me check that again. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.

So the digits are 7, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number.

Wait, but that's only 5 digits, but 29524 \u00d73 is indeed 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But let me verify this because I might have miscalculated earlier steps. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw before, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K = 1 + 3K \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.

    "text": " 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. 0*3=0. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, that's what I got before. So that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me just verify all the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in my layers, a_1 is 4, a_2 is 13, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall: For a recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Wait, more precisely, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Alternatively, the closed-form formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - (c)/(1 - r). Hmm, maybe I can use that to compute the 9th term directly instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try that. In this case, c = 1, r = 3. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each inner term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, if I expand the entire expression, it's like 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but I need to check. Wait, actually, let me think about it. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, when you expand it, each layer contributes a term of 3^k where k is the number of layers from the innermost. Wait, perhaps it's similar to a geometric series but with a different starting point. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and the first term is 4, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous. So, when we expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, let me try to write it out step by step. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me see how many 3's there are. Each layer adds another 3, so there are 9 layers, each contributing a multiplication by 3. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3. So, when I expand E, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). So, each time, it's like adding another 3. So, if I expand E, it would be 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, let me check that. Let me take a smaller example. Suppose I have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Then, innermost is 1 + 3 =4. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*4 =13. Then, E=3*13=39. Alternatively, if I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(13)=39. Alternatively, if I expand without nesting, it's 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 =3 +9 +27=39. So, in this case, E=3 +3^2 +3^3=3+9+27=39. Similarly, if I have one more layer: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))). Innermost:1+3=4. Next:1+3*4=13. Next:1+3*13=40. Then E=3*40=120. Alternatively, expanding:3 +3^2 +3^3 +3^4=3+9+27+81=120. So, yes, in general, E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with n layers is equal to the sum from k=1 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but in the first example, n=3:3^1 +3^2 +3^3=3+9+27=39, which matches. Similarly, n=4:3+9+27+81=120, which matches. So, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Starting after the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses: (1 +3(...)), so n=9. Therefore, E= sum from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series from k=1 to n of 3^k is (3^(n+1) -3)/ (3 -1)= (3^(n+1)-3)/2. So, for n=9, sum= (3^10 -3)/2= (59049 -3)/2=59046/2=29523. Then, E=3*sum=3*29523=88569. Wait, but earlier I got 88572. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Which one is correct? Let me check. Wait, in the smaller example, when n=3: sum=3+9+27=39, which is (3^4 -3)/2=(81-3)/2=78/2=39. Correct. Similarly, for n=4: sum=3+9+27+81=120=(3^5 -3)/2=(243-3)/2=240/2=120. Correct. So, for n=9, sum=(3^10 -3)/2=59046/2=29523. Then, E=3*29523=88569. But earlier, when I computed layer by layer, I got E=88572. There's a difference of 3. So, which is correct? Let me check my layer-by-layer computation again. Wait, in the layer-by-layer approach, I had Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, E=3*29524=88572. But according to the geometric series approach, E=3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k)=3*(29523)=88569. So, which one is correct? There must be a mistake somewhere. Let me see. Wait, in the geometric series approach, the sum is from k=1 to 9 of 3^k, which is 3+9+27+81+243+729+2187+6561+19683= let's compute that: 3+9=12, +27=39, +81=120, +243=363, +729=1092, +2187=3279, +6561=9840, +19683=29523. So, sum=29523. Then, E=3*29523=88569. But in the layer-by-layer approach, I got E=88572. So, there's a discrepancy of 3. Therefore, one of the approaches is wrong. Let me see where. In the layer-by-layer approach, I had Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, Layer4=121, Layer5=364, Layer6=1093, Layer7=3280, Layer8=9841, Layer9=29524. Then, E=3*29524=88572. But according to the geometric series, it's 88569. So, which is correct? Let me check the layer-by-layer computation again. Let me recompute each layer step by step to see if I made a mistake. Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer9=29524. Then, E=3*29524=88572. But according to the geometric series, E=88569. So, why the difference? Wait, perhaps the geometric series approach is missing something. Because in the layer-by-layer approach, each layer is 1 +3*previous, which is not exactly the same as summing 3^k. Wait, in the geometric series approach, I assumed that E= sum from k=1 to n of 3^k, but in reality, each layer adds a 1, so the total sum is actually different. Let me think again. When I have E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ...))), each inner term is 1 +3*something. So, when I expand it, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ...)))=3*1 +3*3*(1 +3*(1 + ...))=3 +9*(1 +3*(1 + ...))=3 +9 +27*(1 +3*(1 + ...)) and so on. So, actually, the expansion is 3 + 3^2 +3^3 + ... +3^9 +3^10*(1). Wait, no, because the innermost term is 1 +3, which is 4, and then each layer adds another 3*something. Wait, perhaps the total sum is 3 +3^2 +3^3 + ... +3^9 +3^10. Because when you expand the entire expression, you end up with 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...)))=3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^10. Let me check with the smaller example where n=3: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39. Alternatively, expanding:3 +3^2 +3^3 +3^4=3+9+27+81=120. Wait, but that's not matching the smaller example. Wait, in the smaller example with n=3 layers, E=39, but the sum from k=1 to 4 of 3^k is 3+9+27+81=120, which is different. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, let me think of the expression as E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost term is 1 +3=4, then each layer adds another 3*previous. So, the total expression can be thought of as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3))))). So, each layer adds a term of 3^k, starting from k=1 up to k=9, but multiplied by 3 at each step. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as E=3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^9 +3^10. Let me see. Let me take the smaller example with n=2: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39. Alternatively, if I think of it as 3 +3^2 +3^3=3+9+27=39. So, that works. Similarly, for n=1: E=3*(1 +3)=3*4=12, which is 3 +3^2=3+9=12. Wait, so for n layers, the sum is from k=1 to k=n+1 of 3^k. Because in the n=1 case, sum=3+9=12, which is k=1 to 2. Similarly, for n=2, sum=3+9+27=39, which is k=1 to 3. So, in general, for n layers, the sum is from k=1 to k=n+1 of 3^k. Therefore, in our problem, n=9 layers, so the sum is from k=1 to k=10 of 3^k. So, sum= (3^11 -3)/ (3 -1)= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches the layer-by-layer computation. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. So, where did I go wrong with the geometric series approach earlier? I think I miscounted the number of terms. Because each layer adds another power of 3, so for n layers, you have n+1 powers. Therefore, for n=9 layers, sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k= (3^11 -3)/2=88572. Therefore, E=3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k + something). Wait, no, actually, the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k is the total, but in our case, E=3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k + ...). Wait, no, actually, in the layer-by-layer approach, we have Layer1=4=3^1 +1, Layer2=13=3^2 +3 +1, Layer3=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1, etc. Wait, no, that's not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps the total sum is indeed the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k, which is 88572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and moving outward, we compute each layer until we reach the outermost one. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2:13 Layer 3:40 Layer 4:121 Layer 5:364 Layer 6:1093 Layer 7:3280 Layer 8:9841 Layer 9:29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to verify. Let me think: Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the innermost layer (n=1), this gives 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Repeating this process up to the ninth layer, we find the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my computations again because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 (correct)\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3, which gives 88,572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" sections. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, each layer is one more. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers, right? Because each time you have a new layer until you reach the outermost 3(...). So, Layer 1: innermost 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: next one: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it another way. Maybe using a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 ... and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution. Let's find the particular solution. Assume L_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, but our L_n are positive integers, so maybe this approach isn't the best here. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the solution as L_n = (L_1*3^{n-1} + 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, this confirms that the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3 again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step. Using the formula for the nth layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). So, I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, I might think about whether this sequence is related to a geometric series or some other known sequence. Let's see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is a function of the previous one. Let me define a recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. I wonder if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which confirms that the earlier step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this pattern, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods lead to the same result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n2. Multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's recompute each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. Let me write out the general formula for such a sequence. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Subtract 3B: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049.

Okay, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D =1 => D= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the formula for such a recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series to find a formula, which might help verify my result. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let's check this formula with the values we calculated earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let's find B by assuming steady-state. If L_n approaches a constant as n increases, then L_n = L_{n-1} = L. So, L = 3L +1 => L -3L=1 => -2L=1 => L= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2= (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: L_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. So the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That makes me confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth layer, \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we compute the 9th layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)} \\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error when multiplying large numbers, especially with multiple carries.\n\nLet me verify 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nThere are no more digits, so the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, to recap, I started by computing the innermost parentheses, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88,572.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet's define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built using the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but I might be misremembering the exact formula. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nLet me try to solve it. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3*B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, let's check the indexing. If n=1 corresponds to a_1 = 4, then:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for each layer, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since the original expression has nine layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). Therefore, layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the value without having to compute each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, each layer adds a term that is 3^n. Let me try to expand the expression:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to write this out step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute the innermost part first: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*13=40.\n\nThen:1 +3*40=121.\n\nThen:1 +3*121=364.\n\nThen:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nThen:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nThen:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nThen:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, finally: E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then after computing a_9, we multiply by 3.\n\nBut I think I've verified it enough times now. The answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll try computing a few layers using the formula to cross-verify.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a formula involving powers of 3. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, that seems correct. But maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or a formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the form of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the formula for a linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But since the problem had 9 layers, both methods work. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, reading from left to right, the result is 88572.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series. Let me try to model it. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a*r^{n} + b, where a and b are constants to be determined. Let's assume L_n = a*3^{n} + b. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => a*3^{n} + b = 1 + 3*(a*3^{n-1} + b) => a*3^{n} + b = 1 + a*3^{n} + 3b. Subtract a*3^{n} from both sides: b = 1 + 3b => b - 3b = 1 => -2b = 1 => b = -1/2. So, L_n = a*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, let's use the initial condition to find a. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = a*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3a - 1/2 => 3a = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => a = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Let me check: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 +3, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I calculated earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 =88572, as I found before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using the formula without computing each layer. Since the expression is 3*(Layer9) and Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, as both the step-by-step layer approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carried) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carried) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 only has five digits, so after the 2, we're done. Wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nTens: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nHundreds:5\u00d73=15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\nThousands:9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\nTen thousands:2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. 29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the nested structure, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as computed earlier. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9= 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that 88572 is indeed the correct answer. I think I've thoroughly checked this, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 778572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 can't be 778572 because 30000 * 3 is 90000, and 29524 is less than 30000, so 29524 * 3 should be less than 90000, but 778572 is way larger.

Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since it's a small number of terms (9 layers), it's easier to compute each step manually as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*(3)^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is essentially multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then solving the recurrence as above gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent as well. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula for the geometric series, I end up with the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such recursions. The general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1). Let me check that. Wait, no, actually, the standard form for a linear recurrence like L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is a bit different. Let me think. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = C*b^n, and the particular solution would be a constant if a is a constant. Let me set L_n = C*b^n + K, where K is a constant particular solution. Plugging into the recurrence: C*b^{n} + K = a + b*(C*b^{n-1} + K). Simplify: C*b^n + K = a + b*C*b^{n-1} + b*K => C*b^n + K = a + C*b^n + b*K. Subtract C*b^n from both sides: K = a + b*K => K - b*K = a => K*(1 - b) = a => K = a/(1 - b). But in our case, a = 1 and b = 3, so K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form expression, I end up with the same result. That makes me feel pretty confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify one more time. Let's compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 Layer 3:1 +3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, everything checks out. I think I've got the right answer here. No need to second-guess myself anymore. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and verifying with the formula helped solidify that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the value at each layer follows the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives \\(L_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4. So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long chain. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate anywhere. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would work. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the layers are a_1, a_2, ..., a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. The problem is to compute 3*a_9. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
