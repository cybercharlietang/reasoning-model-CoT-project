Therefore, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1 Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final value is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer sequentially, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.

Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

But since the problem only has 9 layers, computing step by step is also feasible. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this result now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next nested term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
