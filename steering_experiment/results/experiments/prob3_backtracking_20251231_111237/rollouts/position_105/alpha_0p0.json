    "text": " 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let me see if I can express E in terms of itself. Wait, but each layer is similar, so perhaps I can find a relationship where E relates to a smaller version of itself. However, since the nesting is finite (nine layers), it's easier to compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation as I did before. The geometric series approach might not be as straightforward here because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, so it's more of a linear recurrence than a simple geometric series. Therefore, the step-by-step computation or solving the recurrence relation seems the most straightforward methods. In any case, whether I compute each layer manually or use the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572. So, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, each layer a_n can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since it's only 9 layers, step-by-step computation is feasible. I think I've double-checked it enough. The answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but with an added constant. But since I already have the closed-form expression, I can use that to compute the result without computing each layer step by step. But either way, both methods lead to the same result.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Then layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13.

    "text": " 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.

Alternatively, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So each layer is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then adds 1.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computations.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.
