    "text": " Maybe I should start solving from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and then work my way outwards. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost: Let's denote each level as Level 1 to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1 result). So, Level 2: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, so Level 2 is 13. Moving on to Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Level 3 is 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 4 is 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*120 is 360, so 3*121 is 363. Plus 1 is 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 which is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating that, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9 result), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down differently would be better. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it together, it's 88572. Wait, let me verify that again because I might have messed up the carryover. Let me write it out:\n\n    29524\n  x    3\n  -------\n  \nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, no carryover.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. Okay, that seems right.\n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each level to ensure I didn't make an error in any step.\n\nStarting from Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000 + 279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000 + 840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 + 3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 29524*3=88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but 88572 seems quite large. Maybe I should check if I counted the levels correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the first parenthesis after 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new level. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 levels because each time we have a new \"1+3(\".\n\nYes, so I did 9 levels correctly. So the calculation seems correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems too big. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, maybe a geometric series or something. Let me think about it.\n\nEach level can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but our a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I need to adjust the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the RHS is a constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for a_1, n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works.\n\nThus, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more because I want to be absolutely sure. Maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if the approach is correct.\n\nFor example, let's compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). According to my method:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Then 3*40=120.\n\nLet me compute it manually: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works for a smaller version, which gives me more confidence.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution to the original problem is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost level (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe it's easier if I assign each nested part a variable or a step. Let me try evaluating the innermost parentheses first. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the next layer out would be 3 times that result plus 1. Wait, no, let me check. The next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, starting from the innermost: Step 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3). That's 4. Step 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from Step 1)). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Step 3: Next layer out is again (1 + 3*(result from Step 2)). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Step 4: Continuing outward, it's (1 + 3*(result from Step 3)). So, 1 + 3*40. Calculating: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Step 5: Next, (1 + 3*(result from Step 4)). So, 1 + 3*121. Let's see: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Step 6: Moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*(result from Step 5)). So, 1 + 3*364. Calculating: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Step 7: Next layer, (1 + 3*(result from Step 6)). So, 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute that: 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Step 8: Continuing outward, (1 + 3*(result from Step 7)). So, 1 + 3*3280. Calculating: 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Step 9: Next layer, (1 + 3*(result from Step 8)). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me do that: 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, after computing all nine layers, the innermost parentheses worked out to 4, and each subsequent layer built on that, leading up to 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is to compute 3*(29524). Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me break this down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go back through each step quickly: Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this process quicker in the future. Let me see: Each step, we're computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I denote each step as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the 9th term, which is a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9 =3*(29524)=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each step manually or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. I think I'm confident that 88572 is correct. Let me just recap the steps in case I missed something: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. 2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). 3. Compute each layer step by step until reaching the outermost parentheses. 4. Multiply the final result by 3. 5. Alternatively, recognize the recurrence relation and compute using the formula. Both methods led to the same result, so I think I'm solid here. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By iteratively solving each layer, the final result is found to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost. Let's define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, I can build up to Layer 9 and then multiply by 3. That sounds manageable.

Let me compute that. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.

Let's go through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define L(n) as the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L(1) = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's find another equation. Let's compute L(2) using the recurrence: L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the closed-form: L(2) = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2).\n\nSo the closed-form is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L(3) = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I can compute each layer without having to compute each step, which is helpful, especially if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing step by step was manageable.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to recognize that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*(previous) + 1. That's exactly what I did earlier, so it's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the final result is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the next inner layer. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute the value step by step. Recognizing the pattern allows us to use a recurrence relation or a closed-form formula to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, when I look closely, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...) term. So maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try to write each step as I compute from the inside out. Let's start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let me denote each innermost expression as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me check: The innermost expression is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps another 1 + 3 around it. So, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then we have 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems correct. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution.

So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSo Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, actually, perhaps a better way is to compute it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nMultiply each digit by 3, starting from the right.\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, maybe I should do it more carefully.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12.

Okay, that matches, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 through 9. So, layer 1 is the innermost: (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(result of layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(result of layer 2), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost. So, maybe I can compute each layer starting from layer 1 and build up the result. Let's try that. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. So, layer 1 result is 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, layer 2 result is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, layer 3 result is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 result is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, layer 5 result is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, layer 6 result is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 result is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 result is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Wait, let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the result of layer n as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to see this. Let me think about expanding the entire expression. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so perhaps it's a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me denote the innermost expression as x_1 = 1 + 3. Then, the next one is x_2 = 1 + 3*x_1. Then, x_3 = 1 + 3*x_2, and so on, up to x_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9. As we saw earlier, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps we can see the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding it without substituting variables. Let me write the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to distribute the 3s step by step. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, finally, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe we can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Each time we have 1 + 3*(something). If I expand each multiplication, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum. Let me try that. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me define E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. E_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. E_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. E_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, E = 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of each step as a geometric progression. Let me try to see if I can express E in terms of a sum. Let's see, starting from the innermost term, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me try to expand E_9. E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_7) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*E_7. Continuing this way, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, expanding E_9: E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_7) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E_7. Similarly, E_7 = 1 + 3*E_6, so substituting back: E_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*E_6). Continuing this expansion, each time we add another term. So, after expanding all the way, E_9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*E_1. But E_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. Wait, that might complicate things, but perhaps I can see a pattern here. Alternatively, considering that each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, and E_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. Then, E_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. E_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. As we saw earlier, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*E_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that. Let's expand E step by step, but this time, let's distribute each multiplication and see if we can express E as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Starting with the innermost term: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Then: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, again, same result. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where each layer is a multiple of 3 plus 1, leading to a geometric progression. Let me think about the sum. Each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(previous term). If I expand this recursively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that. Let me consider E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8. Then, E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7, so substituting back: E_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_7) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E_7. Similarly, E_7 = 1 + 3*E_6, so E_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*E_6) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*E_6. Continuing this way, each time we substitute E_{n} = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, we add another term. So, after expanding all the way, E_9 would be equal to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*E_1. Now, E_1 is (1 + 3) = 4. So, E_9 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*4. Let me compute that. The sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is a geometric series with ratio 3, 9 terms. The sum S = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, 3^9*4 = 19683*4 = 78732. So, E_9 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573. Wait, that's different from the previous result of 29524. That can't be right. Wait, I must have made a mistake here. Let me check. Wait, E_9 is equal to sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*E_1. But E_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. So, E_9 = (sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) + 3^9*(1 + 3). Let me compute that again. Sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, 3^9*(1 + 3) = 19683*4 = 78732. So, E_9 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573. Wait, but earlier, I had E_9 = 29524. That's a discrepancy. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check my earlier calculations. When I computed E_9 as (3^{10} - 1)/2, that gave me 29524. But according to this expansion, E_9 is 88573. Clearly, one of these is incorrect. Let me go back to the definition. Wait, E_9 is defined as 1 + 3*E_8. But in this expansion, I considered E_9 as sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*E_1. But perhaps I misapplied the expansion. Let me try again. Let me write E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8. Similarly, E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7, so E_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_7) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E_7. Continuing this way, E_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*E_6. And so on, until E_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8*E_1. Since E_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, so E_9 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*(1 + 3). So, that's sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is 9841, plus 3^9*(1 + 3) = 19683*4 = 78732. So, total E_9 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573. But earlier, using the recurrence relation, I found E_9 = 29524. There's a conflict here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me check the recurrence relation approach again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, according to this, E_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 88572. But according to the expansion approach, E_9 = 88573. That's off by 1. Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me check the expansion again. Let me write E_9 as follows: E_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1s and the number of 3s when expanding. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me try expanding E_9 step by step, writing out each term. E_9 = 1 + 3*(E_8). E_8 = 1 + 3*(E_7). E_7 = 1 + 3*(E_6). E_6 = 1 + 3*(E_5). E_5 = 1 + 3*(E_4). E_4 = 1 + 3*(E_3). E_3 = 1 + 3*(E_2). E_2 = 1 + 3*(E_1). E_1 = 1 + 3. So, E_1 = 4. E_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. E_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. E_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. E_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. E_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. E_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. E_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. E_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, according to this, E_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 88572. Now, in the expansion approach, I tried to express E_9 as a sum of powers of 3 plus 3^9*(E_1). But perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me try again. Let me expand E_9 step by step, expressing each substitution:\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8  \nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7  \nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6  \nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5  \nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4  \nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3  \nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2  \nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1  \nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, substituting back, we get:\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, E_9 = 29524. Now, when I tried to express E_9 as a sum, I think I may have miscalculated the number of terms. Let me try again. Let me write E_9 as:\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count how many 1s and 3s there are when I expand this. Each time, we have a 1 and a multiplication by 3. Since there are 9 layers, starting from the innermost, each layer adds a 1 and a 3. So, when fully expanded, E_9 would be equal to:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich, when expanded, would be:\n\n1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1 + 3^9*(1 + 3).\n\nWait, that's 9 terms of 1 multiplied by 3^k for k from 0 to 8, plus 3^9*(1 + 3). So, that's sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*(1 + 3). Let me compute that:\n\nsum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, 3^9*(1 + 3) = 19683*4 = 78732.\n\nSo, total E_9 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573.\n\nBut wait, that's not matching the earlier result of 29524. So, where is the mistake? Let me check the substitution again. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing E_9 with the entire expression. Wait, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(E_9). So, if E_9 is 29524, then 3*E_9 = 88572. But in the expansion approach, I calculated E_9 as 88573, which is off by 1. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me try to expand E_9 manually, step by step, to see what it equals.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))  \n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)))))))  \n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)))))))  \n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*13))))))  \n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*40))))))  \n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*121))))))  \n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*364))))))  \n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1093))))))  \n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*3280))))))  \n= 1 + 3*(1 + 9840)))))  \n= 1 + 3*9841  \n= 1 + 29523  \n= 29524.\n\nSo, E_9 is indeed 29524, as previously calculated. Therefore, the expansion approach where I thought E_9 was 88573 must be incorrect. Let me see where I went wrong in that approach. I think I confused E_9 with the entire expression. The entire expression is 3*E_9, so when I expanded E_9, I should have stopped at E_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, the expansion approach was trying to compute E_9 as a sum, but perhaps I miscounted the number of terms or misapplied the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion approach isn't the right way to go, and the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward. Since both the step-by-step calculation and the recurrence relation give me E_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, I can be confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, after carefully working through the problem step by step, checking each layer, and verifying with a recurrence relation, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me see if I can represent this as a series of nested expressions. Let's denote each inner expression as a separate term. Maybe I can define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me try to define it recursively. Let's say that each innermost expression is of the form 1 + 3*something. So, if I start from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, then the next one would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. So perhaps I can define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent a_n would be building upon the previous one. That might work. Let me try that approach. So, starting from the innermost part: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer would be a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, let's continue this way. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, so if I'm following this correctly, each a_n is being calculated as 1 + 3 times the previous a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4, and going up to a_9 = 29524. Now, looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3 times the first a_9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, no, actually, in the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, perhaps the first a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 is 1 + 3*a_1, which is 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to a_9, which would be 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*29524. Let me check that again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, each time, you have 1 + 3*next. So, if I have a_9, that's the innermost part, and each layer above is 1 + 3*the next inner layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Wait, but in my previous calculation, a_9 was 29524, so then the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's calculate that. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the a_n calculations. Let me go through each a_n step by step again to confirm. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each a_n is correct. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them again. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first, then each next layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are nine layers. So, a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me try to compute the expression step by step without using the a_n notation, just to confirm. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, calculating each nested term step by step.

    "text": " Maybe each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. So, (1 + 3) equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from the innermost)). So, replacing the innermost part, the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have another (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Continuing this way, each time I compute a layer, I can move outward. Let me try to tabulate this to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, let me check. So, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and adds 1. So starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, I think I did nine layers, right? Because the original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). Let me recount the layers:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and layer 9 is the one just before the final multiplication by 3. So, the final step is to multiply this result by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Let me check one more time, perhaps using another method. Maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these repeated operations can be expressed as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure: each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost term, which is 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, a_1 is (1 + 3) = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might be quicker than computing each step manually. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, which is what I did initially, but having a formula is nice because it can save time, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Since there are nine such layers, we can model this with the recurrence relation and find that the value before the final multiplication is 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives us 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value before the final multiplication by 3. Using the recurrence relation approach, we determine that the value before the final step is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe each layer is a similar expression, so perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's denote each layer as follows: Let me label each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E9 is the innermost one. So, E9 = 1 + 3. Then E8 = 1 + 3*E9, E7 = 1 + 3*E8, and so on, until E1 = 1 + 3*E2, and the entire expression is 3*E1. So, to make it clearer, I can write each step as:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3  \nE8 = 1 + 3*E9  \nE7 = 1 + 3*E8  \nE6 = 1 + 3*E7  \nE5 = 1 + 3*E6  \nE4 = 1 + 3*E5  \nE3 = 1 + 3*E4  \nE2 = 1 + 3*E3  \nE1 = 1 + 3*E2  \nResult = 3*E1\n\nSo, I need to compute E9 first, then E8 using E9, then E7 using E8, and so on, until I get to E1, and then multiply that by 3. Let's start computing each E from E9 to E1 step by step.\n\nStarting with E9:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3  \nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, E9 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to E8:\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E9  \nWe know E9 is 4, so substitute that in:\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*4  \n3*4 is 12, so E8 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, E7:\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8  \nE8 is 13, so:\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*13  \n3*13 is 39, so E7 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nProceeding to E6:\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E7  \nE7 is 40, so:\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*40  \n3*40 is 120, so E6 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nMoving on to E5:\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E6  \nE6 is 121, so:\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121  \n3*121 is 363, so E5 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext, E4:\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E5  \nE5 is 364, so:\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*364  \n3*364 is 1092, so E4 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nProceeding to E3:\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E4  \nE4 is 1093, so:\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*1093  \n3*1093 is 3279, so E3 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nMoving on to E2:\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3  \nE3 is 3280, so:\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*3280  \n3*3280 is 9840, so E2 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nFinally, E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2  \nE2 is 9841, so:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*9841  \n3*9841 is 29523, so E1 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E1, so:\n\nResult = 3*E1 = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000  \nThen, 3*9000 = 27000  \nNext, 3*500 = 1500  \nThen, 3*24 = 72  \nNow, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me check that multiplication again because 3*29524 seems like a big number, but I think my step-by-step might have an error. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.  \n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.  \n9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.  \n2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.  \nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 = 4  \nE8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nE7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nE6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nE4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nE3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nE2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nE1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \nResult = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, each step seems correct. I can also see a pattern here where each E is following a certain growth. Let me see if there's a formula or a pattern that could have helped me compute this without calculating each step, just to verify.\n\nLooking at the expressions:\n\nE9 = 4  \nE8 = 13  \nE7 = 40  \nE6 = 121  \nE5 = 364  \nE4 = 1093  \nE3 = 3280  \nE2 = 9841  \nE1 = 29524  \nResult = 88572\n\nWait, let's see if each E follows a recurrence relation. Each E is defined as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, starting from E9.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series, but with a twist because each term depends on the next one. Let me try to model this recurrence relation.\n\nLet me consider the general case where each term is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, with E_{n+9} = 1 + 3*E_{n+10}, but that might get too abstract. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a linear recurrence.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Suppose I have a recurrence relation where each term is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, and we have 9 such terms. So, starting from E9, each term is defined in terms of the next one. So, if I unroll this, I can express E9 in terms of E10, E8 in terms of E9, etc., but in our case, E9 is the innermost term, so E9 is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent term depends on the previous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to express E1 in terms of E9.\n\nStarting from E9:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3  \nE8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9  \nE7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27  \nContinuing this way, each E is 1 + 3*(previous E), which seems to expand into 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... up to some terms.\n\nWait, if I keep expanding, each E is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous, plus 1 each time. But perhaps more accurately, each E is the sum of 3^k for k from 0 to some n, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me see. Let's take E9 first:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1? No, 3^1 is 3, plus 1 is 4, yes.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's see if that's 1 + 3 + 9 + something. 1 + 3 + 9 is 13, yes. So E8 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Let's check: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Yes, that's correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Now, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, E5 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Let's see: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364. Yes, because 243 is 3^5, and adding up to 3^5 gives 364.\n\nSo, each E is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}, where n increases by 1 each time we go up a layer. So, E9 is sum up to 3^1, E8 up to 3^2, E7 up to 3^3, etc.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, starting from E9, which is sum up to 3^1, then E8 is sum up to 3^2, and so on, until E1 is sum up to 3^9.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nE9: sum up to 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \nE8: sum up to 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13  \nE7: sum up to 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40  \nE6: sum up to 3^4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121  \nE5: sum up to 3^5 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364  \nE4: sum up to 3^6 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 = 1093  \nE3: sum up to 3^7 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 = 3280  \nE2: sum up to 3^8 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 = 9841  \nE1: sum up to 3^9 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683 = 29524\n\nWait, that's exactly what we got earlier. So, each E_n is the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 up to 3^{n-1} where n is the number of terms. But in our case, E9 is the innermost with two terms (3^0 + 3^1), E8 has three terms (3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2), and so on, up to E1 which has 10 terms (3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^9).\n\nWait, actually, the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 to 3^{k} is (3^{k+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) ) = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for E9, which is sum up to 3^1, k=1, so sum is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, E8 is sum up to 3^2, so k=2, sum is (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nE7 is sum up to 3^3, so k=3, sum is (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct.\n\nSo, in general, E_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, where n is the exponent corresponding to the number of terms.\n\nWait, but in our case, E9 corresponds to sum up to 3^1, which is (3^2 -1)/2 = 4, so perhaps the exponent is one less than the number of terms. Let me check:\n\nNumber of terms in E9: 2 terms (0 and 1 exponents), so k=1, sum is (3^{2} -1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, E8 has 3 terms, so k=2, sum is (3^{3} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for E1, which is the outermost, it's the sum up to 3^9, which is k=9, so E1 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation of E1.\n\nSo, E1 = 29524, and the result is 3*E1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the geometric series formula, we can compute each E_n as (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, where k is the number of terms minus one. This seems to hold for each step, so maybe we could have computed E1 directly using the formula without expanding each step.\n\nBut since we've already computed it step by step and got E1 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems solid.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1  \n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7  \n5*3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1  \n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2  \n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8  \nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that also checks out.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying using the geometric series formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, let's see: after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each time, inside another (1 + 3(...)). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then moving out, each time adding another 1 + 3. So, maybe there are nine layers? Wait, no, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). So, each time, the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first one is 3*(1 + 3*(...), then inside that, another (1 + 3*(...), and so on. Let me count: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). So, from the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each with a 1 + 3*(...). So, that means there are 9 layers of nesting. Therefore, I need to compute starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, perhaps I can compute this step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in counting the layers. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many times I see \"1+3\" inside the parentheses. Let's see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3. Then, moving out, each time it's 1+3*(...). So, how many times does \"1+3\" appear? Let me count: from the innermost, which is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. Let me count the number of \"1+3\" terms. Let's see: the innermost is 1+3 (that's one). Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3. So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3\" appears. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the first 3 is followed by 9 opening parentheses, each with a 1+3. So, that means there are 9 layers. Therefore, L1 to L9, as I did before. So, my previous calculation was correct. So, L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9)=3*29524=88572. But wait, let me verify this with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as before. Now, the recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L3=40. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm this once more because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to miscount. Let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (3^10 -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step again to ensure I didn't make any multiplication errors.

Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost. So, Level 1: 1 + 3. Then Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1). Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2), and so on, up to Level 9. That might be a systematic way to approach it. Let me try that. So, starting with Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Level 2 is 13. Moving on to Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Level 3 is 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So Level 4 is 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3. So 300+60+3=363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So the total value of the expression is 88572.

Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should count how many times 3 is multiplied by something. Let me try to parse this step by step. Starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, the next layer is 3 times that result. Let me try to substitute each layer one by one. Let's denote each layer as follows: Let me think. Maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1. Then, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9. Then, the entire expression would be 3*a9. So, if I can compute a1 through a9, then multiply the last one by 3, that should give me the result. Let me try that. So, a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Continuing, a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next, a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then, a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Continuing, a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*a9, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the result should be 88572. Wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from a1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. a2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. a3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. a4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. a5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. a6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. a7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. a8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. a9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*a9: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. Let me expand the first few terms: a1 = 4. a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant. Let me assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to make sure. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving outward: 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 =13. Next layer: 3*(13)=39, then 1 +39=40. Next: 3*40=120, 1 +120=121. Next: 3*121=363, 1 +363=364. Next: 3*364=1092, 1 +1092=1093. Next: 3*1093=3279, 1 +3279=3280. Next: 3*3280=9840, 1 +9840=9841. Next: 3*9841=29523, 1 +29523=29524. Then, finally, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014using the recursive step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula\u2014give me the same result.

    "text": " Let me try to count the number of 3s. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a term in parentheses, and each of those terms is similar. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try to start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 equals 12. Then, the next layer is 1 + that 12. So, 1 + 12 is 13. Then, the next layer is 3 times 13, which is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Then, 3 times 40 is 120. 1 + 120 is 121. 3 times 121 is 363. 1 + 363 is 364. 3 times 364 is 1092. 1 + 1092 is 1093. 3 times 1093 is 3279. 1 + 3279 is 3280. Now, the outermost layer is 3 times 3280, which is 9840. Wait, but let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me write each step down more carefully to avoid mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 3 * 4 = 12 Layer 3: 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 4: 3 * 13 = 39 Layer 5: 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 6: 3 * 40 = 120 Layer 7: 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 8: 3 * 121 = 363 Layer 9: 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 10: 3 * 364 = 1092 Layer 11: 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 12: 3 * 1093 = 3279 Layer 13: 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 14: 3 * 3280 = 9840 Hmm, but wait, the original expression is 3 times a sum that has 9 layers of parentheses. So maybe I only need to compute up to 9 layers. Let me recount the layers properly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: The first (1 + 3) is the innermost, then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times E9, so 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems different from my previous calculation. Let me check where I went wrong. In my first attempt, I went up to Layer 14, but perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let's try this again, more carefully. Let me list each Ei step by step: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, but when I did the first calculation, I went up to 3*3280 = 9840, but that was only 7 layers. But in the problem, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering all layers. Let me confirm the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 1+ starts a new layer. Let's count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, E1 to E9, as I defined earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*E9 = 88572. But wait, in my first approach, I stopped at Layer 7, getting 3*3280 = 9840, but that was incorrect because I didn't go all the way to 9 layers. So, let's stick with the second approach, which seems more accurate. So, to recap: E1 = 4 E2 = 13 E3 = 40 E4 = 121 E5 = 364 E6 = 1093 E7 = 3280 E8 = 9841 E9 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that multiplication carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors in the Ei steps. Let me recompute E1 to E9: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f All these steps check out. Now, multiplying E9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost result by 3 at each stage. After computing each layer, the final value is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to count the number of 3s multiplied by each step. Wait, no, it's more about the number of nested expressions. Let me try to parse it. Starting from the innermost part: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each step is 3 multiplied by the result of the next inner expression plus 1. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside and moving out. Let me try to write this down step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost layer, and L9 is the outermost layer. So, L1: 1 + 3 = 4 L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 L3: 1 + 3*(L2) L4: 1 + 3*(L3) and so on until L9. Wait, but in the given expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then L2 would be 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then L3 would be 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, but wait, let me check: If L1 is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then L2 is 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then L3 is 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then L4 is 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, that seems to be a pattern, but maybe I should check each step carefully to avoid mistakes. Alternatively, maybe I can think of each layer as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term. Let me see. Let me try to compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. L3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. L4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. L5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. L6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. L7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. L8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. L9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing L9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L9.\n\nWait, let's go back to the layers:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, yes, L9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because that seems like a big number. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be thorough. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to compute it is 29524 * 3. Let's compute it as:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nMultiply each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm using another method. Let's break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nNow, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers, let me compute each layer again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

    "text": " Maybe it's a nine-layered expression. Let me try to number them from the inside out. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. The innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer becomes 40. Continuing this way, I think each layer can be computed by taking the result from the inner layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then proceeding outward. So, maybe I can create a table or list of these results as I go along. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer from the inside as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, actually, since we're starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and moving outward to Layer 9.

Wait, hold on, maybe I should write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit from right to left:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nAs above, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Maybe each layer is another multiplication by 3. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). That's the innermost expression. So, let me compute that first. Let's call that layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can write this down systematically. Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer n is the nth expression starting from the innermost one. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 multiplied by (Layer 9). So the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do the multiplication step by step: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that seems really big. Let me check my calculations again because that might be correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, earlier I had 121, but in the initial calculation, I thought Layer 4 was 121. Then Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in computing 3^10. Let me compute 3^10 step by step: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59,049. Therefore, a_9 is (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Then, 29,524 *3: Let's compute 29,524 *3 again: 29,524 *3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 88,572. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach give me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check: Starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So maybe it's a recursive structure where each term depends on the next one. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's easy: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level out is 13. Now, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*(previous result), which is 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, the next level is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if this pattern continues. Let's do the next level: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Next level: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Next: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Next level: 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Next level: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Next level: 1 + 3*29524. Calculating 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Finally, the outermost expression is 3 times this result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, putting it all together, the final result is 265,719. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost: (1+3)=4, then each step: 1 + 3*previous. So, 1 + 3*4=13, 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524, 1 + 3*29524=88573. Then, 3*88573=265,719. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result).

    "text": " Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). Inside that, there's another 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), and this continues. Let me try to parse this correctly. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost part and work my way out. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 multiplied by that result, plus 1. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(result of the inner layer). So, perhaps I can compute this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, right? Because the outermost term is 3*(L9). So, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). So, the first layer is 3*(1+3), then the next is 3*(1+3*(...)), so each layer adds one more. Wait, but in the original problem, how many times does this happen?\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3)\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 1+3*(...), so the number of layers is 9? Wait, let me see:\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1+3*(...)), so the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...):\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: 1+3((1+3))\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3((1+3)))\n4. And so on, until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, so if I have 9 layers, then L1 to L9, each computed as above. So, yes, L9 is 29524, then 3*L9=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me write down each step again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nL3:1 +3*L2=1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4:1 +3*L3=1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5:1 +3*L4=1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6:1 +3*L5=1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7:1 +3*L6=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8:1 +3*L7=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9:1 +3*L8=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time computing the next layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check L9 again. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I did this correctly. Each step builds on the previous one, and I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " Maybe each layer is a repetition of the same operation. Let me try to parse this step by step, starting from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, let me replace that part first. So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So now, that layer simplifies to 13. Then, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(13). Let's compute that: 3 times 13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. So that layer becomes 40. Continuing this process, the next layer would be 1 + 3(40). Calculating that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So now, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3(121). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So that's 364. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3(364). Let me compute that: 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3(1093). Calculating this: 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. That gives me 3280. Then, moving out another layer: 1 + 3(3280). Let me compute that: 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So that's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3(9841). Calculating this: 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So that's 29524. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3(29524). Let me compute that: 3 times 29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. That's 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3(88573). Let me calculate this: 3 times 88573 is 265719, plus 1 is 265720. So that simplifies the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses to 265720. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3 times 265720. Let me compute that: 3 times 200,000 is 600,000. 3 times 65,720 is 197,160. Adding those together: 600,000 + 197,160 equals 797,160. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because 3 times 265,720 is actually 797,160. But let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 265,720 times 3 digit by digit: 265,720 * 3: 0*3=0, 2*3=6, 7*3=21 (carryover 2), 5*3=15 +2=17 (carryover 1), 6*3=18 +1=19 (carryover 1), 2*3=6 +1=7. So writing it down: 797,160. Yes, that's correct. So, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 797,160. Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the number of layers or the multiplication. Let me recount the number of layers I simplified. Starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1: 4. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Layer 10: 1 + 3*29524=88573. Layer 11: 1 + 3*88573=265720. So, that's 11 layers in total, each time moving outward. Then, the outermost 3*(result) is 3*265720=797,160. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a specific sequence, perhaps a geometric progression or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_11. Then, the final result is 3*a_11. So, let's see if there's a formula for a_n in this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=11, a_11 = (3^{12} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^12: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147, 3^12=531441. So, a_11 = (531441 - 1)/2 = 531440/2 = 265720. That matches what I calculated earlier. So, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 265720, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*265720=797160. Therefore, the final answer is 797160. Wait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or the multiplications. Let me verify 3^12 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147, 3^12=531441. Yes, that's correct. So, (531441 - 1)/2 = 531440/2 = 265720. Then, 3*265720: 265720*3. Let me compute that step by step: 200,000*3=600,000; 60,000*3=180,000; 5,000*3=15,000; 700*3=2,100; 20*3=60. Adding them up: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 +15,000=795,000; 795,000 +2,100=797,100; 797,100 +60=797,160. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_11, and a_11 is (3^{12} - 1)/2, then 3*a_11 = 3*(3^{12} - 1)/2 = (3^{13} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{13}: 3^12 is 531,441, so 3^13 is 531,441*3=1,594,323. Then, (1,594,323 - 3)/2 = (1,594,320)/2 = 797,160. Yep, that's the same result. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 797,160.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By solving each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed with a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward, eventually computing the entire expression to find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(next term). Each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Solve the Recurrence Relation**:\n   - The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n   - Solving this, we find a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n3. **Compute the Innermost Layer**:\n   - Starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n4. **Iterate Through Each Layer**:\n   - Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous result).\n   - This continues until the outermost layer is reached.\n\n5. **Final Computation**:\n   - The innermost expression evaluates to 4.\n   - Each subsequent layer builds on the previous, leading to the outermost layer evaluating to 265,720.\n   - Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{797160}$"

    "text": " Let me see. Maybe if I start from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and work my way outwards, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that approach. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write that down step by step. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, since the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each adding another layer, maybe I should count how many layers there are. Let me check again:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, meaning there are 9 layers. So, each layer from 1 to 9. Let me confirm that. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). This goes on until Layer 9. After that, the entire expression is multiplied by 3, which is the outermost operation.\n\nSo, to compute this, I can compute each layer from 1 to 9, starting with Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nLet me create a table to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, the final result is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524. Let's see, 29524*3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nSo, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524*3. Let me do it step by step.\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Maybe I should double-check each layer computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me try to see if I can represent this expression as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, subtract 3B from both sides:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nBut perhaps it's more straightforward to think of each layer as a term in a series.\n\nWait, from the recurrence relation, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, S = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, S = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result again. So, this method also confirms the answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or using the closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same final result of 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation.\n\n3. Check for a pattern or formula to compute the layers more efficiently, confirming the result.\n\n4. Use the recurrence relation and closed-form solution to compute the final layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nAll methods led to the same result, so I'm pretty sure 88572 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me try to parse this from the inside out. Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let me denote each innermost expression as follows: Let\u2019s define E_n as the expression starting from the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, we have E_9 = 1 + 3. Then E_8 = 1 + 3(E_9), and so on, up to E_1 = 1 + 3(E_2), and the entire expression is 3(E_1). So, the entire problem is 3(E_1), where E_1 = 1 + 3(E_2), E_2 = 1 + 3(E_3), and so on until E_9 = 1 + 3. So, if I can compute E_9 first, then E_8, all the way up to E_1, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me try to compute these step by step. Let's start with E_9: E_9 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, moving up one layer to E_8: E_8 = 1 + 3(E_9) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so E_8 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so E_8 is 13. Next, E_7: E_7 = 1 + 3(E_8) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so E_7 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, E_7 is 40. Now, E_6: E_6 = 1 + 3(E_7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so E_6 = 1 + 120 = 121. That's E_6 = 121. Moving on to E_5: E_5 = 1 + 3(E_6) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. So, E_5 = 1 + 363 = 364. E_5 is 364. Next, E_4: E_4 = 1 + 3(E_5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so adding those up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, E_4 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E_4 is 1093. Now, E_3: E_3 = 1 + 3(E_4) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, E_3 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E_3 is 3280. Moving up to E_2: E_2 = 1 + 3(E_3) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Therefore, E_2 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E_2 is 9841. Now, finally, E_1: E_1 = 1 + 3(E_2) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, E_1 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. E_1 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(E_1) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors along the way. Starting from E_9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E_8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. E_7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. E_6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. E_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. E_4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. E_3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. E_2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. E_1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me verify this multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous breakdown. Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the previous breakdown. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, no carryover.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, no carryover.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12: write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7: write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15: write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28: write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8: write 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. So, my initial breakdown was correct, but when I did it digit by digit, I think I confused myself a bit, but the result is the same. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any errors in computing each E_n. Let me go through each step again quickly:\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward. Each layer is computed step by step, resulting in the final value.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's denote each layer as follows: Let me start from the innermost part. Let's define: Let me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is the last one, so maybe I should start from layer 1 as the innermost. Wait, let me check again. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? So that's the first layer, then each layer wraps around that. So maybe layer 1 is 1 + 3, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on, up to layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Let me confirm that. So, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(layer 1), which would be layer 2, and so on until layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 and moving outward. Let me try that. Let me write down each layer and compute it step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's easy enough. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Let me break it down: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400. 29,400 + 120 is 29,520, plus 3 is 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20,000*3 is 60,000, 9,000*3 is 27,000, 500*3 is 1,500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500. 88,500 + 60 is 88,560. 88,560 + 12 is 88,572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Let me just check the multiplication for Layer 9 again: 9,841 * 3. 9,000*3 is 27,000; 800*3 is 2,400; 40*3 is 120; 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524: 20,000*3 is 60,000; 9,000*3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 20*3 is 60; 4*3 is 12. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88,572. I think that's the correct solution. It was a bit tedious with all the layers, but by breaking it down each time, it became manageable. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous expression. So, perhaps each layer can be represented as 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me try to represent this as a series of nested expressions. Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s denote each level as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost layer.

Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121. 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let me compute that again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, then 1 + 3(...). Each time, there's a new set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 + 3)\nThen each layer adds another 1 + 3 before the previous one. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. So, there are 9 layers. So, L1 to L9, which I computed correctly. So, L9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer L_n, it's equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, matches L1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches L2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches L3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct, L4=121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct, L5=364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct, L6=1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct, L7=3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct, L8=9841.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct, L9=29524.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That's another way to compute it, and it also gives 88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the formula approach also confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer (L9) equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so maybe it's eight levels deep? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me see. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by something. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and so on. Maybe it's a recursive expression where each step depends on the next. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let's define each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9 or something. Let's see: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, it's 3 times that result. So Level 2: 3 * Level 1 = 3 * 4 = 12. Then, we add 1 to that result: Level 2 result is 1 + 12 = 13. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each level is 3*(1 + next level). So perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous step). Let me try that approach. Let me define each level as follows:\n\n- Level 1: 1 + 3\n- Level 2: 3*(1 + Level 1)\n- Level 3: 3*(1 + Level 2)\n- ...\n- Up to Level 9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is Level 1. Then the next level is 3*(1 + Level 1), which would be Level 2, and so on. Let me try to compute each level step by step.\n\nStarting with Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Level 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) eight times, so maybe there are only eight levels after the initial 3. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, there are nine (1 + 3) terms, but each is multiplied by 3 and added inside the next parentheses. So maybe the number of levels is nine? Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps the way I numbered the levels is off. Let me try to count the number of 3s being multiplied. Let me write the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next level: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n10. Finally, the outermost 3: 3*36084 = 108252\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost, we have to go through each level, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and then finally multiply the entire thing by 3 again. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(...), so after Level 9, we have to multiply that result by 3 as well. So the final result would be 3*36084 = 108252. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Level 9 as 36084, and then multiplied by 3 to get 108252. But let me check if I miscounted the levels. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied in the original expression. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of 3s would be one more than the number of innermost (1+3). Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each level adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time after the first 3, there's another 3*(...). So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nSo, each level adds another 3*(...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent level adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new level. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new level. Let me count how many 3s are inside:\n\n1. 3*(...)\n2. 3*(...)\n3. 3*(...)\n4. 3*(...)\n5. 3*(...)\n6. 3*(...)\n7. 3*(...)\n8. 3*(...)\n9. 3*(...)\n\nWait, so there are nine 3s, but the innermost is (1 + 3), so maybe the number of levels is eight? Wait, no, because each 3*(...) is a new level, so starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Level 1, then each 3*(1 + Level n) is the next level. So, if I have eight 3s after the first one, that would make nine levels. Wait, perhaps I should count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). Then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many times does 3 get multiplied? Let's see:\n\n1. The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3)\n\nSo, the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier is eight times, right? Because the innermost is (1 + 3), and each time you go out a level, you add another 3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are eight 3s as multipliers. So, that would mean there are eight levels to compute. Let me try that again, computing eight levels:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 8) = 3*12027 = 36081.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final result was 108252, but that was when I considered nine levels. Now, if there are eight levels, the final result would be 36081. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of levels is equal to the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Let me look at the original expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent term is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's nine 3s in total, including the first one. So, perhaps the number of levels is nine. Let me try computing nine levels then.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*(12028) = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost 3 is already included in Level 9. Wait, no, because Level 9 is 3*(1 + Level 8), so the outermost 3 is part of Level 9, which would make the final result 36084, and there's no need to multiply by another 3. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Level 1: 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 3*(1 + Level n). So, Level 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I included the outermost 3 as Level 9, but actually, Level 9 is 3*(1 + Level 8), which is 36084. So, the outermost expression is 3*(...), which would be 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, no, because Level 9 is 3*(1 + Level 8), which is 36084, and that's the result inside the outermost 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me write the expression with placeholders:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me replace each innermost expression step by step:\n\nStart from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one level: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nNext level: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 108252.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I thought there were eight levels after the innermost, but now I'm seeing nine levels, with the outermost being the ninth. So, perhaps the correct answer is 108252.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a smaller version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext level: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nNext level: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nOutermost: 3*(48) = 144\n\nWait, but let's compute it directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nThen: 3*48 = 144\n\nYes, that's correct. So, in this case, there are three levels of 3*(...), and the final result is 144.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, there are nine levels of 3*(...), so the final result would be 108252.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought of it as eight levels, but with the smaller example, it's three levels leading to 144, which is 3^4 * 2, but perhaps that's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think.\n\nEach level can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at level n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let me compute a_1 through a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 15\n\na_3 = 48\n\na_4 = 147\n\na_5 = 444\n\na_6 = 1335\n\na_7 = 4008\n\na_8 = 12027\n\na_9 = 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, let's check:\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWith a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3\n\n-2K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\nSo, 4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n8 = 6C - 3\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\n11 = 6C\n\nC = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nSo, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, factor out 1/2:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to work.\n\nSo, for a_9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. Correct, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nSo, the final answer is 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Since a_n is defined as the value after n levels, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 108252.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for the entire expression.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nWith nine levels of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nBut since we've already computed it step by step, and using the recurrence relation, I think 108252 is correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute it again step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nOutermost: 3*36084 = 108252\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nE = 3*a_9 = 3*(11*3^8 - 3)/2 = 3*(72171 - 3)/2 = 3*(72168)/2 = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've got it right. The final answer is 108252.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each level involves computing 3 times (1 plus the result of the next level). After computing each level, we substitute the result back into the next level until we reach the outermost expression.\n\nHere's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost level (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost expression:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 36084 = 108252\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{108252}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to count how many times 3 is multiplied. Starting from the innermost, which is 3(1 + 3), then each time, it's wrapped in another 3(1 + ...). So maybe there are eight layers here? Let me check: starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(previous), and so on, until the outermost layer. So perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me see: starting from the innermost, the first operation is 1 + 3, then that's multiplied by 3 and added 1, and so on. So maybe it's a recursive expression. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geometric series or something that can be simplified with a formula. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. So, let me define each layer as a step, starting from the innermost. Let's number them from 1 to 9, with 1 being the innermost. So step 1: Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, step 2: The next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Step 3: Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Step 4: 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Step 5: 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Step 6: 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Step 7: 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Step 8: 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Step 9: 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, after computing all nine layers, the innermost expression has been evaluated to 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3*(this entire expression). So I need to multiply 29524 by 3. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, but that's not the right way because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is actually 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1, which is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So when I compute 29524 *3, I can compute each digit times 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 *3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me verify that because sometimes when I do it quickly, I might make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier steps because that would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go back through each step to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nStep3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nStep4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nStep5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nStep6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nStep8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen multiply by 3:29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...). So after computing all the inner layers, which resulted in 29524, I have to multiply that by 3, which gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each step, but since I've already computed it step by step, and each step checks out, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which seems like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that confirms my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the exponentiation. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2=243^2. Let me compute 243*243:\n\nCompute 200*243=48,600\n\n40*243=9,720\n\n3*243=729\n\nAdd them together: 48,600 +9,720=58,320 +729=59,049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo 3^10=59,049, so a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous result). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Expression (Layer 1):**  \n   Compute \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\).\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\).\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\).\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\).\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe each layer is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. So, perhaps each layer is a term like 1 + 3*(next layer). That would mean I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try to write each layer as a separate step. Let's define each layer as follows: Let me number the innermost parentheses as Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9, with the outermost multiplication by 3 being Layer 9's result. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, that's just 4) Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.

Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k). Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}, and a particular solution can be found. Let me find the particular solution. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying initial condition: at n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

    "text": " Maybe it's a chain of nine operations. Let me try to parse this. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me define a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1. Then, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. Hmm, that seems like a plan. So, let me compute each a_i step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3 times 29524: 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572, so adding those together, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\na1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\na2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that seems like a different breakdown. Alternatively, 29524 can be broken down as 29000 + 524.\n\n29000*3 = 87000.\n\n524*3: 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 1500 + 60 = 1560 + 12 = 1572.\n\nThen, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression had nine sets of parentheses, each adding 1 + 3*(...). So, a1 to a9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, that's correct. So, 3*a9 is the outermost multiplication, which gives 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each step seems to follow logically, and I double-checked the arithmetic. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous result, and this process is repeated nine times. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous step:\n   - a\u2082 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - a\u2083 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - a\u2084 = 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - a\u2085 = 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - a\u2086 = 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - a\u2087 = 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - a\u2088 = 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - a\u2089 = 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the final result by 3:\n   - 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outwards. Let's start with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that 4. So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So the next layer out is 13. Moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3 times 13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So that's 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So that's 121. Continuing outward, we have 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, and adding 1 gives us 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let's see, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12, so adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. Moving outward again, we have 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then 1 + 88572 is 88573. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's calculate 3*88573. Breaking it down: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then 1 + 265719 is 265720. So, the entire expression simplifies to 265720. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to slip up with such large numbers. Let me go through each step again quickly:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time. So I think the final answer is 265720. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count how many times I performed the operations:\n\nStarting from the innermost, I did the computation 9 times, each time moving outward. So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573, 265720. Wait, actually, that's 10 computations. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous result) +1. Let's see, each layer is one more multiplication and addition. So, the number of layers is 9, because each opening parenthesis is one layer. So, perhaps I have 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers, so after layer 9, we have 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(that result). Wait, no, let me check the original expression again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, after computing the innermost layers up to layer 9, which gives 29524, then the outermost operation is 3*(29524). Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because in my initial computation, I went one layer beyond, which might have been incorrect.\n\nLet me clarify. The expression is 3*(layer 9). So, if layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. So, 3*29524 is 88572, and then is there an addition of 1? Wait no, because the expression is 3*(1 + ...). Wait, no, let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went one step further, adding 1 to 88572, which was incorrect. So, actually, the final result is 88572, not 265720. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- The innermost expression is 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1).\n\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000*3 = 60000\n\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n\n- 500*3 = 1500\n\n- 20*3 = 60\n\n- 4*3 = 12\n\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went one step further, thinking that there was another layer, but I think that's where I messed up. The original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), and after computing the ninth layer, we multiply by 3, not add 1. So, the correct final answer should be 88572, not 265720.\n\nLet me verify this again:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think my initial mistake was adding one more layer than necessary, which led to an incorrect final answer. After correcting that, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of the operation 1 + 3*(something). This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, in this case, a_1 would be the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on, up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8. Then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, for such a recursive sequence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtracting 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1.\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it directly without manually stepping through each layer, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of error.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we can compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Move to the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. After computing the ninth layer, multiply the result by 3:  \n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's say:\n\nLet a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is multiplied by 3. So maybe each a_i is the value inside the parentheses at each step, and then the entire expression is 3 times a_9.\n\nWait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So each a_i is the value inside each set of parentheses. So a\u2081 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a\u2082 is the next layer, which is 1 + 3*a\u2081, and so on until a\u2089. Then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089. So the total value would be 3*a\u2089. So if I compute up to a\u2089, then multiply by 3, that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So yes, a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, so 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo it's 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n.\n\nWait, because each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nSo let's solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a\u2081=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=1: a\u2081 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more terms using the formula to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=4: a\u2084 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll right, so the formula works. Therefore, the computation is correct.\n\nSo the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. We define a sequence \\(a_n\\) where each term is built by the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with the initial condition \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\n1. Compute each term step by step:\n   - \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - \\(a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13\\)\n   - \\(a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40\\)\n   - \\(a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121\\)\n   - \\(a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364\\)\n   - \\(a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\(3 \\cdot a_9\\):\n   - \\(3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n3. Verification using the recurrence relation solution:\n   - The general solution for the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n   - For \\(n = 9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, maybe it's eight layers because the innermost one is just (1 + 3). Let me check: Starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So perhaps it's eight layers. Let me try to parse it correctly. Let me number them from the inside out. Let's start by defining each layer step by step. Let me assign variables to each layer to make it easier. Let me define:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8)\n\nSo, if I compute each layer one by one, starting from Layer 1, I can build up to the final answer.

Let me check the multiplication again because 9841 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n3 * 1 = 3\n\n3 * 4 = 12, carry over 1.\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2.\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 2 = 29.\n\nSo, writing it down: 29,523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nThen 3*9841=29,523.

Maybe a geometric series or something. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find a_8 directly.\n\nSince the expression is 3*(a_8), which is 3*(9841)=29,523.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_8 = (3^{9} -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Then 3*9841=29,523.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 29,523.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times 9841\\). Calculating this gives:\n\\[ 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{29523}\\)."

So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me write each step down as I compute it. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses first. Let's define each level as follows: Level 1: (1 + 3) Level 2: 3(Level 1) Level 3: 1 + Level 2 Level 4: 3(Level 3) Level 5: 1 + Level 4 Level 6: 3(Level 5) Level 7: 1 + Level 6 Level 8: 3(Level 7) Level 9: 1 + Level 8 Level 10: 3(Level 9) Hmm, maybe that's overcomplicating it. Let me try again. Wait, actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So each time, it's 3 times something that starts with 1 plus another 3 times something. Let me see if I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me label each innermost expression as step 1, then build up each layer step by step. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. Step 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, step 2: 3 * (result from step 1) = 3 * 4 = 12. Then, moving out another layer, we have (1 + result from step 2). So, step 3: 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer out is 3 times that, so step 4: 3 * 13 = 39. Then, moving out another layer, we have (1 + result from step 4). So, step 5: 1 + 39 = 40. Next, 3 times that, step 6: 3 * 40 = 120. Then, step 7: 1 + 120 = 121. Step 8: 3 * 121 = 363. Step 9: 1 + 363 = 364. Step 10: 3 * 364 = 1092. Wait, but let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so maybe I'm counting one too many steps. Let me recount. Let me see, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the first step, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, perhaps there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), each time multiplied by 3. Let me try to model this as a recursive process, where each layer is 1 + 3 * previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is just (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3 * previous layer. So, let's define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3 * a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I had before. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me check again. So, starting with a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the outermost layer is 3 times a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify step by step because I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the layers in the original problem. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many (1 + 3(...)) are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, it's 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)): 1. (1 + 3) 2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) 3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) ... and so on. Wait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is (1 + 3*(previous)), so each time we add a layer, we're adding another (1 + 3*...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each (1 + 3(...)) adds a new opening parenthesis. Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The first innermost is (1 + 3)\n3. Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) = 12\n\nLevel 3: 1 + Level 2 = 13\n\nLevel 4: 3*(Level 3) = 39\n\nLevel 5: 1 + Level 4 = 40\n\nLevel 6: 3*(Level 5) = 120\n\nLevel 7: 1 + Level 6 = 121\n\nLevel 8: 3*(Level 7) = 363\n\nLevel 9: 1 + Level 8 = 364\n\nLevel 10: 3*(Level 9) = 1092\n\nWait, but that seems to be 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), each time multiplied by 3. So, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3(...). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps each (1 + 3(...)) represents a layer, so the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then, moving out, each time we add another (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, if there are 9 layers, that would mean we have 9 such (1 + 3(...)) expressions. So, let's compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9, then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, let's define a_1 = (1 + 3) = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted the layers correctly. Let me check the original expression again to ensure that I have 9 layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times I see (1 + 3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\n2. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is the above\n\n3. Another (1 + 3(...))\n\nContinuing until we reach the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer.\n\n2. Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, from the innermost, each time we add a layer, we're adding another (1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nSo, in total, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\n3. 1 + 3*(12) = 13\n\n4. 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. 1 + 3*(39) = 40\n\n6. 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. 1 + 3*(120) = 121\n\n8. 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. 1 + 3*(363) = 364\n\n10. 3*(364) = 1092\n\nWait, but that seems like 10 layers, but the original expression only has 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)), which is 9 times. So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct because each time we're adding a layer, and there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), each time multiplied by 3, except the outermost which is just multiplied by 3 once.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(4) = 12\n\nOutermost: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(13) = 39.\n\nAlternatively, using my layer method:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(13) = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, in this case, with two layers of (1 + 3(...)), we have Layer 1 and Layer 2, then multiplied by 3.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), so Layers 1 through 9, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, we had two layers, but we only had to compute two layers, then multiply by 3. So, in the original problem, 9 layers, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each time we go out, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer), and finally, the entire expression is 3*(last layer).\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), then we have Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from (1 + 3) as Layer 1.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) has two layers: Layer 1 is (1 + 3) = 4, Layer 2 is (1 + 3*4) = 13, then multiplied by 3 to get 39. So, in that case, 2 layers, then multiply by 3.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, 9 layers, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with another small example to be sure.\n\nTake 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, three layers.\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*4 = 12\n\nNext layer: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(4) = 12\n\nNext layer: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 3*(13) = 39\n\nWait, but that's three layers: (1 + 3), then 3*(...), then 1 + ..., then 3*(...). So, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n from 1 to 9, we compute each a_n, then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a pattern in the a_n terms.\n\nLooking at the a_n terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nI notice that each a_n is equal to 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the general solution approach because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake there.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is indeed a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we assume a constant particular solution, a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition at n=1:\n\na_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to compute each layer efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Compute the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Layer 1:**\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\n3. **Layer 2:**\n   - Add 1: \\(1 + 12 = 13\\).\n\n4. **Layer 3:**\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 13 = 39\\).\n\n5. **Layer 4:**\n   - Add 1: \\(1 + 39 = 40\\).\n\n6. **Layer 5:**\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\).\n\n7. **Layer 6:**\n   - Add 1: \\(1 + 120 = 121\\).\n\n8. **Layer 7:**\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 121 = 363\\).\n\n9. **Layer 8:**\n   - Add 1: \\(1 + 363 = 364\\).\n\n10. **Layer 9:**\n    - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 364 = 1092\\).\n\n11. **Final Layer:**\n    - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 1092 = 3276\\).\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating the structure, we realize that each layer beyond the innermost is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\), leading to a total of 9 layers. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the value at the 9th layer is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe each layer adds another 3 multiplied by a term. Let me try to parse it from the inside out. Let's start by identifying the innermost expression. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, let's compute that first. So, (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that's 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*40. That would be 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, moving on. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Hmm, 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364 is... let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Wow, that's a big number. Okay, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 3*1093: let me check that again. 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Hmm, okay, so that layer is 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Okay, so that's 9841. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. Wait, no, wait. 3*9841: Let me compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Okay, so that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together, it's 88572. Wait, that seems off. Let me check again. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right, 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that's the result of the innermost expression. Now, going back to the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, the entire expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 88573 * 3: 3*3=9, 3*7=21, 3*5=15, 3*8=24, 3*8=24. Wait, no, let me do it digit by digit. 88573 * 3: Starting from the right, 3*3=9. Next digit: 7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. Next: 8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2. Next: 8*3=24 +2=26, write down 6, carry over 2. Next: 3*0=0 +2=2. Wait, but the number is 88573, so the digits are 8,8,5,7,3. So, starting from the right: 3*3=9, 3*7=21, 3*5=15, 3*8=24, 3*8=24. So, let's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 3*3=9\n- Tens place: 3*7=21, write 1, carry 2\n- Hundreds place: 3*5=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1\n- Thousands place: 3*8=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2\n- Ten-thousands place: 3*8=24 +2=26, write 6, carry 2\n- Since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, the result is 265719. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 88573*3: Let's compute it step by step.\n\n88573 * 3:\n\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 7 = 21, so 1 with a carryover of 2\n- 3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, so 7 with a carryover of 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24 +1 =25, so 5 with a carryover of 2\n- 3 * 8 =24 +2=26, so 6 with a carryover of 2\n- Since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 is added as the next digit.\n\nSo, the result is 265719. Let me verify that by adding 88573 three times:\n\n88573 + 88573 = 177146\n\n177146 + 88573 = Let's compute 177146 + 88573.\n\nAdding units: 6 +3=9\n\nTens:4 +7=11, write 1, carry 1\n\nHundreds:1 +5=6 +1=7\n\nThousands:7 +8=15, write 5, carry 1\n\nTen-thousands:7 +8=15 +1=16, write 6, carry 1\n\nHundred-thousands:1 +0=1 +1=2\n\nSo, the sum is 265719. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*88573=265719.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost (1+3)=4, then each layer outwards:\n\n1.

Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) =4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*(Layer1)=1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)=1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(Layer4)=1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(Layer5)=1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(Layer6)=1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(Layer7)=1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(Layer8)=1+3*9841=29524\n\nLayer10:1 +3*(Layer9)=1+3*29524=88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer10)=3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, but I think I miscounted the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, but when I started counting, I went up to Layer10. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer. Let me count how many times (1+3) appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me write it as:\n\nLayer1: (1+3) =4\n\nLayer2: (1+3*(Layer1))=1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3: (1+3*(Layer2))=1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4: (1+3*(Layer3))=1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5: (1+3*(Layer4))=1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6: (1+3*(Layer5))=1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7: (1+3*(Layer6))=1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8: (1+3*(Layer7))=1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9: (1+3*(Layer8))=1+3*9841=29524\n\nLayer10: (1+3*(Layer9))=1+3*29524=88573\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers, right? Because after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, when I computed up to Layer10, that might be incorrect. Let me recount.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) =4\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3) =1+3*4=13\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))=1+3*13=40\n\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))=1+3*40=121\n\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))=1+3*121=364\n\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))=1+3*364=1093\n\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))=1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))=1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))=1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, where did I go wrong? Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, each corresponding to each opening parenthesis after the initial 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*(Layer2)=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*(Layer3)=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*(Layer4)=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*(Layer5)=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*(Layer6)=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*(Layer7)=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*(Layer8)=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the outermost layer was 1 +3*(Layer9)=88573, but that would be Layer10, which doesn't exist because the original expression only has 9 layers. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial counting. The expression has 9 layers, so after 9 layers, the value is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) =4\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3)=1+12=13\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))=1+3*13=40\n\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))=1+3*40=121\n\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))=1+3*121=364\n\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))=1+3*364=1093\n\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))=1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))=1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))=1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the outermost layer was 1 +3*(29524)=88573, but that would be if there was a 10th layer, which doesn't exist. So, I think I made a mistake in my initial counting by adding an extra layer. So, the correct result should be 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. It's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, that's 9 layers. So, my initial counting was correct up to Layer9:29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that after Layer9, I had 29524, and then the entire expression was 3*29524=88572. So, that's the correct result.\n\nBut wait, in my initial calculation, I went up to Layer10, which gave me 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. But that must be wrong because the original expression only has 9 layers. So, the correct result should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again to make sure. The problem is:\n\nCompute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the innermost expression is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3(1+3(...)), where the ... has 8 more (1+3(...)) terms. Wait, no, let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next term is (1+3(...)), and inside that, there's another (1+3(...)), and so on, until the innermost (1+3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nAfter the initial 3, the first ( is the start of the first layer. Then, inside that, another ( starts the second layer, and so on, until the innermost (1+3). So, let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n10. ...1+3)))\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of (1+3(...)) expressions is 9. Each of these is a layer. So, the innermost is the 9th layer: (1+3). Then, each layer wraps around it. So, layer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*(layer1)=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*(layer2)=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*(layer3)=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*(layer4)=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*(layer5)=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*(layer6)=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*(layer7)=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*(layer8)=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that after layer9, the value was 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the last layer was 1 +3*29524=88573, but that would be an extra layer, which doesn't exist because the original expression only has 9 layers. So, I think I made a mistake in my initial counting by adding an extra layer.\n\nSo, to summarize, the correct evaluation is:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n\n2. 1+3*4=13\n\n3. 1+3*13=40\n\n4. 1+3*40=121\n\n5. 1+3*121=364\n\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this because earlier I thought I had 265,719, but that was because I miscounted the layers. So, I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again: 29524 *3.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\n- 3*0=0, but since there's no more digits, we can ignore it.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo, 29524 *3:\n\n- Units place:4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens place:2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n- Ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265,719, but that was due to an extra layer. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct result. I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the result step by step.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Next layer out**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Next layer out**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Next layer out**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Next layer out**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Next layer out**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Next layer out**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Next layer out**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Next layer out**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Outermost layer**:  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to count how many 3s there are. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by another expression. Maybe I can compute this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. Let me try to represent this step by step. Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost. So, Level 1: 1 + 3. Then Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1). Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2), and so on, up to Level 9. So, starting with Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. Then Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, so Level 2 is 13. Now Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: that's 39. Adding 1 gives 40. So Level 3 is 40. Moving on to Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 4 is 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121: 121*3 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. I can break this down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from Level 1: 1+3=4, correct. Level 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Level 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Level 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Level 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Level 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Level 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Level 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Level 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3: 4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\nSo, 29524 \u00d73 is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each level step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrive at the final result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost term, each level is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each level until the outermost expression is reached, resulting in the final value.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   - Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Use this result for the next level:\n   - Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent level:\n   - Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n4. Finally, multiply the outermost expression by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's a jump. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121. 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, moving on. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's a big number. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Wow, this is growing rapidly. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Okay, moving on to Level 9, which is the outermost one before the initial 3 multiplier. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses is 29524. Now, the original problem is 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Level 1: 1+3=4. Level 2: 1+3*4=13. Level 3: 1+3*13=40. Level 4: 1+3*40=121. Level 5: 1+3*121=364. Level 6: 1+3*364=1093. Level 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Level 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Level 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. It's like a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. If I recall, the formula for such a recurrence relation is something like a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at each level n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, at level 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. So, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each level is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. By solving this recurrence, we find that each level n can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the given problem, which has 9 levels, we compute a_9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute each level from the inside out**:\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the final result by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E9 is the innermost one. So, starting from the inside: E9 = 1 + 3. Then, E8 = 1 + 3*E9. E7 = 1 + 3*E8. And so on, until E1, which is the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*E1. Hmm, that might be a systematic way to approach it. Let me try that. So, let me define E1 as the innermost expression and work my way out. Wait, no, actually, E9 is the innermost, so let me list them from E9 to E1.

It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from E9:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29,524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Is there a pattern or a formula that I can use here instead of computing each step manually? Because computing each E from E9 to E1 seems tedious, and if the problem had more layers, this method might not be efficient. Maybe there's a geometric series or some recursive formula that can be applied here.\n\nLooking back at the structure, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E9=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E9 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWait, but let me see. The homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant.\n\nSo, let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1\n\n-2*K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E9 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=9, E_9 = C*3^{9} - 1/2 = 4\n\nThus, C*3^9 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, C = (9/2) / 3^9 = (9/2) / 19,683 = (9)/(2*19,683) = 9/39,366 = 3/13,122 = 1/4,374.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but maybe it's correct.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (1/4,374)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nBut let me check this with n=9:\n\nE9 = (1/4,374)*3^9 - 1/2.\n\n3^9 is 19,683.\n\nSo, (19,683)/(4,374) = ?\n\nWell, 4,374 * 4 = 17,496\n\n4,374 * 4.5 = 17,496 + 2,187 = 19,683.\n\nSo, 19,683 / 4,374 = 4.5.\n\nSo, E9 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula works for n=9.\n\nNow, let's compute E1, which is when n=1.\n\nWait, but in our case, E9 is the innermost, so as we go outward, n increases. Wait, actually, in our earlier definitions, E9 is the innermost, and E1 is the outermost, so n=9 corresponds to E9, and n=1 corresponds to E1. So, perhaps I should adjust the indexing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of E1 as the innermost, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, let me adjust the formula so that when n=9, E9=4.\n\nSo, E_n = (1/4,374)*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nThen, for n=9, E9=4.\n\nFor n=1, E1 = (1/4,374)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (3)/(4,374) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify 3/4,374: 3 divides into 4,374 1,458 times. So, 3/4,374 = 1/1,458.\n\nSo, E1 = 1/1,458 - 1/2.\n\nTo subtract these, find a common denominator, which is 2,916.\n\n1/1,458 = 2/2,916\n\n1/2 = 1,458/2,916\n\nSo, E1 = 2/2,916 - 1,458/2,916 = (2 - 1,458)/2,916 = (-1,456)/2,916.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4: -364/729.\n\nHmm, that's a negative number, but E1 is supposed to be a positive number, as all the terms in the expression are positive. So, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the indexing is the problem. Maybe I should index E1 as the innermost expression, so E1 = 1 + 3, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, etc., up to E9 being the outermost. Let me try that.\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which matches what I got earlier. So, perhaps my initial mistake was in how I set up the recurrence relation, considering the indexing. So, the formula approach might not be necessary here, especially since the problem only has nine layers, making the manual computation feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for E_n in terms of n, but given that n is only 9, it's probably more efficient to compute each step manually, as I did before.\n\nWait, but let me try again with the recurrence relation, just to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume E_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, E1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nE1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nE2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nE3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nE4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nE5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nE6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2,187 -1)/2=2,186/2=1,093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nE7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6,561 -1)/2=6,560/2=3,280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nE8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19,683 -1)/2=19,682/2=9,841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nE9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost expression is 3*E9, so:\n\n3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2,187\n\n3^8=6,561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\n3^10=59,049\n\n3^11=177,147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177,147.\n\nThus, 3*E9 = (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each step manually.\n\nSo, that's a much more efficient way to compute it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, either method works. The recurrence approach is more scalable if there were more layers, though.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I found that the expression simplifies to 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression.

Next, Step 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check that pattern. So, if I define each step n as S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), starting from S(1) = 4, then S(2) = 13, S(3) = 40, and so on. That seems to be the case. Let me try to compute each step up to S(9) since the expression is nested nine times. Wait, no, actually, let me count the number of steps. Each time we have a 3(1 + ...), so how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )... )). So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one. The initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), and each 3 is part of another layer. Let me see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s after the first one. Each time we have a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the first 3, the next 3 is the second layer, and so on. Let me count: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are eight more 3s inside the parentheses. Wait, no, actually, each 3 is part of a new layer. Let me think differently: the entire expression is 3 times something, and that something is 1 plus 3 times another something, and so on. Each time, we're adding a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(first layer). Then the next is 1 + 3*(second layer), and so on, until we reach the outermost layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1. Then another 1, and so on. Wait, no, each time it's 3(1 + ...), so each 3 after the first is part of a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one. The first 3 is at the beginning, then inside, there's another 3, and so on. Let me see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, how many times does 3 appear after the first one? Let me see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and each ... contains another 3. So, the number of 3s after the first one is equal to the number of layers minus one. Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of closing parentheses. The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is one layer. Then each time we add another layer. Let me try to count the number of closing parentheses. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, that's one closing parenthesis. Then moving out, each layer adds another closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses in the entire expression. The expression ends with ... ))))))) So, that's seven closing parentheses after the initial part. Wait, let me check: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the closing parentheses at the end: there are seven of them: ))))))) So, that means there are seven layers after the first one. Wait, no, because each layer adds one closing parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer with one closing parenthesis. Then each time we add another layer, adding another closing parenthesis. So, if there are seven closing parentheses at the end, that would mean seven layers beyond the first one? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's start from the innermost expression and work our way out, computing each step as I go. That might help me avoid confusion. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let's compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Continuing: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572, so 1 + 88572 = 88573. Now, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that: 3*88,573. Let's break it down: 3*80,000 = 240,000; 3*8,000 = 24,000; 3*500 = 1,500; 3*70 = 210; 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So, 3*88,573 = 265,719. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 265,719. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Then 3*88573 = 265,719. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. Each time I compute a step, I'm moving one layer out. Starting from the innermost, which is step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Step 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3: 3*88573 = 265,719. Wait, so that's 10 steps? But the original expression seems to have nine layers after the initial 3. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sequences. Starting from the first one after the initial 3: 1. Then another 1. So, how many? Let's see: each time we have \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the next is \"1 + 3(\", then another \"1 + 3(\", and so on, until the end. Let me count: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are nine \"1 + 3(\" instances. Wait, no, because each \"1 + 3(\" is part of a new layer. Let me think of it as a tree. The initial 3 is at level 0. Then, inside it, we have \"1 + 3(...)\", which is level 1. Inside that 3, we have another \"1 + 3(...)\", level 2, and so on. So, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: 1. Then another 1, and so on, until the end. Let me count: 3( [1] + 3( [2] + 3( [3] + 3( [4] + 3( [5] + 3( [6] + 3( [7] + 3( [8] + 3( [9] + 3( [10] + 3))))))))) So, there are 10 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 10 layers. Therefore, when I computed up to step 10, that's correct. So, the total is 265,719. But let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nThen, 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step's result is used in the next step, and the multiplication by 3 is done correctly. So, the final answer should be 265,719. I think that's right. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Let me think: the expression is a repeated application of S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), starting from S(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for S(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is S(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that.\n\nGiven S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 4.\n\nAssume S(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1) becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B).\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition S(1) = 4:\n\nS(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is S(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: S(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 10 (since we have 10 layers), S(10) = (3^11 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, S(10) = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*S(10) = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 265,719. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, I'm confident that the solution is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is defined as \\( S(n) = 1 + 3 \\times S(n-1) \\) starting from \\( S(1) = 4 \\). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 265,719.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " Maybe each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3 times that, and so on. So, perhaps I can compute this by starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let me try that. Let's start by evaluating the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 = 12. Then, moving to the next layer, we have (1 + 3*(previous result)). Wait, no, let me make sure. Each layer is (1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost, let's denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, maybe. Let me try to map this out. Let me define each layer step by step. Let me number the layers from the inside out as L1 to L9. So, L1 is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, L2 is (1 + 3*L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, L3 is (1 + 3*L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 is (1 + 3*L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 is (1 + 3*L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 is (1 + 3*L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 is (1 + 3*L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 is (1 + 3*L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 is (1 + 3*L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times L9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 3*3=9. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy. L1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. L2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a nested expression where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let me denote the innermost expression as a recurrence relation. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the base case a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches L1 above. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is L2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is L3, and so on. So, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, to find a closed-form formula for a_n, we can solve this recurrence relation. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging this into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, which matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct, matches a_3. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me see. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9, since there are 9 layers. Wait, let me count: The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is 9. Let me confirm: Starting from the innermost, (1 + 3) is layer 1. Then moving out, each (1 + 3*(...)) adds a layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, using the formula, the total value is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that directly: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me double-check the key steps. First, the formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is indeed 59049. 59049 -1 is 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88,572. Correct. Alternatively, if I compute 3^{10} = 59049, then 3^{10} -1 = 59048. 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. All correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. So, using the formula, the total is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Let me compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 12\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 120\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: Let's see, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3 = 9000, 280*3 = 840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's calculate this step by step. 9000*3 = 27,000, 800*3 = 2,400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. So adding those up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nLayer 9 is 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\n3*(29,524) = ?\n\nCompute that: 30,000*3 = 90,000, but since it's 29,524, let's compute 29,524*3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000*3 = 60,000\n\n9,000*3 = 27,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me verify each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication also seems correct. So, I think 88,572 is the right answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recursion: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for layer 9, a_9 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that this is the correct result. It's a large number, but given the multiple layers of multiplication, it makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Let's see: starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). That something is another 3 multiplied by (1 + something else). This continues until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple enough: 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so now we're at 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, 121 now. Next: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, 364. Then, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let's see, 3*364 is... let me compute that: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Okay, so that layer is 1093. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that layer is 29524. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. So, adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that's 88573. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Now, adding those up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 equals 265,719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Finally, 3*88573 = 265,719. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think I did that correctly. Each step, I took the result from the innermost parentheses and worked my way outward, multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. It's a bit tedious, but since each layer depends only on the previous one, it's manageable. I guess the key here was recognizing the pattern and systematically working from the inside out without getting lost in the layers. I was worried I might skip a layer or miscalculate a multiplication, but by breaking it down step by step and keeping track of each result, I managed to get through it. So, I feel confident that 265,719 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute the result step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Outermost layer: 3*88573 = 265719\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{265719}."

Let's denote each layer as follows: Let me number the innermost parentheses as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, let me start from the innermost and work my way out.

Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*29,000 = 87,000. 3*524 = 1,572. So, adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572. Wait, no, 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. So adding those: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.

Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach set of (1 + 3) is a layer. Let's see: the innermost is (1+3), then the next is (1 + 3*(1+3)), then (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nUp to how many layers? Let's see, the original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, actually, each time you have a 1 + 3(...), so the number of layers is 9, but I think I might have miscounted earlier. Wait, let me count the number of times the pattern (1 + 3(...)) occurs. Each time you have a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)). Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost. But in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my calculation of 88,572 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r + 3 = 0, so r = -3. So the homogeneous solution is A*(-3)^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*(-3)^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*(-3)^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = -3A - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = -3A => 9/2 = -3A => A = -(9/2)/3 = -3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (-3/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2. Let's simplify that:\n\na_n = (-3/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2 = (3/2)*(3)^n - 1/2, since (-3)^n = (-1)^n * 3^n, and when multiplied by -3/2, it becomes (3/2)*(3)^n when n is even, but wait, actually, let me check:\n\nWait, (-3)^n = (-1)^n * 3^n, so (-3/2)*(-3)^n = (-3/2)*(-1)^n *3^n = (3/2)*(-1)^{n+1}*3^n. Hmm, perhaps it's better to write it as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. Wait, let me test this formula.\n\nWait, for n=1, a_1 should be 4. Let's plug n=1 into a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2: (3^2 - 3)/2 = (9 - 3)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe my assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} + 1)/2. Let's test that: For n=1, (3^2 +1)/2 = (9+1)/2=10/2=5. Not matching a_1=4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let's test n=1: (3 - 1)/2=1, which is not 4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the general solution. Let me try solving the recurrence again.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r + 3 = 0, so r = -3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*(-3)^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*(-3)^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*(-3)^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = -3C - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = -3C => 9/2 = -3C => C = -(9/2)/3 = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (-3/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2. Let me simplify this:\n\na_n = (-3/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2 = (3/2)*(3)^n * (-1)^n - 1/2.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, let's factor out the constants:\n\na_n = (-3/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) * (-1)^{n+1} - 1/2.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute it numerically for each layer instead of trying to find a closed-form formula, especially since the number of layers is manageable (only 9). So, going back to the step-by-step calculation, I think that's more straightforward and less error-prone for me.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one or two layers again to confirm.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\n3*29,524: 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can denote each inner expression as a variable to simplify. Let me try that. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me define a1 as the innermost expression and work my way outwards. So, starting from the innermost part: Let's say a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1. Similarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9, which would be the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*a9. Wait, actually, looking back, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So, if I define a1 as 1 + 3, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, until a9, and then the entire value would be 3*a9. Wait, let me check that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I let a1 = 1 + 3, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, etc., up to a9, and then the total expression is 3*a9. But wait, let me count the number of times this nesting happens. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is one level, and each subsequent level adds another 1+3*(previous level). So, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the 3, it's (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times this occurs. Starting from the first 3, the first inner expression is (1 + 3(...)), then another, and so on until the innermost is just (1 + 3). So, how many such levels are there? Let me see: each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. Let me count: after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), then inside that another (1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...)) is a new level. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3)\n\nSo, that's 9 levels, right? Because each time I see a (1+3(, that's a new level. So, from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 levels. Therefore, I can model this as a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, the total expression would be 3*a_9. So, let's try to compute each a_n step by step.\n\nStarting with a1:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with a1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000+2400=29400+123=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524. As above, that's 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check for any possible miscalculations. Let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the distributive property to compute 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nBut given that each step seems correct, I think 88572 is the right answer.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to recognize the pattern as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation to see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, which might help in computing a9 more efficiently.\n\nGiven the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have computed each a_n using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step recursive approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_n \\) where each term is built from the previous one.
