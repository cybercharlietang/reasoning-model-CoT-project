    "text": " So, there are nine layers here. To tackle this, I think I should start by evaluating the innermost part first. Let's count the number of parentheses to see where to start. The innermost part is the last set of parentheses: (1 + 3). Then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), let's compute that first. Let me write down each step as I go along. Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses. So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). Let me compute that. Step 2: Compute (1 + 3*4). So, 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). Let's compute that. Step 3: Compute (1 + 3*13). 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 = 40. So, this layer is 40. Continuing this process, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 3)). Step 4: Compute (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 = 121. So, now we have 121. Moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 4)). Step 5: Compute (1 + 3*121). Let's calculate that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 = 364. So, this layer is 364. Next, the following layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 5)). Step 6: Compute (1 + 3*364). 3*364 is... hmm, let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, this layer is 1093. Moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 6)). Step 7: Compute (1 + 3*1093). 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, this layer is 3280. Next, the following layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 7)). Step 8: Compute (1 + 3*3280). 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, this layer is 9841. Moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 8)). Step 9: Compute (1 + 3*9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Well, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, and 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, this layer is 29524. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 9)). Step 10: Compute (1 + 3*29524). Let's calculate 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, and 88560 + 12 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, this layer is 88573. Now, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 10)). Step 11: Compute (1 + 3*88573). Let's compute 3*88573. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, and 265710 + 9 = 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. So, this layer is 265720. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 11)). Step 12: Compute (1 + 3*265720). Let's calculate 3*265720. 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, 780000 + 15000 = 795000, 795000 + 2100 = 797100, and 797100 + 60 = 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161. So, this layer is 797161.

So, this layer is 2391484. Now, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 13)). Step 14: Compute (1 + 3*2391484). Let's compute 3*2391484. 3*2000000 is 6000000, 3*300000 is 900000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*400 is 1200, 3*80 is 240, and 3*4 is 12. Adding them together: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, 6900000 + 270000 = 7170000, 7170000 + 3000 = 7173000, 7173000 + 1200 = 7174200, 7174200 + 240 = 7174440, and 7174440 + 12 = 7174452. Then, 1 + 7174452 = 7174453. So, this layer is 7174453. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 14)). Step 15: Compute (1 + 3*7174453).

Adding them together: 21000000 + 300000 = 21300000, 21300000 + 210000 = 21510000, 21510000 + 12000 = 21522000, 21522000 + 1200 = 21523200, 21523200 + 150 = 21523350, and 21523350 + 9 = 21523359. Then, 1 + 21523359 = 21523360. So, this layer is 21523360. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 15)). Step 16: Compute (1 + 3*21523360).

Let's compute 3*1296625812064. 3*1000000000000 is 3000000000000, 3*200000000000 is 600000000000, 3*90000000000 is 270000000000, 3*6000000000 is 18000000000, 3*600000000 is 1800000000, 3*20000000 is 60000000, 3*5000000 is 15000000, 3*800000 is 2400000, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*200 is 600, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding them together: 3000000000000 + 600000000000 = 3600000000000, 3600000000000 + 270000000"

    "text": " So, each level is 1 plus 3 times the next level. Since it's nested nine times, I think I need to compute each level starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try to label each level for clarity. Let's denote each level as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3(...). Wait, but in the innermost part, there are no more parentheses after that. Let me check the original expression again. Wait, the innermost part is 1 + 3(...). But in the original expression, each 1 + 3 is followed by another set of parentheses. Wait, no, the innermost one is 1 + 3(...), but in the problem, the innermost is 1 + 3(...), but in the given expression, it's 1 + 3(...). Wait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). Wait, actually, let me parse the expression correctly. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and compute each level step by step. Let me try that.\n\nThe innermost part is: 1 + 3(...). But in the expression, it's written as 1 + 3(...). Wait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3(...), but in the given expression, the innermost is 1 + 3(...), but without another set inside. Wait, no, looking again, the innermost is 1 + 3(...), but in the problem, the innermost is 1 + 3(...), but in the given problem, the innermost is 1 + 3(...). Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count the number of 1 + 3(...) terms. Each time, it's 1 + 3 times another similar term. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3(...), but since it's the innermost, that ... would just be a number, not another expression. Wait, no, actually, in the given expression, each 1 + 3 is followed by another 1 + 3(...), so the innermost is 1 + 3(...), but the next one is 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on, up to nine levels.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to write the expression with each level:\n\nThe entire expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each level adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times this happens. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n...\nUp to Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Level 9)\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. So, there are nine levels of 1 + 3*(...), starting from Level 1 being 1 + 3, and each subsequent level is 1 + 3*(previous level). Then, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9.\n\nSo, let me compute each level step by step, starting from Level 1.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 *3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each level to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\n1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each level, but since the number of levels is manageable, step-by-step computation is feasible.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven a_1=4, let's see:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, Level 1 corresponds to n=1, so a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSimilarly, a_2= (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the general formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Level 9 would be a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might have saved time, especially if the number of levels were larger. But for nine levels, step-by-step is manageable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with nine levels of 1 + 3(...). By computing each level step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each level's value and finally multiply the outermost level by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Level 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Level 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Level 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Level 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Level 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Level 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Level 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Level 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Level 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Level 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers here. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost layer, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me label each layer from 1 to 9 for clarity. Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, it should build up to the final answer. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so adding them together gives 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, I think I've got the right answer here. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I just had to remember to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one, and then build my way up to the outermost layer. Each time, I multiplied the current layer's result by 3 and added 1 to get the next layer's value. Once I reached the outermost layer, I just multiplied that result by 3 to get the final answer. I didn't see any shortcuts or patterns that could simplify the calculation further, so this step-by-step approach was the way to go. It might seem long, but it's systematic and reduces the chance of making a mistake. I think I did it correctly, so I'm confident in the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let's see: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3( something ). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and then each layer wraps that with another 1+3(...). So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try that.

Continue this until all layers are computed.\n\nYes, that seems manageable. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let's start.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost expression.**\nThat's the innermost 1 + 3. So, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n**Step 2: Move one layer out.**\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n**Step 3: Next layer out.**\nNow, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39.

Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n**Step 7: Next layer.**\n1 + 3*(result from Step 6). So, 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n**Step 8: Next layer.**\n1 + 3*(result from Step 7). So, 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n**Step 9: Next layer.**\n1 + 3*(result from Step 8). So, 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break this down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so after nine layers, the innermost expression becomes 29524. But hold on, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections. From the innermost, each set adds one more layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the original expression, after the first 3(, there's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.

Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then, inside that, 1+3(...\n3. And so on.\n\nSo, each time we have a new 1+3(, that's a new layer.

So, each step I did above was one layer, starting from the innermost. So, after 9 layers, I got to 29524. But wait, in my initial steps, I went from Step 1 to Step 9, each time computing one layer. So, the result after 9 layers is 29524. But then, the entire expression is 3 times that result, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, the very first 3( is multiplying the entire expression.\n\nWait, let me confirm the structure. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, after computing all the inner layers, which resulted in 29524, that is the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that value.\n\nSo, the final step is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute 30000*3 = 90000, but since it's 29524, which is 30000 - 476. So, 3*29524 = 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - (3*476). Let me compute 3*476: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410, plus 18 is 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check another way: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. Because in the original expression, the number of layers might be different. Let me count the number of 1+3( in the expression.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3(, each subsequent term is 1+3(...). Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\n1. After the first 3(, we have 1+3(...\n2. Then inside that, 1+3(...\n3. Continuing, 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 times \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(, which would mean 9 layers. So, I think my initial computation was correct, with 9 layers, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify the number of layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me write the expression with each layer numbered.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3( inside the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, wrapping that: 1 + 3*(...)\n3. Then, wrapping that: 1 + 3*(...)\n4. And so on, until the outermost 3*(...)\n\nSo, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), that's a new layer. Let me count the number of such layers.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, yes, that's 9 layers inside, each computed step by step, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, with that in mind, my computation seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me recompute each step:\n\n**Step 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n\n**Step 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n**Step 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n**Step 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n**Step 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n**Step 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n**Step 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n**Step 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n**Step 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps, let me verify a couple of them.\n\nFor example, Step 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing all nine layers, we have the result inside the outermost parentheses, which is 29524. We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's start there. Innermost Parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 3 times that result: 3*(4) = 12. Then, the next level out is 1 + that result: 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, okay, so each time we move out a level, we take the previous result, add 1, multiply by 3, and so on. Let me try to structure this step by step. Let's assign each level a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Level 2: 3*(Level 1) = 3*4 = 12 Level 3: (1 + Level 2) = 1 + 12 = 13 Level 4: 3*(Level 3) = 3*13 = 39 Level 5: (1 + Level 4) = 1 + 39 = 40 Level 6: 3*(Level 5) = 3*40 = 120 Level 7: (1 + Level 6) = 1 + 120 = 121 Level 8: 3*(Level 7) = 3*121 = 363 Level 9: (1 + Level 8) = 1 + 363 = 364 Level 10: 3*(Level 9) = 3*364 = 1092 Wait, but hold on. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so maybe I miscounted. Let me check again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's one set, then each subsequent 3(...) adds another level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a level. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's level 1. Then each step out adds a level. So, perhaps I need to go up to level 9. Let me try that again more carefully.\n\nLet me denote each level as L1, L2, ..., L9, starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, L2 is 3*(L1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nThen, L3 is (1 + L2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL4: 3*(L3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nL5: 1 + L4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL6: 3*(L5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nL7: 1 + L6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL8: 3*(L7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nL9: 1 + L8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNow, after L9, we have the outermost 3 multiplied by L9.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(L9) = 3*364.\n\nCalculating that: 3*364.\n\nLet me compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 +12=1092.\n\nSo, the total result is 1092.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because sometimes when I count levels, I might miscount the number of operations. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n\n4. 3*13 = 39\n\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. 3*40 = 120\n\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. 3*121 = 363\n\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n\n10. 3*364 = 1092\n\nSo, actually, there are 10 steps because each time you have a multiplication by 3 and an addition of 1, except for the innermost step, which is just an addition. Wait, no, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each level alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps each level after that is either 3*(previous) or 1 + 3*(previous). Let me check the structure again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, it's 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120\n\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121\n\nThen, 3*121 = 363\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, 3*364 = 1092\n\nSo, that's 9 multiplications by 3 and 9 additions of 1, but starting from the innermost, which is an addition. Wait, no, the innermost is an addition, then each step alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then each subsequent level alternates: 3*(previous), then 1 + 3*(previous), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as each level beyond the innermost is 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then moving out, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, perhaps the number of operations is 9, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Let me try to model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, starting from the innermost, a_1 is (1 + 3) = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121, a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364, a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, but wait, that can't be because our original expression only goes up to 9 levels. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe the number of terms is 9, so we have a_1 to a_9, where a_1 is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on until a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me check that.\n\nIf a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40,\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121,\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364,\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093,\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280,\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841,\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's way different from my previous result. So, now I'm confused because depending on how I count the levels, I get different results. There must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of levels. Let me look again at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one level. Then each subsequent 3(...) adds another level. So, how many times does 3(...) occur? Let me count the number of 3(...).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each 3(...) is one level. So, from the innermost, we have:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLevel 3: (1 + Level2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 4: 3*(Level3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLevel5: 1 + Level4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel6: 3*(Level5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLevel7: 1 + Level6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel8: 3*(Level7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLevel9: 1 + Level8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel10: 3*(Level9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, perhaps the correct number of levels is nine, meaning that after the innermost, we have nine more levels, each alternating between 3*(...) and 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*4 = 12\n\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4. 3*13 = 39\n\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. 3*40 = 120\n\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. 3*121 = 363\n\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, the outermost 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, so that's nine levels beyond the initial 3, which would make the total expression 3*(Level9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nAlternatively, if I model it as a recurrence relation where each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut that can't be right because when I compute step by step, I get 1092. So, there's a discrepancy here. I must be miscounting the levels.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how many times the recurrence is applied. Let me think again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, each level beyond the innermost is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, the number of times we apply 1 + 3*(...) is eight times, because starting from the innermost, which is level 1, then level 2 is 1 + 3*level1, level3 is 1 + 3*level2, etc., up to level9, and then the outermost 3*level9.\n\nWait, so if we have nine sets of parentheses, each corresponding to a level where we have 1 + 3*(...), then the total number of times we apply the recurrence is nine times, starting from the innermost. So, let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each level as a_i, where i ranges from 1 to 9.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, when I compute step by step, I only get up to a_9 = 364, and then 3*364 = 1092. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how the expression is structured. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each step is 3*(...), except the first one which is 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, no, each level is 1 + 3*(...), except the innermost which is just 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 1 + 3*(...) expressions. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, each step out is 3*(previous result). Wait, no, the next step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to write the structure:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLevel 3: (1 + Level2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 4: 3*(Level3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLevel5: 1 + Level4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel6: 3*(Level5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLevel7: 1 + Level6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel8: 3*(Level7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLevel9: 1 + Level8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel10: 3*(Level9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nSo, in this case, the expression has nine sets of parentheses, each corresponding to a level where we have 1 + 3*(...), except the innermost which is just 1 + 3. So, the total number of 1 + 3*(...) operations is nine, leading to Level10 being the result. Therefore, the final answer is 1092.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried the recurrence relation, I ended up with 88572, which is way too big. So, I must have misapplied the recurrence. Let me check that again.\n\nIf I consider the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut this contradicts the step-by-step evaluation which gave 1092. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial term in the recurrence is wrong. Let me think about the structure again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each step out is 3*(previous result). So, Level2 = 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen, Level3 = 1 + Level2 = 13\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the next level is 1 + 3*(...). Wait, perhaps the structure alternates between 3*(...) and 1 + 3*(...). Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*(12) = 1 + 36 = 37? Wait, that doesn't make sense because in the original expression, each level after the innermost is 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps I should think of each level beyond the innermost as 1 + 3*(previous level). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*Level1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*Level2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*Level3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*Level4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*Level5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*Level6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*Level7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*Level8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Level9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier step-by-step evaluation. So, I must be misapplying the structure. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, each step is 3*(...), but the next step is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, no, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each level beyond the innermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would mean that the number of multiplications by 3 is equal to the number of levels. So, perhaps the total expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... nine times...)).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Each time, after the first 3, there's a 3 inside each parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, each level adds a 3. So, perhaps the number of 3s is equal to the number of levels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Let's try that.\n\nCompute the innermost parentheses first:\n\nStart with (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nAfter computing the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, the next level out is 3*(1 + 3*4). Wait, no, the next level is 1 + 3*(4). Wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after computing the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, the next level is 3*(1 + 3*4). Wait, no, actually, the next level is 1 + 3*(4). Wait, no, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, the next step is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify:\n\nLet me write the expression step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving out one level, we have:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nThen, moving out another level:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(39)) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nWait, but that doesn't match my earlier steps. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me write down each step clearly:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Now, moving out one level, we have 3*(1 + 3*(4)). Wait, no, the next level is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Then, moving out another level, we have 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(120) = 1 + 360 = 361.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute each level as follows:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLevel3: 1 + Level2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel4: 3*Level3 = 3*13 = 39\n\nLevel5: 1 + Level4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel6: 3*Level5 = 3*40 = 120\n\nLevel7: 1 + Level6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel8: 3*Level7 = 3*121 = 363\n\nLevel9: 1 + Level8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel10: 3*Level9 = 3*364 = 1092\n\nSo, that's ten levels, but the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so perhaps the correct result is 1092.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the expression being 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses, leading to the result 1092.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me compute it step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving out, we have 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nThen, moving out another level: 1 + 3*(12) = 1 + 36 = 37\n\nWait, that's different from before. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misaligning the levels.\n\nWait, no, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, the next level is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, moving out another level: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nWait, that's not matching my earlier steps. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a substitution method. Let me define each level as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier step-by-step evaluation. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial substitution is wrong because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so L1 is 1 + 3, L2 is 1 + 3*L1, etc., but the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial substitution should start with L1 = 3*(1 + 3*(...)), but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute each level as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each level is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, but that would mean that each level beyond the innermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would require knowing the value of the innermost first.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward, keeping track of each value.\n\nLet me try that.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next level out: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(12) = 1 + 36 = 37.\n\nWait, but that's not matching the structure because the next level should be 3*(1 + 3*(...)), not 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misaligning the operations. Let me clarify the structure.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first operation is 3*(...), where ... is (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next operation is 3*(4) = 12.\n\nThen, moving out another level, it's 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, no, because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, after computing (1 + 3) = 4, the next level is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, moving out another level, it's 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nWait, that's different from before.\n\nWait, but the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3*(...) is the outermost operation, and inside it is (1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Then, moving out, compute 3*(4) = 12.\n\n3. Then, moving out, compute (1 + 12) = 13.\n\n4. Then, moving out, compute 3*(13) = 39.\n\n5. Then, moving out, compute (1 + 39) = 40.\n\n6. Then, moving out, compute 3*(40) = 120.\n\n7. Then, moving out, compute (1 + 120) = 121.\n\n8. Then, moving out, compute 3*(121) = 363.\n\n9. Then, moving out, compute (1 + 363) = 364.\n\n10. Finally, compute 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nSo, that's ten steps, but the original expression has nine sets of parentheses. So, the final result is 1092.\n\nWait, but when I tried the recurrence relation earlier, I ended up with 88572, which must be incorrect because the step-by-step evaluation gives 1092.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1092.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by computing each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next level: 3*(4) = 12.\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n4. Next level: 3*(13) = 39.\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n6. Next level: 3*(40) = 120.\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n8. Next level: 3*(121) = 363.\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n10. Outermost: 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 1092.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Next level: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12.\n3. Next level: 1 + 12 = 13.\n4. Next level: 3 \u00d7 13 = 39.\n5. Next level: 1 + 39 = 40.\n6. Next level: 3 \u00d7 40 = 120.\n7. Next level: 1 + 120 = 121.\n8. Next level: 3 \u00d7 121 = 363.\n9. Next level: 1 + 363 = 364.\n"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers to this expression. That means I need to compute the innermost one first and then work my way out. Let me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost one: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Wait, actually, looking again, the outermost is Layer 9, but each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by (Layer 9). So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I was computing Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*9841. Let me confirm that step: 3*9841. 9841*3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, 9841*3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. That's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, putting it all together, each layer is built upon the previous one, and by computing each step methodically, I arrive at the final result. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recheck a couple of the layers. Let's say Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) where Layer 1 is 4. So, 1 + 12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 + 39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 + 120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280.

Starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer: Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(...). So, actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me check: The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from Layer 9). Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer), and so on, until we get to the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try to outline this.\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems like a lot. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4, which is 13, correct. Then 1 + 3*13 is 40, yes. Then 1 + 3*40 is 121. Then 1 + 3*121 is 364. Then 1 + 3*364 is 1093. Then 1 + 3*1093 is 3280. Then 1 + 3*3280 is 9841. Then 1 + 3*9841 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do the multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So, that seems correct. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without having to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the entire original expression as 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Yes, because 3*3^{10}=3^{11}, and 3*1=3. So, yes, that's correct. So, another way to write the final result is (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, which confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods give the same answer. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result for the given expression.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3, we get 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and working my way outwards. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part becomes 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). So, L2: 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, L2 is 13.\n\nMoving to L3: 1 + 3*(L2). That would be 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, L3 is 40.\n\nNext, L4: 1 + 3*(L3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, L4 is 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, L5 is 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 364 times 3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, L6 is 1093.\n\nMoving on to L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, L7 is 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, L8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, L9 is 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression isn't L9 itself, but rather 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, we have to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nCalculating 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer was computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. There were nine layers, each building on the previous one, and after computing the ninth layer, I multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount, let me recount the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of times \"1+3(\" appears: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, nine layers. So, I correctly went through each layer from 1 to 9 and computed each step. So, I think my process is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. However, if there were more layers, we might need a formula.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. So, my approach was correct.\n\nI can also check my computations for each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and moving outward. Let me number the parentheses from the inside out to keep track. So, the innermost is Parenthesis 1: (1 + 3). Then Parenthesis 2: (1 + 3(...)), and so on until Parenthesis 9, which is the outermost. Let me try to compute each level step by step. Starting with Parenthesis 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving outward to Parenthesis 2: (1 + 3*(result of Parenthesis 1)). Since Parenthesis 1 is 4, Parenthesis 2 becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Parenthesis 2 equals 13. Next, Parenthesis 3: (1 + 3*(result of Parenthesis 2)). Parenthesis 2 is 13, so Parenthesis 3 is (1 + 3*13). Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Parenthesis 3 is 40. Moving on to Parenthesis 4: (1 + 3*(result of Parenthesis 3)). Parenthesis 3 is 40, so Parenthesis 4 becomes (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Parenthesis 4 is 121. Now, Parenthesis 5: (1 + 3*(result of Parenthesis 4)). Parenthesis 4 is 121, so Parenthesis 5 is (1 + 3*121). Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Parenthesis 5 is 364. Next, Parenthesis 6: (1 + 3*(result of Parenthesis 5)). Parenthesis 5 is 364, so Parenthesis 6 is (1 + 3*364). Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Parenthesis 6 is 1093. Moving to Parenthesis 7: (1 + 3*(result of Parenthesis 6)). Parenthesis 6 is 1093, so Parenthesis 7 is (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Parenthesis 7 is 3280. Now, Parenthesis 8: (1 + 3*(result of Parenthesis 7)). Parenthesis 7 is 3280, so Parenthesis 8 is (1 + 3*3280). Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Parenthesis 8 is 9841. Finally, Parenthesis 9: (1 + 3*(result of Parenthesis 8)). Parenthesis 8 is 9841, so Parenthesis 9 is (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Parenthesis 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Parenthesis 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, hold on, let me check that again because 29524 is 29,524, right? So, 3*29,524. Let me break it down: 3*20,000 is 60,000, 3*9,000 is 27,000, 3*500 is 1,500, 3*24 is 72. Adding all these: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just quickly recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent step was 1 + 3*(previous result). I calculated each step as follows: 1 + 3*4 = 13; 1 + 3*13 = 40; 1 + 3*40 = 121; 1 + 3*121 = 364; 1 + 3*364 = 1093; 1 + 3*1093 = 3280; 1 + 3*3280 = 9841; 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, multiplied the outermost 3: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors, but just to be thorough, let me verify a couple of the steps. Let's check Parenthesis 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Parenthesis 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Parenthesis 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Parenthesis 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Parenthesis 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 *3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding those: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my answer is right. The key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward, computing each step carefully. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down one at a time made it manageable. I didn't try to compute all at once because that would have been confusing and prone to errors. Taking it step by step is the way to go for such nested expressions. So, after all that, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine sets of parentheses, each containing 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parenthesis (1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Parenthesis (2):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Parenthesis (3):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Parenthesis (4):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Parenthesis (5):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Parenthesis (6):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Parenthesis (7):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Parenthesis (8):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Parenthesis (9):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, and so on, up to Level 9. That might help me keep track. Starting with Level 1: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, Level 2 would be 3 times the result of Level 1 plus 1. Wait, no, actually, looking back at the expression, each level is 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1). So, Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, okay, so Level 2 is 13. Now, Level 3 would be 1 + 3*(Level 2). So, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Level 3 is 40. Moving on to Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4 is 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Now, Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. So 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might slip up. Let me verify each level again: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " So, there are nine layers here. That seems like a lot, but maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try to parse this expression step by step. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, the layer above that is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, okay. So, each time, I take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that gives me the next layer's value. Let me try to formalize this. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Wait, hold on. Let me double-check these calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOkay, so L9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Let me check the original expression again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, when I computed L9, that was the innermost part, right? So, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's see: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me verify whether I correctly identified how many layers there are and whether I applied the operations correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) is a layer. So, let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n10. ...1+3)))\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me see: each time I see a \"(\", it's a new layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3)))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each inside the previous one. So, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3). Then layer 8 is 1 + 3*(layer9), layer7 is 1 + 3*(layer8), and so on, up to layer1, which is 1 + 3*(layer2), and then the entire expression is 3*(layer1). So, when I computed up to layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, that gives 88572. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer1: 4. Then, each step out is another layer, so layer2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me do that multiplication again to make sure:\n\n29524\n\ntimes 3\n\n------------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*r^n, where r is the root of the characteristic equation. For the equation L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the characteristic equation is r = a, so L_n^h = C*a^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a).\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*a^n + K.\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = 1. So, K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of the closed-form formula, it would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to think about it, using the closed-form expression. That might have been a quicker way, but since I was doing it step by step, the iterative approach worked too.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer to the problem.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n2. Substitute back and compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   L_1 &= 4 \\\\\n   L_2 &= 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\\\\n   L_3 &= 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\\\\n   L_4 &= 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\\\\n   L_5 &= 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\\\\n   L_6 &= 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\\\\n   L_7 &= 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\\\\n   L_8 &= 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\\\\n   L_9 &= 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n3. Multiply the outermost 3 by \\(L_9\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers here. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me start by evaluating the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). So, substituting the result we just got, it becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the second innermost expression evaluates to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13 first, which is 39, then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. Alright, so the third layer from the inside is 40. Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me see if I can write this as a sequence, maybe that will help me see the pattern more clearly. Let's define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me denote the innermost expression as a\u2081, then the next one as a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers. So, a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait a minute, so each a\u2099 is defined as 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting with a\u2081 = 4. So, each term is generated by multiplying the previous term by 3 and then adding 1. That looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099 instead of computing each term step by step, which would save time, especially if there were more layers. Let me think about how to solve this recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence relation is a\u2099 = c*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c is 3 and d is 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The formula is a\u2099 = (a\u2081 - d/c) * c^(n-1) + d/(c - 1). Let me verify that. Alternatively, another way to approach it is to recognize that this is a geometric series. Let me try to expand a few terms to see the pattern. a\u2081 = 4. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40. Wait, that's not quite right. Let me compute a\u2083 correctly. Wait, a\u2082 is 13, so a\u2083 is 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Similarly, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, so each a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. Let me try to write out the terms in terms of a\u2081. So, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a\u2081) = 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2*a\u2081. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3\u00b2*a\u2081) = 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2 + 3\u00b3*a\u2081. I see a pattern here. Each a\u2099 can be expressed as the sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k plus 3^(n) * a\u2081. But since a\u2081 is 4, which is 1 + 3, maybe I can represent it as 3^1 + 1. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express a\u2099 as a geometric series. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a\u2099 = c*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + d is a\u2099 = (a\u2081 - d/(c-1)) * c^(n-1) + d/(c - 1). Let me plug in the values. Here, c = 3, d = 1. So, the solution would be a\u2099 = (a\u2081 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^(n-1) + 1/(3-1). Simplifying, that's a\u2099 = (a\u2081 - 1/2) * 3^(n-1) + 1/2. Now, since a\u2081 is 4, substituting that in: a\u2099 = (4 - 1/2) * 3^(n-1) + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^(n-1) + 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1, a\u2081 should be 4. Plugging n=1: (7/2)*3^(0) + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, a\u2082 should be 13. Plugging n=2: (7/2)*3^(1) + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, that's not matching because a\u2082 is 13. Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my formula. Let me try again. Maybe I made an error in deriving the formula. Let me go back. The standard approach for solving a linear recurrence relation a\u2099 = c*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + d is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a\u2099 - c*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the solution a\u2099^h = A*c^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can assume a particular solution a\u2099^p = B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = c*B + d. Solving for B: B - c*B = d => B*(1 - c) = d => B = d/(1 - c). So, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*c^n + B. Applying initial conditions: at n=1, a\u2081 = 4. So, 4 = A*c^1 + B => 4 = A*c + B. Since c=3, we have 4 = 3A + B. And from the particular solution, B = d/(1 - c) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, substituting B = -1/2 into the equation: 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a\u2099 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, the nth term is a\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a\u2089 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 divided by 2 is 29524. So, a\u2089 = 29524. Now, looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(a\u2089). Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a\u2089, right? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), so the entire expression is 3 times the innermost expression, which is a\u2089. Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), where the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a\u2081. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a\u2089), because a\u2089 is the innermost term, and each layer is built upon that. Wait, no, actually, in our definition earlier, a\u2081 is the innermost, so a\u2082 is the next layer, and so on up to a\u2089, which is the outermost layer. Wait, no, perhaps I got that reversed. Let me clarify. Let me think of the expression as starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is the innermost, which is a\u2081. Then, moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which is a\u2082. So, each a\u2099 is the nth layer from the inside. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is the entire expression, is a\u2089. Wait, but the original problem is 3*(a\u2089). Because the problem starts with 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, the entire nested expression is a\u2089, which is 29524, and then we multiply that by 3. Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, in the original problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost part is (1 + 3). So, if I denote the innermost as a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 13, and so on, up to a\u2089 = 29524. But the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, because the original problem is 3*(a\u2089). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me confirm that. Because the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is 3 times the entire nested part. The nested part is a\u2089, which is 29524, so 3*29524 is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of a\u2099. Let me check again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a\u2081 = 4. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, so a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 13, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 40, and so on, up to a\u2089 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check that again. Because when I expand the original expression, it's 3*(a\u2089), where a\u2089 is 29524, so yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3. Let's see: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are nine instances of (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean that a\u2089 is the innermost, and the entire expression is 3*a\u2089. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me confirm that with the earlier calculations. When I computed a\u2089 as 29524, that was the value of the innermost expression, but in the problem, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, yes, 3*29524 is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me compute a\u2089 again using the formula a\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that's correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me cross-verify this with a different approach, just to be sure. Let me compute the expression step by step without using the formula, just to see if I get the same result. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, after nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the formula approach. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\), leading to a sequence that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we find that the innermost expression after nine layers is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. To tackle this, I think I should start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and then work my way outwards. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's say:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3(...))\n3. Continue this until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 2: Compute (1 + 3*4). Wait, 3 times 4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so the next layer evaluates to 13. Now, moving out another layer.\n\nStep 3: Compute (1 + 3*13). Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, so now we have 40. Next layer out.\n\nStep 4: Compute (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, this seems to be growing quickly. Let me keep going.\n\nStep 5: Compute (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWhoa, that's a big jump. Step 6 is next.\n\nStep 6: Compute (1 + 3*364). Let's calculate 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, that's a large number. Let's proceed to step 7.\n\nStep 7: Compute (1 + 3*1093). First, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nOkay, moving on to step 8.\n\nStep 8: Compute (1 + 3*3280). Let's calculate 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nAlright, now step 9, which is the outermost parentheses.\n\nStep 9: Compute (1 + 3*9841). Let me calculate 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, after evaluating all the parentheses, the innermost to the outermost, we've arrived at 29524 inside the outermost parentheses. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, we have 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, all the steps check out. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. So, the process seems correct. Therefore, I think 88572 is the right answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression without having to compute each step manually. It seems like each layer is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each step as a term in a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089. So, each term is defined as a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, maybe using the method for solving linear difference equations.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4. So, 4 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the initial terms to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a\u2083 = (3\u2074 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3\u00b9\u2070: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result we got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used a recursive formula, and even derived a general term for the sequence, which gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent term is \\( a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). \n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and working my way out. Let me assign a variable to each level to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Then the entire expression is 3(Level 9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression starts with 3 multiplied by (Level 9). So, the total expression is 3*(Level 9). So, if I compute each Level from 1 to 9, I can substitute each into the next level. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. So, 1 + 3 is 4.\n\nNow, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 3 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let me break this down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLevel 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524*3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is actually 88572? Let me verify that with another method. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but wait, let me check with another method because 29524*3 seems high.\n\nWait, 29524*3: Let's compute 30000*3 = 90000, minus (30000 - 29524)*3 = 476*3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems like a big number. Let me verify my calculations step by step because I might have made an error in one of the levels.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 +3(...). So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's one level, then each subsequent level adds another layer. So, yes, nine levels. So, Level 9 is the outermost, which is 1 +3*(Level8). So, the final expression is 3*(Level9). So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each Level n is defined as 1 + 3*(Level n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me try to find a general formula for Level n.\n\nLet me denote L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) +1, with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r=3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1.\n\nSolving for A: A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1)=4.\n\nSo, L(1)= C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C =4 +1/2= 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Level n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: L(1)= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Level n=9 is (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Level9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 ). Let me compute that:\n\n3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's reassuring.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times. The answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each level is defined as 1 plus three times the next level. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recursive formula, each level can be computed step by step. The final result after expanding all levels and multiplying by three is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers here. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost layer and moving outward. Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). So, let's compute that first. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. So, that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(...)). But since the innermost part is now 4, the next layer is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4. First, I should do the multiplication before addition, so 3*4 = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 13, so this becomes (1 + 3*13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, this layer is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each time, we're taking 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, so each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, starting from 4, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That seems like a geometric sequence or something. Let me confirm the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so after computing each layer, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. So, the entire expression simplifies to 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's breaking down 29524 into its place values, which is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, each part multiplied by 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add all those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom up: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that gives 88572, which matches my earlier result. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again just to be thorough.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the ninth layer is 29524, and then we multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). So, starting from the innermost term, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nI can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1.\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, for the ninth layer, n = 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3 = 177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer simplifies to a value that is used in the next outer layer. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently.

    "text": " So, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost one. So, starting from the inside: L9: 1 + 3( ) Well, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because after L9, it's just 1 + 3, without any more parentheses. Wait, no, let me check. The innermost part is 1 + 3( ), but the next layer is 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), so actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3. Let me confirm: the innermost parentheses is 1 + 3, then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(result from previous layer). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nContinuing: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's L1. Then each subsequent layer is L2, L3, up to L9. But when I worked through the layers, I ended up with 88573. Let me check if that's correct by going through each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). So, the outermost layer is 3*(L9). So, the total expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I thought L9 was 29524, so 3*L9 is 88572. But in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial calculation, I went up to L9 as 29524, and then I thought that was the end, but actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so I need to multiply that 29524 by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, let me correct that. So, after computing L9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought I had 8 layers, but the problem has nine layers, so maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer, which is 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers because the expression starts with 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me try to count how many times 1+3*(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) before the outermost 3.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time I add another 1+3*(...), so starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nAfter the first 3(, we have:\n\n1. (1+3(\n\n2. (1+3(\n\n3. (1+3(\n\n4. (1+3(\n\n5. (1+3(\n\n6. (1+3(\n\n7. (1+3(\n\n8. (1+3(\n\n9. (1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, I need to compute 9 layers, starting from the innermost. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me compute each layer step by step, from L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we also arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*next layer.\n\nIf I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), but that's a bit circular. Alternatively, each layer can be expressed as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which we've already solved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nEach time we have a term like 3^k, starting from k=1 up to k=9, but I'm not sure. Let me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each layer as contributing a 3^k term.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression from the inside out:\n\nStarting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 3*3 + 3*1 = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13\n\nWait, but that might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps each layer adds another power of 3.\n\nWait, let me think differently. If I consider the expression E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ), but wait, that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, from the closed-form solution, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then E = 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ), which would be 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to express it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent it as a sum: 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nWait, let me test that idea. Let me compute the sum S = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}. The sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where a=3, r=3, n=10 terms.\n\nSo, S = 3*(3^{10} -1)/(3-1) = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as our result.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the entire expression E is equal to the sum S = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}.\n\nBut wait, let me check that by expanding the original expression.\n\nLet me try expanding E step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand the innermost part:\n\nStart with the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, as we computed earlier, each layer adds 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but when we compute E, it's 3*(L9), where L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nThen E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11} is 177147, so E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}, that's a geometric series with 10 terms, first term 3, ratio 3.\n\nSum S = 3*(3^{10} -1)/(3-1) = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the expression E is equal to the sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=10.\n\nBut wait, does that make sense? Let me see.\n\nWhen I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me try expanding it:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*29524=88572.\n\nNow, let's see if that's equal to the sum 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}.\n\nCompute 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683 + 59049.\n\nLet me add them up step by step:\n\n3 + 9 =12\n\n12 +27=39\n\n39 +81=120\n\n120 +243=363\n\n363 +729=1092\n\n1092 +2187=3279\n\n3279 +6561=9840\n\n9840 +19683=29523\n\n29523 +59049=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as E. Therefore, E is indeed equal to the sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=10, which is 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series.\n\nBut in the problem, we had to compute the expression step by step, so the step-by-step approach is also valid.\n\nIn summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step, and then multiplying the outermost 3, we arrive at the result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(...).

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the next inner expression. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: (1 + 3) Then Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, looking back, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). That's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. So 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, is that right? Let me check my calculations again because 29524*3. Let me do it another way: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So that gives 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go through each layer again quickly to see if I made any errors. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3 times that expression. Let me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let's define each layer as a step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nStep 4: Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nStep 5: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 4). That's 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nStep 6: Next, 1 + 3*(result from Step 5).

That would be 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 7). So, 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nStep 9: Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 8). That is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 first. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 to that: 29523 + 1 is 29524.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations for each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems to add up correctly. Now, the entire expression is 3 times the outermost result, right? Wait, hold on. Let me check the original problem again. It says: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, after computing the innermost parentheses all the way out to Step 9, which gave me 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in the problem, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested parentheses. So, I think I may have miscalculated. Let me clarify: The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, when I computed up to Step 9, I was computing the entire nested part, which is the argument inside the outermost 3*(...). So, the total expression would be 3*(29524). Wait, no, that can't be. Because in my steps, I was computing each layer as 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the first step was the innermost, and each step built up the next layer. So, the outermost layer is 3*(result from Step 9). Wait, but in my earlier steps, I thought Step 9 was the outermost, but actually, in the problem, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps I need to compute the nested part first, which is 1 + 3*(...), and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. The problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, there's one (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...) appears. The innermost is (1 + 3). Then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost, that's layer 1: (1 + 3). Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1). Then layer3: 1 + 3*(layer2). And so on, until the outermost layer, which is layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, that means after computing layer9, I have to multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, in my earlier steps, I computed up to layer9 as 29524, but actually, that's the value of (1 + 3*(...)), so the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought that layer9 was the outermost, but actually, the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, let me correct that. So, after computing layer9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524. So, let's compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to layer9, I thought that was the total, but actually, the total is 3 times that. So, my final answer is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Let me write them out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3. So, my calculation is correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify by computing each step again, just to be thorough.\n\nLet me write down each step again, carefully:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I also arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})\\). By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed as a geometric series. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me count how many innermost layers there are. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because that's the last one before the closing parenthesis. So, let's start there. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4. So, that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 simplifies to 13. Moving out another layer, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me check one of the layers again. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are right.

    "text": " So, there are nine layers here. That means I need to compute the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let's label each layer for clarity. Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so it's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364. Hmm, 364 times 3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Therefore, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Thus, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29524, so the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12.

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this 1 + 3(...) structure, each multiplied by 3. Hmm, okay, so maybe I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let's start by identifying the innermost parentheses. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out one layer, it's (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the result of the innermost part. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. I'll label each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9. Wait, actually, maybe it's the other way around. Let me check. The innermost parentheses are the last ones, so maybe I should start from the innermost and move outwards. So, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, so Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be (1 + 3*(Layer 1)). So, that's (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is (1 + 3*(Layer 2)). So, that's (1 + 3*13). 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that becomes the next layer's value. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. So far, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can see a pattern or perhaps find a formula. Layer 4: (1 + 3*Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280.

So, starting from Layer 1: 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. So, now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested structure, which is Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next digit: 0 (since there's nothing left, but the carryover is 2, so write that down). Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number. Wait, let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 8, 8, 5, 7, 2, but wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 would be 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524. 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, carryover 1. 9 + 9 = 18 +1=19, carryover 1. 2 +2=4 +1=5. So, 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add them. 59048 + 29524. 8 +4=12, write 2, carryover 1. 4 +2=6 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Hmm, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3\u00d74) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3\u00d713) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3\u00d740) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3\u00d7121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3\u00d7364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3\u00d71093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3\u00d73280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3\u00d79841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) nine times. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, it's like a geometric series. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me recall that for such expressions, where each term is a + b*(next term), you can model it as a recurrence relation. Specifically, if we let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, actually, in our case, the innermost term is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as we computed. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can solve the equation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me write down the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used two different methods (direct computation and recurrence formula) to arrive at the same answer. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers. By solving each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the final value efficiently. The result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) Now, the next layer out is (1 + 3(4)). Let's compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))) Now, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3(13)). Let's compute that: 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))) Now, the next layer is (1 + 3(40)). Calculating that: 3 times 40 is 120, and 1 plus 120 is 121. So, replacing that, the expression is now: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))) Moving outward, we have (1 + 3(121)). Let's compute that: 3 times 121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))) Next layer: (1 + 3(364)). Calculating: 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, now the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))) Moving outward again: (1 + 3(1093)). 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280))) Next layer: (1 + 3(3280)). 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, now the expression is: 3(1 + 3(9841)) Moving outward: (1 + 3(9841)). 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(29524) Now, the last layer is just 3 multiplied by 29524. Let's compute that: 3 times 29524. Hmm, let me do that step by step. 29524 times 3. 4 times 3 is 12, carry over the 1. 2 times 3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 5 times 3 is 15, carry over the 1. 9 times 3 is 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. 2 times 3 is 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me write it out vertically:\n\n```\n  29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n```\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, let me verify using another method. 29524 \u00d7 3. 29524 \u00d7 2 is 59048, plus 29524 is 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. It's easy to make an error when dealing with so many layers.\n\nLet me go through each step again quickly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. So, each step seems to be correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I could have recognized to solve it more quickly without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, maybe I can find a general formula.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n represents the value of the nth layer from the inside out. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers.\n\nSo, the sequence is defined recursively by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, except for the constant term. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works for all the values I computed earlier. So, for the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. That also checks out.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3(...), and so on, until the outermost layer. So, perhaps I can compute this by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, simplifying each layer one by one. Let me try that. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Starting with L1: L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, which is L2: L2: 1 + 3(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Next layer, L3: L3: 1 + 3(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay. Let me keep going to see the pattern. L4: 1 + 3(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5: 1 + 3(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6: 1 + 3(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7: 1 + 3(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8: 1 + 3(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9: 1 + 3(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression isn't just L9; it's 3 times L9. So, after computing L9 as 29524, we have to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Hmm, let me just make sure I did all those calculations correctly. Sometimes when I do a lot of steps, I might make a mistake in one of them, so it's good to double-check. Let me go through each layer again quickly. L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can help me compute this without doing each step manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I know that such relations can often be solved using standard techniques. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, that's a_1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, that's a_2. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct, that's a_3. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^5 is 243, so 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243. Hmm, 240*240 = 57,600. Then, 240*3 = 720, so 243*243 is (240 + 3)^2 = 240^2 + 2*240*3 + 3^2 = 57,600 + 1,440 + 9 = 59,049. So, 3^{10} = 59,049. Then, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for L9. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, I could express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59,049 - 1)/2 = 3*59,048/2 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, which is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirmed the step-by-step method. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically simplifying each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a general formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently.

So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9, which is (1 + 3). Then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9), and so on, until Layer 1, which is multiplied by the outermost 3. Hmm, maybe I should number them from the inside out. Let me try that. Let's define Layer 1 as the innermost (1 + 3), Layer 2 as the next one, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, no, that might not be the right approach. Let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, we have 3*(something). The innermost something is (1 + 3). Then the next one is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)). So, perhaps it's better to compute from the innermost outward, each time calculating the value inside and then substituting it into the next layer. Let me try that approach. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses first. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 1 (innermost) is 4, Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Continuing this way, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572, so adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost: (1+3)=4. Then 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Then 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Then 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Then 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Then 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Then 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Then 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Then 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Finally, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it faster. Each layer seems to be following a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me write down the sequence of layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nAnd then 3*29524=88572.\n\nLooking at this sequence, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3 and an additive constant of 1. The general formula for such a sequence is a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1) + (r^(n-1) - 1)/(r - 1), where a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, a_1=4, r=3, and n=9 layers. Let me check if that formula works for the first few terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=4. Formula gives 4*3^(0) + (3^(0)-1)/(3-1)=4*1 + (1-1)/2=4+0=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=13. Formula gives 4*3^(1) + (3^(1)-1)/(3-1)=12 + (3-1)/2=12 + 1=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=40. Formula gives 4*3^2 + (3^2 -1)/(3-1)=4*9 + (9-1)/2=36 + 4=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\na_9=4*3^(8) + (3^8 -1)/(3-1).\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9=4*6561 + (6561 -1)/2=4*6561 + 6560/2=26244 + 3280=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, it's like a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Wait, but E itself is 3 times a similar expression, but how many layers does that have? Wait, no, because each time you go inside, the number of layers decreases by one. Wait, maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3). Then, E_2 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), with two layers inside. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the notation. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as E = 3*(1 + E'), where E' is the expression with one fewer layer. But perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3, perhaps I can write a general formula for E_n.\n\nWait, another approach: Each time you add a layer, you're effectively doing E_{n} = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), where E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. Wait, but in our case, E_1 is the innermost, which is 4, but multiplied by 3. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as each layer being 1 + 3*previous_layer, starting from the innermost. So, as I did before, starting from 4, then 13, 40, etc., up to Layer 9=29524, then E=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant to be determined. Let me try to find B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, assume a constant solution a_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just confirm once more to be absolutely sure. Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and after 9 layers, we have 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Yep, that seems correct. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outward, we find each subsequent value and substitute it into the next layer until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term, repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**: Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n3. **Work Outwards Layer by Layer**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), I can compute each layer one by one. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost: (1 + 3) Layer 2 is the next one: (1 + 3(Layer 1)) Layer 3 is (1 + 3(Layer 2)) and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Hmm, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Okay, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Therefore, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Well, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. I don't see any errors in my multiplications or additions.

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this. Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as follows: Let me number them from the inside out. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost expression: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12. Then, Layer 2 is part of the next expression, which is (1 + Layer 2). So, Layer 3: (1 + 12) = 13. Then, Layer 3 is multiplied by 3: Layer 4: 3*13 = 39. Then, Layer 4 is part of the next expression: Layer 5: (1 + 39) = 40. Multiply by 3: Layer 6: 3*40 = 120. Next, Layer 6 is inside another (1 + ...), so Layer 7: (1 + 120) = 121. Multiply by 3: Layer 8: 3*121 = 363. Then, Layer 8 is inside another (1 + ...), so Layer 9: (1 + 363) = 364. Multiply by 3: Layer 10: 3*364 = 1092. Wait, but let me check if I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so maybe I'm overcounting the layers. Let me recount. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each time we go outward, we add another layer. So, let's count the layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: 3*(result from 1)\n3. Then: (1 + result from 2)\n4. Next: 3*(result from 3)\n5. Then: (1 + result from 4)\n6. Next: 3*(result from 5)\n7. Then: (1 + result from 6)\n8. Next: 3*(result from 7)\n9. Then: (1 + result from 8)\n10. Next: 3*(result from 9)\n\nWait, that's 10 layers, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me try again. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8)\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so maybe the total layers are nine.

Then, each 3*(...) is a new layer. So, perhaps it's nine layers in total. Let me try to compute each step carefully, making sure I don't skip any.\n\nLet me start over, this time keeping track of each step as I move outward:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12\n3. Next layer: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39\n5. Next layer: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120\n7. Next layer: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363\n9. Next layer: (1 + 363) = 364\n10. Next layer: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nWait, so after nine layers, I get to 364, and then the final multiplication by 3 gives 1092. But the original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so maybe the total number of layers is nine, meaning that the final result after the ninth layer is 364, and then the outermost 3*(...) would be the tenth layer, giving 1092. But let me check the original expression again to confirm how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears.

(1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) = 12\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n4. 3*(13) = 39\n5. (1 + 39) = 40\n6. 3*(40) = 120\n7. (1 + 120) = 121\n8. 3*(121) = 363\n9. (1 + 363) = 364\n10. 3*(364) = 1092\n\nBut wait, the original expression ends with the ninth 3(, so the last operation is 3*(...). Therefore, the result after nine layers would be 364, and then the outermost 3*(364) would be the tenth layer, giving 1092. But let me check the original expression again to make sure.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each time we have 3*(...), and after nine such layers, we have 3*(...). So, the total number of 3*(...) is nine, which would mean that the final result is 3*(...), which is the tenth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute it step by step, writing down each layer as I go.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, S3, etc., where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(S1):\n\nS2: 3*4 = 12\n\nNext layer: (1 + S2):\n\nS3: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 3*S3:\n\nS4: 3*13 = 39\n\nNext layer: 1 + S4:\n\nS5: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext layer: 3*S5:\n\nS6: 3*40 = 120\n\nNext layer: 1 + S6:\n\nS7: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext layer: 3*S7:\n\nS8: 3*121 = 363\n\nNext layer: 1 + S8:\n\nS9: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext layer: 3*S9:\n\nS10: 3*364 = 1092\n\nSo, according to this, the final result is 1092. But let me check if I have nine layers of 3*(...). The original expression has nine sets of 3*(...), so S2 to S10 would be those nine layers, right? Wait, S2 is the first 3*(...), so S10 would be the ninth layer. Wait, no, because S2 is the first 3*(...), then S4 is the second, S6 the third, S8 the fourth, S10 the fifth, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps each time we have a 3*(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from S1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen S2: 3*(S1) = 12\n\nThen S3: (1 + S2) = 13\n\nThen S4: 3*(S3) = 39\n\nThen S5: (1 + S4) = 40\n\nThen S6: 3*(S5) = 120\n\nThen S7: (1 + S6) = 121\n\nThen S8: 3*(S7) = 363\n\nThen S9: (1 + S8) = 364\n\nThen S10: 3*(S9) = 1092\n\nSo, each 3*(...) is a new layer. So, the original expression has nine 3*(...) layers, which would correspond to S2, S4, S6, S8, S10, but wait, that's only five layers. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps each 3*(...) is a separate layer. Let me count the number of 3*(...) in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a 3*(...), that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first 3*(...) is the outermost one: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3*(...): 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on, until the ninth 3*(...).\n\nSo, there are nine layers of 3*(...). Each of these layers will be computed as we go inward.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, so Layer 10 is the ninth 3*(...) because we started counting from Layer 2 as the first 3*(...). So, the ninth 3*(...) would be Layer 10, giving us 1092 as the final result.\n\nLet me confirm this by working through each step again:\n\n1. Start with (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Multiply by 3: 4*3 = 12\n3. Add 1: 12 + 1 = 13\n4. Multiply by 3: 13*3 = 39\n5. Add 1: 39 + 1 = 40\n6. Multiply by 3: 40*3 = 120\n7. Add 1: 120 + 1 = 121\n8. Multiply by 3: 121*3 = 363\n9. Add 1: 363 + 1 = 364\n10. Multiply by 3: 364*3 = 1092\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. So, the final result is 1092.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I carefully checked each operation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 1092.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. Add 1:\n   \\[\n   1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 13 = 39\n   \\]\n\n5. Add 1:\n   \\[\n   1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n6. Multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 40 = 120\n   \\]\n\n7. Add 1:\n   \\[\n   1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n8. Multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 121 = 363\n   \\]\n\n9. Add 1:\n   \\[\n   1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n10. Multiply by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 364 = 1092\n    \\]\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1092}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers here. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let's denote each layer as follows to keep track: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost one: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, actually, looking back at the problem, the outermost term is 3*(...), so maybe the outermost layer is Layer 10? Hmm, maybe I should count them again. Let me try to parse the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost is (1 + 3). Then moving outward, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs. Let's see: Starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers of (1 + 3*(...)) before the outermost 3*(...). Let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time I have (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, maybe it's better to approach it by starting from the innermost and working outward, calculating each step as I go.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost parentheses first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3: Let's compute step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3.\n\n29000*3 = 87000.\n\n524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572.\n\nAdding together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers because it's easy to make a mistake when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the right answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's say each layer is defined recursively as:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as L(1).\n\nSo, L(1) = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n > 1.\n\nSo, the expression we're computing is 3*L(9).\n\nLet me compute L(1) through L(9):\n\nL(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see.\n\nSince L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nThen, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*L(9) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly enough, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times the value of the outermost layer. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a closed-form formula, the final result is computed as 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sum where each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(next inner layer).

    "text": " So, it's like a chain of nine 1 + 3(...) expressions, each nested inside the previous one. To make it easier, maybe I can compute each layer starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let's assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost and layer 9 is the outermost. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3), layer 2 is (1 + 3*(result of layer 1)), layer 3 is (1 + 3*(result of layer 2)), and so on, up to layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(result of layer 9). Let me try this approach. I'll start by computing layer 1: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Layer 2: (1 + 3*(result of layer 1)) = (1 + 3*4) = (1 + 12) = 13 Good, moving on. Layer 3: (1 + 3*(result of layer 2)) = (1 + 3*13) = (1 + 39) = 40 Hmm, that's a bigger jump. Layer 4: (1 + 3*(result of layer 3)) = (1 + 3*40) = (1 + 120) = 121 Wow, it's increasing rapidly. Layer 5: (1 + 3*(result of layer 4)) = (1 + 3*121) = (1 + 363) = 364 Okay, getting even larger. Layer 6: (1 + 3*(result of layer 5)) = (1 + 3*364) = (1 + 1092) = 1093 Layer 7: (1 + 3*(result of layer 6)) = (1 + 3*1093) = (1 + 3279) = 3280 Layer 8: (1 + 3*(result of layer 7)) = (1 + 3*3280) = (1 + 9840) = 9841 Layer 9: (1 + 3*(result of layer 8)) = (1 + 3*9841) = (1 + 29523) = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(result of layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it together: 7 7 8 5 2. Wait, that would be 77852? Hmm, that doesn't match my previous result. I must have messed up the place values. Let me write it properly:\n\n  29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, no, that's 88572? But when I did the digit-wise multiplication, I ended up with 88572. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the place values earlier. Let me check:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. But earlier, when I broke it down, I thought 29524 \u00d73 is 88572. So, that's correct. But when I first did it, I thought it was 88572, but when I did the digit-wise, I thought it was 88572 as well. Wait, so why did I think I had a mistake? Maybe I confused it with another number. Anyway, 29524 \u00d73 is indeed 88572. So, the entire expression equals 88572. Let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and working my way outwards. Let me number the parentheses from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3), layer 2 is 3*(result of layer 1) + 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on up to layer 9. But wait, actually, the expression is built as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, which is Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29500 is 88500, and 3*24 is 72, so adding those together: 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 3*(1 + 3*(...)) nine times might have a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe there's a geometric series or something here. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the sequence is defined recursively. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. So, the nth term would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant B, so plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 = 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a term in a geometric sequence, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually or using the formula is feasible. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost result by 3. Using both iterative computation and a formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this structure. Maybe if I start evaluating from the innermost layer and work my way out, it'll become manageable. Let me try that approach. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*13 is 39, and then adding 1 gives me 40. So, this layer simplifies to 40. Continuing this process, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let's see, 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that layer becomes 121. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 364. So, this layer is 364. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, this layer simplifies to 1093. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives me 9841. So, this layer becomes 9841. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that layer simplifies to 29524. Finally, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, the entire inner expression simplifies to 88573. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the original expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 3*88573: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 265719. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13, 1 + 3*13 = 40, 1 + 3*40 = 121, 1 + 3*121 = 364, 1 + 3*364 = 1093, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Then, 3*88573 = 265719. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and the numbers add up. I don't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 265719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

    "text": " So, it's like a chain of operations where each step depends on the next. To tackle this, I think I should start evaluating from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me number the parentheses from the inside out to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is the 9th set: 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each set will build on the previous one. So, I can start by computing the innermost expression first and then use that result in the next layer, and so on, until I reach the outermost layer. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. **9th layer:** 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from 9th layer). \n\n2. **8th layer:** 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the 8th layer simplifies to 13.\n\n3. **7th layer:** Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number. Let me break it down:\n\n   - 9000 * 3 = 27000\n   - 800 * 3 = 2400\n   - 40 * 3 = 120\n   - 1 * 3 = 3\n   Now, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 29523. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to slip up with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. 3*9841 = 29523. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems like each step checks out. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or look for a pattern. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nIn general, expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers. In this case, we have 9 layers. Starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, that's different from the 29523 I got earlier. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I computed up to a_9 as 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523.\n\nBut using the recurrence formula, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*29524=88572. Wait, that's not matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the closed-form solution. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result of the innermost expression. Wait, actually, in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, the outermost layer is 3 times the result of the innermost expression. So, in terms of the a_n I defined, a_9 is the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3*(...). Wait, no, actually, in my earlier definition, a_1 was the innermost, which is 1 + 3. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, etc., up to a_9=29524.\n\nBut the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*29524=88572. But that contradicts my initial computation of 29523.\n\nWait, so I'm confused now. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nIn the initial step-by-step computation, I computed a_9 as 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. But according to the closed-form formula, a_9 is 29524, so 3*a_9 would be 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step computation, I only went up to a_9=9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1=4. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524.\n\nBut the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524=88572. But in my initial computation, I stopped at a_9=9841 and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. That was incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let's recount the layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, in my initial computation, I computed up to Layer9=9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. But according to the closed-form, Layer9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step computation earlier, I computed up to Layer9=9841, but according to the formula, Layer9=29524. So, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let's recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...) inside the outer 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, the first layer is 1 + 3(...), which is the innermost.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the 9th layer: 1 + 3*(...8 layers...).\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers inside the outer 3(...). Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is the result of the 9th layer.\n\nTherefore, according to the closed-form formula, Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step computation, I only went up to Layer9=9841, which is incorrect because that was only 8 layers, not 9.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in my initial computation:\n\n1. 9th layer: 1 + 3 =4\n\n2. 8th layer: 1 +3*4=13\n\n3.7th:1+3*13=40\n\n4.6th:1+3*40=121\n\n5.5th:1+3*121=364\n\n6.4th:1+3*364=1093\n\n7.3rd:1+3*1093=3280\n\n8.2nd:1+3*3280=9841\n\n9.1st:1+3*9841=29524\n\nWait, no, in my initial computation, I labeled the innermost as 9th layer, then moving outward as 8th, etc., up to the outermost as 1st layer. But in the closed-form formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nTherefore, in my initial computation, I computed up to the outermost layer, which is a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I stopped at a_9=9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523, which was incorrect because I miscounted the layers.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute up to a_9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial computation, I had:\n\n1. 9th layer: 4\n\n2.8th:13\n\n3.7th:40\n\n4.6th:121\n\n5.5th:364\n\n6.4th:1093\n\n7.3rd:3280\n\n8.2nd:9841\n\n9.1st:29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial computation, I only went up to 9841, which is the 2nd layer, and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. That was incorrect because I stopped too early.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this again to be sure.\n\nUsing the closed-form formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nFor n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it step by step correctly:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer1:1+3=4\n\n2. Layer2:1+3*4=13\n\n3. Layer3:1+3*13=40\n\n4. Layer4:1+3*40=121\n\n5. Layer5:1+3*121=364\n\n6. Layer6:1+3*364=1093\n\n7. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, my initial mistake was stopping at Layer8=9841 and multiplying by 3, but actually, I needed to go one more layer out to Layer9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I labeled the innermost as 9th layer, then moving outward as 8th, etc., up to the outermost as 1st layer. But in the closed-form formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer starting from the innermost as a_1. So, in the problem, we have 9 layers inside the outer 3(...), so the outermost expression is 3*(a_9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute it step by step again, making sure I go through all 9 layers.\n\n1. **Layer1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Layer2:** 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\n3. **Layer3:**1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\n4. **Layer4:**1 + 3*40=1 +120=121\n\n5. **Layer5:**1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\n6. **Layer6:**1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\n7. **Layer7:**1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\n8. **Layer8:**1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\n9. **Layer9:**1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nNow, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid now. I initially made a mistake by miscounting the layers, but upon realizing that, I corrected it and confirmed using both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution and confirm the result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost result by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me number the layers from the inside out to keep track. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)  \nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2  \nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3)  \nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4  \n... and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: (1 + 3). Then Layer 8 would be 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 7 would be 1 + Layer 8, etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.\n\nLet me write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost:  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 8 is 3*(Layer 9). So:\n\nLayer 8: 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen Layer 7 is 1 + Layer 8:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 6: 3*(13) = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(40) = 120\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 2: 3*(121) = 363\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, but then Layer 1 is the outermost part, so the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). But hold on, that might not be correct because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again, more carefully. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). Each time, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's list each layer properly.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 3*L1 = 3*4 = 12\n\nL3: 1 + L2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL4: 3*L3 = 3*13 = 39\n\nL5: 1 + L4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL6: 3*L5 = 3*40 = 120\n\nL7: 1 + L6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL8: 3*L7 = 3*121 = 363\n\nL9: 1 + L8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2: 3*4 = 12. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL4: 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL6: 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL8: 3*121 = 363. Let me check that: 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nThen the outermost expression is 3*364. Let's compute that:\n\n364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So the total is 1092.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count how many times I applied the operations.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), that's one layer. Then each time I go out one layer, so with each step, I'm moving outward. Since the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...), so I think I have nine layers, each computed correctly.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of opening parentheses to be sure. Let me look at the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sequences:\n\nStarting from the first one after 3(, then each subsequent one. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, actually, each time I see a \"3(\", that's a new layer. Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... So, the first 3( is the outermost, and each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" terms. Starting from the first 3(, then each inner 3( is a new layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, that's the outermost. Then each inner 3( is a new layer. Let me count how many times I see \"3(\" after the initial one:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, that's nine \"3(\" instances, but actually, the innermost one is just (1 + 3), without another 3( after it. So, the number of layers is eight, perhaps? Because each \"3(\" introduces a new layer, but the innermost is just (1 + 3). Let me try to count the number of times \"3(\" appears, excluding the outermost one.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis must have a closing one, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to an opening one. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which has one closing parenthesis. Then each layer adds another closing parenthesis. So, let's count:\n\nAfter the innermost (1 + 3), each time we go out, we close a parenthesis. So, the number of closing parentheses is nine, which would mean nine layers. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the expression as a sequence of operations, each time building up from the inside. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: The next layer is 3*(result from Step 1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nStep 3: The next layer is 1 + (result from Step 2) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 4: Next layer is 3*(result from Step 3) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nStep 5: Next layer is 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 6: Next layer is 3*40 = 120.\n\nStep 7: Next layer is 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 8: Next layer is 3*121 = 363.\n\nStep 9: Next layer is 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 10: Finally, the outermost expression is 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but that seems like 10 steps, but the original expression only has nine layers. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting the steps. Let me see: Each time I go from the innermost to the outermost, I'm moving through each layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 364.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, each computed step by step. So, the final answer is 1092.\n\nLet me double-check each step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 = 12. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*121 = 363. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nOutermost: 3*364 = 1092. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 1092.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without manually stepping through each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*Layer(n+1). So, starting from Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nWait, but that's not matching my previous calculation. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, in my earlier calculation, Layer 9 was 364, but according to this, Layer 5 would be 364. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the layer numbering.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost layer, and a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but that's not matching my previous result. I must have made a mistake here because earlier I had a different outcome. Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 12\n\nLayer 3: 13\n\nLayer 4: 39\n\nLayer 5: 40\n\nLayer 6: 120\n\nLayer 7: 121\n\nLayer 8: 363\n\nLayer 9: 364\n\nThen 3*364 = 1092.\n\nBut in the recurrence approach, I'm getting different numbers. I think I'm confusing the direction of the layers. Maybe I should index the layers from the outside in instead of the inside out.\n\nWait, perhaps if I define a_n as the nth layer starting from the outermost, then a_1 would be the outermost, and a_9 the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nSo, a_1 = 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the innermost is a_9.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*next_layer, except for the innermost layer, which is just 1 + 3.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, that would be:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That's way larger than my initial calculation of 1092. So, clearly, I'm making a mistake in how I'm defining the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me go back to the original expression and count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer, so let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, that's nine \"3(\" after the initial one, but the innermost is just (1 + 3), so perhaps there are nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, when I compute each layer, I should have nine layers, each computed as 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 12\n\nLayer 3: 13\n\nLayer 4: 39\n\nLayer 5: 40\n\nLayer 6: 120\n\nLayer 7: 121\n\nLayer 8: 363\n\nLayer 9: 364\n\nThen 3*364 = 1092.\n\nBut according to the recurrence approach, if I have nine layers, starting from the innermost, each layer being 1 + 3*previous_layer, then:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut that's conflicting with my initial calculation. So, I must be making a mistake in how I'm interpreting the layers. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the order of operations. Let me parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen moving outward, each layer is 3*(previous result). Wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer).\n\nWait, let's parse it step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my initial calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is 1092.\n\nI think the confusion came from how I was defining the layers. By carefully starting from the innermost and working outward, each time computing the current layer based on the previous one, I arrived at 1092. So, I'm confident that 1092 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 13 = 39\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 40 = 120\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 121 = 363\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 364 = 1092\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1092}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and then each layer wraps around that. Let me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. So, starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, we have: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Alright, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving out another layer: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Hmm, 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next layer: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let's see, 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Continuing outward: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Next layer: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Moving out another layer: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next layer: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just go through the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the layers check out. So, I think I did this correctly. It's a bit tedious with all those layers, but as long as I took it step by step, I should be okay. Another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have directly used the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for n=9. That would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since I only had to compute up to n=9, it wasn't too bad either way. Now, after computing a_9 = 29524, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that to see if it matches 88572.\n\n3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that matches. So, another way to compute the entire expression is to recognize that it's equal to (3^{11} -3)/2. That's a much quicker way if you can spot the pattern. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step, and verified with the formula, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Computed each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. After computing all layers up to the ninth, multiplied the result by 3.\n\n4. Then, to verify, I derived a general formula for each layer using recurrence relations, confirmed it with the step-by-step results, and used it to compute the final answer in a different way.\n\n5. Both methods led to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different methods gave the same result, so I'm pretty sure I did this right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{...})\\). To solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer can be computed using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\), starting with \\(a_1 = 4\\). \n\nBy computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layers evaluate to 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and 29524 respectively. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\nAdditionally, recognizing the pattern allows us to use the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\) for each layer, confirming the result when applied to the ninth layer and multiplied by 3.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer wraps another 3 times that result plus 1. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside and moving out. Let me try that approach.\n\nAlright, let's start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That should be straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, so it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's compute that. The previous result was 4, so 3*4 is 12. Then, adding 1 gives us 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. So, this layer simplifies to 40.\n\nLet me keep track of each step to avoid confusion. I'll write down each layer as I compute it.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify that because I think I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me recount to make sure I have the right number of steps.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the innermost is step 1, and the outermost is step 9, which gives us 29,524. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the very beginning. So, after computing the innermost parentheses and working outward, the final result inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Then, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29,524.\n\nCalculating that, 3 * 29,524. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = ?\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n--------\n\n88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that I correctly identified how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... So, the first opening parenthesis is after the first 3, then each subsequent opening parenthesis is after each 3.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first one after the initial 3: that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur?\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after a closing parenthesis, except for the very end. Let me try to count:\n\nAfter the first 3(1 + 3(, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1 + 3(, that's layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is layer 9, right? Because the innermost is just 1 + 3, without another parenthesis. So, the layers are 9 in total.\n\nTherefore, when I computed up to 29,524, that was the result of the innermost parentheses working outwards, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, there are nine layers, then when I compute the innermost parentheses, each step adds another layer, so after nine layers, I get 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nBut let me test this with a smaller version to see if my approach is correct. Maybe if I take a smaller version of the problem, say, with just two layers, I can compute it manually and see if my method works.\n\nLet's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). According to my method:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWhich is correct. So, my method works for two layers.\n\nLet me try three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*40) = 3*41 = 123. Wait, that's different.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) is:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n\nBut if I compute it directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my method works for three layers as well. So, perhaps my approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, with nine layers, the final result after computing all layers is 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more to ensure I haven't made any calculation errors in the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Each step seems accurate.\n\nNow, multiplying 29,524 by 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me think again. I just want to make sure that I didn't miscount the layers or make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say, C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2*C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to ensure I didn't make any mistake in the formula, let me test it with n=1,2,3.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the first few layers, so it's reliable.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number, starting from the innermost. The recurrence relation for each layer is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing all layers, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this structure. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me label each layer to keep track:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9)  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)  \nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \nAnd the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). Wait, actually, looking back, the outermost expression is 3*(...), which is Layer 1 as I labeled it. Hmm, maybe my labeling is a bit off. Let me adjust. Let me consider the innermost part as Layer 1, and each layer wraps around the previous one. So:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n...  \nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \nAnd the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Wait, let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3  \n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)  \n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))  \n...  \nContinuing this way until we have 9 layers. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, down to Layer 1: 1 + 3. So, there are 9 layers, each building on the previous one. So, I think the way to approach this is to compute each layer starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:  \nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, 3 * 29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3 * 524 = 1572\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 29524 * 3. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524  \n*        3  \n________  \nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7  \n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8  \nSo, writing it together: 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the computation of Layer 9 because 3*9841 is 29523, right? So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly because if I messed up one layer, the subsequent ones will be wrong. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer step by step? Because computing 9 layers manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Maybe I can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a general formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write down the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1  \n-2C = 1  \nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)  \n4 = 3A - 1/2  \n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, we can write:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=(177144)/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, we get the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. Each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this nested expression. To tackle this, I think I should start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me label each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9 for clarity. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). We know Layer 1 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so it's 1 + 3*40. Let's see: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so this becomes 1 + 3*121. Calculating: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so it's 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, and adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so this is 1 + 3*1093. Calculating: 3*1093 is 3279, and adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so it's 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute: 3*3280 is 9840, and adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so this becomes 1 + 3*9841. Calculating that: 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, we take 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, actually, that's not the correct breakdown because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. But wait, 29524 is actually 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, right? So, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, and 3*24 is 72. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Maybe I can do it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to slip up.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, I think my answer is correct.\n\nI remember that sometimes these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar, but in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's more of a recursive computation. Each layer depends on the previous one, so working from the inside out is the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write a general formula for such expressions, maybe I could find a pattern or a formula that gives the nth layer's value directly. Let me think about that for a moment.\n\nSuppose I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, from the problem, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and then a particular solution is added.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly for each layer. So, that's a good way to verify the result. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the general formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that my answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2.

    "text": " So, each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression or find a pattern that emerges as I compute each layer. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, ..., up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost. So, Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1). Let's compute that: Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each level is 1 plus 3 times the previous level. Let me write this down systematically:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check these calculations because they seem to be growing quite rapidly, and I want to make sure I haven't made a mistake in any step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each level is indeed calculated correctly. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9. So, the final computation would be 3*(29524) = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. But let me verify that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the Level 9 calculation. So, Level 9 is 1 + 3*(Level 8). Level 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can find a formula for this kind of expression instead of computing each level step by step. I remember that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if I denote L_n as the value at level n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computations to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me see if I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, the expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nSimplify that: (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, the expression becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, and it still gives me 88572. That reassures me that my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the original expression as a geometric series, but since it's nested, the formula approach seems more straightforward.\n\nIn summary, by computing each level step by step, I arrived at the value 29524 for the innermost expression, multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula also led me to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which confirms the result. Multiplying the final layer by 3 yields the answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, it's like a chain of these 1 + 3(...) expressions, each nested inside the other. Since they're all similar, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try to number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. Let's say the innermost one is layer 1, then the next one is layer 2, and so on, up to layer 9. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 (no parentheses after that, since it's the innermost) layer 2: 1 + 3(layer1) layer3: 1 + 3(layer2) and so on until layer9, which is the outermost. Wait, actually, the expression starts with 3 times (layer9). Hmm, maybe I should count the layers as starting from the innermost, which is layer1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me try to write each layer step by step. Starting with layer1: 1 + 3. That's easy. 1 + 3 is 4. So, layer1 = 4. Then, layer2 would be 1 + 3(layer1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, layer2 = 13. Next, layer3: 1 + 3(layer2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, layer3 = 40. Moving on to layer4: 1 + 3(layer3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer4 = 121. Layer5: 1 + 3(layer4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer5 = 364. Layer6: 1 + 3(layer5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer6 = 1093. Layer7: 1 + 3(layer6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer7 = 3280. Layer8: 1 + 3(layer7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer8 = 9841. Layer9: 1 + 3(layer8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times layer9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from layer1 up to layer9: layer1=4, layer2=13, layer3=40, layer4=121, layer5=364, layer6=1093, layer7=3280, layer8=9841, layer9=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify one or two layers to ensure I didn't miscalculate. Let's check layer3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer6: 1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000=87000; 87000 + 1500=88500; 88500 + 60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the answer. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped me manage it.

    "text": " So, there are nine layers here. Maybe I can compute each layer starting from the innermost one. Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let me denote each inner expression as follows: Let\u2019s define E_n as the expression starting from the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, we have E_9 = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, E_8 = 1 + 3(E_9), E_7 = 1 + 3(E_8), and so on, up to E_1 = 1 + 3(E_2), and finally, the entire expression is 3(E_1). So, if I compute E_9 first, then use that to compute E_8, and so on, I can work my way outwards. Let me try that. Starting with E_9: E_9 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving to E_8: E_8 = 1 + 3(E_9) = 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so E_8 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, E_7: E_7 = 1 + 3(E_8) = 1 + 3(13). 3*13 is 39, so E_7 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here, but let me not jump to conclusions yet. Let's keep going. E_6: E_6 = 1 + 3(E_7) = 1 + 3(40). 3*40 is 120, so E_6 = 1 + 120 = 121. E_5: E_5 = 1 + 3(E_6) = 1 + 3(121). 3*121 is 363, so E_5 = 1 + 363 = 364. E_4: E_4 = 1 + 3(E_5) = 1 + 3(364). 3*364 is 1092, so E_4 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E_3: E_3 = 1 + 3(E_4) = 1 + 3(1093). 3*1093 is 3279, so E_3 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E_2: E_2 = 1 + 3(E_3) = 1 + 3(3280). 3*3280 is 9840, so E_2 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, E_1: E_1 = 1 + 3(E_2) = 1 + 3(9841). 3*9841 is 29523, so E_1 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3(E_1), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Since Layer 1 is 4, then:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nLet me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nNow, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, add 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nLet me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093. Let me break it down: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let me see: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, let's compute that.\n\n3 * 29524\n\nI can compute this step by step. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. Sometimes, when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up.\n\nLet me recheck each layer quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should write it out digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I didn't skip any steps, and I double-checked each layer's computation. It seems consistent throughout. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each nested expression as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3(\\text{Layer 1})\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3(\\text{Layer 2})\\)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3(\\text{Layer 8})\\)\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
