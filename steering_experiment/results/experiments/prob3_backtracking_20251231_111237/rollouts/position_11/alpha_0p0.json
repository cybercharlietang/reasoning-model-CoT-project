    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses first. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3) which is 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, the next expression is 1 + 12, which equals 13. Wait, let me make sure I'm following correctly. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing all nine layers, the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the result of the ninth layer. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break this down to make it easier. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me recap to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3 multiplied by 29524: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next expression. Let me start by evaluating the innermost part first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. So, starting from the innermost: Let me assign each level a number to keep track. Let's say level 1 is the innermost: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) and so on, up to Level 9. So, if I can compute each level step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Got that. Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Level 2 result is 13. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Level 3 result is 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4 result is 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5 result is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6 result is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7 result is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8 result is 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Level 9 result is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9 result, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...), where ... is the Level 9 expression. So, we have 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Level 1 to Level 9, each step seems to be correct, but let me verify a couple of them. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's it. It was a bit tedious with so many levels, but breaking it down step by step helped me manage each part without getting overwhelmed. I just had to remember to compute each level one by one, starting from the innermost, and then work my way outwards. It's like peeling an onion; each layer reveals the next one until you reach the outermost layer. So, yeah, patience and careful calculation are key here. I don't see any mistakes in my steps, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this 1 + 3(...) structure. That means I'll need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one, which is the ninth layer, and work my way outwards to the first layer. Let me try to approach this step by step. Maybe I can start by labeling each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9, with Layer 1 being the innermost. Wait, actually, in the expression, the innermost part is the last one, so maybe it's better to label them from the inside as Layer 1 to Layer 9, moving outward. Let me try that. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). And so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems manageable. So, let's compute each layer one by one, starting from Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... Let me compute that. 9841 * 3. Let's break it down: 9000*3 = 27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29,523, which is 29,524. So, Layer 9 = 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524. Let's compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29,523=29,524, correct. Then the final step: 3*29,524=88,572. Let me verify 29,524*3 once more. 29,524*3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500. 88,500 + 60 is 88,560. 88,560 + 12 is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of nesting. That means I'll have to compute the innermost one first and then work my way outwards. Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's call the innermost part Layer 1, then the next one Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (that's the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the plan is to compute Layer 1, then Layer 2 using Layer 1's result, and keep going until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply that by 3. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3.

Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next digit: 9*3=27, write down 27. So putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that matches.

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute the innermost one first and then work my way outwards. Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). So, let's compute that first. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Wait, no, actually, each level is 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, perhaps I should work from the inside out, computing each level step by step. Let me try to structure this. Let's denote each level as follows: Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*(result from Level 2) And so on, until Level 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, maybe I can compute each level sequentially. Let me try that. Starting with Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Got that. Now, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Level 2: 13. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Level 3: 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4: 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5: 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6: 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7: 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8: 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Level 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, no, maybe it's easier to compute 29524*3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step because that's a lot of computation, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each level again to make sure.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Level 9 again because sometimes when you're dealing with so many levels, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the levels to ensure I didn't skip any or compute the wrong level.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Level 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Level 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Level 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Level 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Level 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Level 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Level 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Level 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Level 9)\n\nYes, that's nine levels, so Level 9 is correct. Then, the final computation is 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each level manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x, applied nine times, and then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me consider the general form.\n\nIf I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each level from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level follows the form 1 + 3*(previous level). Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I should start evaluating from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me label each part to keep track. Let's denote the innermost expression as A\u2081, then the next one as A\u2082, and so on, up to A\u2089, which would be the outermost expression. Wait, actually, since each expression is 1 + 3*(next expression), maybe I can define it recursively. Let me try that. Let me define A\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081. A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082, and so on, up to A\u2089, and then the entire expression is 3*A\u2089. Hmm, that might work. Let me try to compute each A step by step. So, starting with A\u2081: A\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving to A\u2082: A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, A\u2082 = 13. Next, A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. A\u2083 = 40. Now, A\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. A\u2084 = 121. Moving on to A\u2085: A\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, A\u2085 = 364. Next, A\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, A\u2086 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, A\u2086 = 1093. Now, A\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, A\u2087 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. A\u2087 = 3280. Moving on to A\u2088: A\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, A\u2088 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. A\u2088 = 9841. Finally, A\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, A\u2089 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, A\u2089 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089, so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost A\u2081: 1 + 3 = 4. Then A\u2082: 1 + 3*4 = 13. A\u2083: 1 + 3*13 = 40. A\u2084: 1 + 3*40 = 121. A\u2085: 1 + 3*121 = 364. A\u2086: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. A\u2087: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. A\u2088: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. A\u2089: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " So, each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, and then using that result in the next layer. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, I can compute each layer step by step. Let's try that. Let me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because the innermost expression is 1 + 3, without any other parentheses. So, let me correct that. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, the final step: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but nested. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, each term is defined recursively. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using the method for solving nonhomogeneous linear recursions. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, because (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 is equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, yes, that's another way to write it. So, for layer 9, which is the innermost part, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to go through each layer step by step. That's a good check. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Which is (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step, using the recursive formula, or using the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work in multiple ways. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outwards. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost one: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can find the value of Layer 9 and then multiply it by 3 to get the final result. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that was simple. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that because that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence relation: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula also gives the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that each layer n is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers, each time multiplying by 3. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let me think of each innermost expression as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost one: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092. Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote L_n as Layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I see a pattern here: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me recall that for such a recurrence relation, the solution is of the form L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug this into the recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the proposed solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, we need to find A. We can use the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. Therefore, 3A - 1/2 = 4. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula for L_n is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3/2) -1/2 = (27/2) -1/2 = 26/2=13, which matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4/2) -1/2 = (81/2) -1/2=80/2=40, which matches L_3=40. Okay, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3 times that expression. Let me start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple enough: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the second innermost parentheses evaluate to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me keep going to see if this pattern continues. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Wait, that's interesting. 121 is 11 squared, but maybe that's just a coincidence. Let's move on. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, not sure if that's a familiar number, but okay. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Wow, that's getting big quickly. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Wow, that's even bigger. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's see: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Hmm, 9841. I wonder if that's a perfect square or something, but maybe it's not relevant here. Let's continue. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Calculating that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Okay, moving on. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. That's another large number. Now, the next layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute that: 3*88573 is 265719, plus 1 is 265720. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*265720. Let's calculate that: 3*265720 is 797160, plus 1 is 797161. Now, that's the result inside the innermost parentheses. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, the entire expression is 3*797161. Let me compute that: 3*700000 is 2,100,000, 3*97,161 is 291,483. So, adding those together: 2,100,000 + 291,483 = 2,391,483. Wait, is that correct? Let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Next: 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*797161. Let me compute that again more carefully:\n\n797,161 * 3:\n- 700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n- 97,000 * 3 = 291,000\n- 161 * 3 = 483\n\nNow, adding those together: 2,100,000 + 291,000 = 2,391,000. Then, 2,391,000 + 483 = 2,391,483.\n\nWait a minute, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again because it's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nLet me compute 3*797,161 step by step:\n\nFirst, 700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000.\n\nThen, 90,000 * 3 = 270,000.\n\n7,000 * 3 = 21,000.\n\n100 * 3 = 300.\n\n60 * 3 = 180.\n\n1 * 3 = 3.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000.\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000.\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300.\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480.\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 2,391,483.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Each time I added 3 times the previous result to 1, I was getting larger numbers each time. Is there a smarter way to compute this without having to go through each step manually? Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nLooking at the pattern, each step seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost parentheses, and a_9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, no, hold on, earlier I had more layers. Let me recount how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count: \n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n4. 1+3(...)\n5. 1+3(...)\n6. 1+3(...)\n7. 1+3(...)\n8. 1+3(...)\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, a_1 to a_9, each defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 12 layers, but that's incorrect. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers because each opening parenthesis adds another layer. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3.\n\nThen layer 2: 1+3*(layer1).\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(layer2).\n\nContinuing up to layer9: 1+3*(layer8).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9).\n\nSo, I think I had it correct earlier when I calculated up to 797,161, which is layer9, and then multiplied by 3 to get 2,391,483.\n\nBut to make sure, let me recount the layers correctly:\n\n1. a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, this is different from my earlier calculation. Now, I'm getting a9 as 29524, but earlier I went up to 797,161. So, I think I confused the number of layers earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, that's the first.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\n...\n\nEach layer adds another 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n- The first \"1+\" after the initial 3 is layer1.\n\n- Then, each subsequent \"1+\" is another layer.\n\nCounting them:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(...)\n\n3. 1+3(...)\n\n...\n\nUp to 9 layers, because after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of \"1+\".\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is another layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the outermost layer, which is the 9th layer.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each nested within the previous one.\n\nTherefore, a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nWait, that's 88,572. But earlier, when I thought there were 12 layers, I got 2,391,483, which was incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nSo, the correct number of layers is 9, leading to a9 = 29,524, and then 3*a9 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nLet me write out the expression with the layers labeled:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, my earlier confusion was due to miscounting the number of layers, thinking there were 12 instead of 9.\n\nLet me double-check the multiplication: 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought there were 12 layers and got a much larger number, but upon recounting, it's 9 layers leading to 88,572. So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let me try computing the layers again step by step:\n\n1. a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression: 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by miscounting the layers, leading to an incorrect result. Now, after carefully recounting, I believe the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n to compute it more efficiently without having to calculate each step manually, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 =88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, using the formula, we can compute a_n directly without having to go through each step manually, which is helpful.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is a nested recurrence relation where each term is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula and compute the result step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with the innermost term \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n   The general solution for the recurrence is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the 9th Layer:**\n   For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me start there. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost part. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going. The next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). So, 3*40 = 120, and 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's a jump. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute that: 3*121 = 363, and 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, now the next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Calculating that: 3*364 = 1,092, then 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wow, that's almost 1,000. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1,093). Let's see, 3*1,093 is... 3*1,000 is 3,000, and 3*93 is 279, so 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Okay, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3,280). Let me compute 3*3,280. 3*3,000 is 9,000, and 3*280 is 840, so 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Wow, that's almost 10,000. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9,841). Let me calculate 3*9,841. 3*9,000 is 27,000, 3*800 is 2,400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Okay, so the next layer is 1 + 3*(29,524). Let me compute 3*29,524. 3*20,000 is 60,000; 3*9,000 is 27,000; 3*500 is 1,500; 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Then, 1 + 88,572 = 88,573. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(88,573). Let me compute 3*88,573. Hmm, 3*80,000 is 240,000; 3*8,000 is 24,000; 3*500 is 1,500; 3*73 is 219. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 219 = 265,719. Then, 1 + 265,719 = 265,720. So, the result of the innermost expression all the way out to the outermost parentheses is 265,720. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times that result. So, I need to compute 3*265,720. Let me calculate that. 3*200,000 is 600,000; 3*60,000 is 180,000; 3*5,000 is 15,000; 3*700 is 2,100; 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100; 797,100 + 60 = 797,160. So, 3*265,720 = 797,160. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 797,160. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent step was 1 + 3*(previous result). I calculated each step as follows: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1,093, 3,280, 9,841, 29,524, 88,573, and finally 265,720. Then, multiplying that by 3 gave me 797,160. That seems consistent. I don't see any errors in my multiplication or addition steps. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I did that correctly. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from Layer 1 as 4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the innermost Layer 1 gives 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 24*3 is 72, carry over 7. 52*3 is 156, plus 7 is 163, carry over 16. 9*3 is 27, plus 16 is 43, carry over 4. 5*3 is 15, plus 4 is 19, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering how many layers there are, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it might add up quickly. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make an error somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. Okay, so I think that's accurate. Each step seems to check out, so the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's better to solve it step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard method is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, so the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, but using the formula is much more efficient, especially if there were more layers. So, in summary, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I can compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which would be time-consuming and prone to errors. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence relation, we find that \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer, which is the ninth layer, we calculate \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " So, it's like a chain of nine expressions, each multiplied by 3. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let's start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nMoving on to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so it's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 121*3 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, let me verify each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me check 29524*3 again:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. If there were more layers, a formula might be more efficient, but here, step-by-step computation is feasible.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a recurrence relation, and solving it would give a closed-form expression. Let me try that approach to verify.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me set b_n = a_n + c, then:\n\nb_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + 3c\n\nBut since a_{n-1} = b_{n-1} - c, substituting:\n\nb_n = 1 + 3*(b_{n-1} - c) + 3c = 1 + 3*b_{n-1} - 3c + 3c = 1 + 3*b_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence for b_n is b_n = 3*b_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, that's similar to the original. Maybe another approach. Let's solve the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2*C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9 computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the previous result.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. I'll number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9. Wait, actually, let me check: Each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's a layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). And so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Let's see: The first layer is 1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another. So, from the innermost, that's Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Continuing up to Layer 9. So, there are 9 layers in total. Therefore, I'll need to compute from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time substituting the inner layer's value into the outer one. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let's compute that: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 841*3. Let's compute 800*3=2400, 41*3=123, so 2400 + 123 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000 * 3 = 60000. 9000 * 3 = 27000. 500 * 3 = 1500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step was computed correctly, right? Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each layer individually is manageable. I don't recall a specific formula for such a nested expression, but perhaps recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar? Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way to see if I get the same result, which might be a good way to verify my answer. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^10=59049. Then, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. Therefore, my answer seems consistent. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric progression. The expression is built recursively, and each time you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since each term depends on the previous one, it's a bit different. However, using the recurrence relation approach helped me confirm the result. So, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step and then using a recurrence relation to verify, I arrived at the same result both ways. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by a similar expression. To make this manageable, I think I'll compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, we have: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, so far so good. Let's go to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, going back to the original expression, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it differently to verify. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9, and finally Layer 10, which is the outermost multiplication by 3. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3( ) Wait, but in the innermost part, it's just 1 + 3(...), but actually, looking back, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because the very last parenthesis is (1 + 3). Wait, no, let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3 times (1 + ...). Wait, actually, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost), and so on. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step. Let me start by computing the innermost part first, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer will be 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer). So, let's define each layer as follows: Let me define L1 as the innermost expression: L1 = 1 + 3 Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 And so on, up to L9, and then the final result is 3*L9. Okay, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple. Now, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, moving on. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the outermost layer is 3*L9, so the final result is 3*29524 = 88572 Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from L1: 1+3=4, correct. L2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. L3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. L4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. L5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. L6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible and straightforward. Another way to approach this might be to recognize the pattern as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can see that each term is defined based on the previous one. Computing up to a_9, which we did, gives us 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Alternatively, we might try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see if that's possible. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that the result is correct.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps another 1 + 3 around it. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me clarify that. If I denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost, then each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, L2 is 13. Now, moving to the next layer out, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, L3 is 40. Continuing this way, L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, L4 is 121. Next, L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, L5 is 364. Moving on, L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. So, L6 is 1093. Next layer, L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, L7 is 3280. Then, L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, L8 is 9841. Now, the next layer, L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, L9 is 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is... wait, let me do it more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The general form is a nested expression where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). If I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. But since each layer is similar, perhaps it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to model this. Let's say that each layer L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, I can write it as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, each layer L_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula derived using the recurrence relation also gives the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Finally, Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Right. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Yep. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. That's correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Right. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. That's correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but each step checks out. I don't see any calculation errors in my steps, so I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the second layer from the inside is 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the third layer is 40. I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, I take the previous result, multiply it by 3, and then add 1. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524\n\nWait a second, did I count correctly? Let me check. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I have nine layers to compute before multiplying by the outermost 3. Hmm, in my previous steps, I went up to the 10th step, which might be incorrect. Let me recount.\n\nLooking back, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(result). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(1 + 3(...) 2. 3(1 + 3(...) 3. 3(1 + 3(...) 4. 3(1 + 3(...) 5. 3(1 + 3(...) 6. 3(1 + 3(...) 7. 3(1 + 3(...) 8. 3(1 + 3(...) 9. 3(1 + 3(...))))) So, there are nine layers inside the outermost 3. Therefore, I need to compute nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from the innermost. So, let me correct my earlier steps.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing all nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down, 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\nFinally, 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572? Let me check with another method. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting again, the innermost layer is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is correctly computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^{n} + D.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. The first layer is a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me verify the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also works.\n\nSo, all my computations check out. I think I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

The entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3), and then each layer wraps around that. Maybe if I start solving from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll be manageable. Let me try that. So, starting from the innermost part: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) Now, the next layer out is (1 + 3(4)). Let's compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))))) Next, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(13)). Let me calculate that: 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))) Continuing outward, the next part is (1 + 3(40)). 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, substituting that, we have: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))) Next layer: (1 + 3(121)). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))) Next part: (1 + 3(364)). 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, now we have: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))) Next layer: (1 + 3(1093)). 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, substituting, we get: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280))) Next part: (1 + 3(3280)). 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(9841)) Now, moving one layer out: (1 + 3(9841)). 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, substituting, we have: 3(29524) Finally, the outermost layer: 3 times 29524. Let me compute that. 3 times 29524: 29524 times 3. Let's do this step by step. 29524 x 3: 4 x 3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 x 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5 x 3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 x 3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 x 3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, 29524 x 3 is 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 x 3: 4 x 3 is 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. 2 x 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7. 5 x 3 is 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9 x 3 is 27 plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2 x 3 is 6 plus 2 is 8. So yes, 88572. So, 3 times 29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any errors in my calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems correct. Let me just verify a couple of the intermediate steps again to be thorough. For example, step 6: (1 + 3*364). 364*3 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Step 8: (1 + 3*3280). 3280*3 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. And step 10: 29524*3 is 88572. Correct. So, I think I did this correctly. I didn't skip any steps, and each time I just calculated the innermost parentheses first and worked my way out. It's a bit tedious, but since each layer only depends on the previous one, this method works well. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, 3 times Layer 1 is 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let's compute 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. I can cross-check a few layers to ensure that each step is correct. For example, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572, correct. So, each step checks out. I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is calculated until Layer 9 is reached.

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each level one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's denote the innermost part as follows: Let me start from the very inside and work my way out. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving one level out, it's 1 + 3 times that result, and so on. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result as I go. Let me define each layer as a step. Let's say:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3)\nStep 2: Use that result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1)\nStep 3: Use Step 2's result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2)\nAnd so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nSince there are nine layers, I'll need to compute this nine times. Let me list them as Steps 1 through 9, each time computing the next layer outwards. Let me start.\n\n**Step 1:** Compute (1 + 3)\nThat's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n**Step 2:** Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 1)\nSo, 1 + 3*4. First, 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n\n**Step 3:** Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 2)\nSo, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n\n**Step 4:** Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 3)\n1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\n**Step 5:** Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 4)\n1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\n**Step 6:** Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 5)\n1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364: 364*3. Let me compute that: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n**Step 7:** Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 6)\n1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n**Step 8:** Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 7)\n1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n**Step 9:** Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 8)\n1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, I think I went one step too far because the original expression has nine layers, but each time I compute a step, I'm moving one layer out. Let me check that again. Let me count the number of times I computed:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3) as Step 1, then each subsequent step adds another layer. The original expression has nine layers, so I think I need to compute up to Step 9, but in my steps above, I went up to Step 9, which would correspond to the outermost layer. But wait, in the original problem, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, right? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original problem is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and the very outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, my Steps 1 through 9 compute the innermost expression up to the layer just inside the outermost 3*(...). So, after computing Step 9, which gives 29524, that is the result of the innermost expression up to the point where it's multiplied by 3. Therefore, the final step is to multiply that result by 3.\n\nWait, no, let me make sure. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(...). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is layer 1.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(layer1) is layer 2.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(layer2) is layer3.\n\nContinuing until layer9.\n\nSo, after computing layer9, which is 29524, that is the value inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I stopped at Step 9, which was 29524, but that was the result of 1 + 3*(previous step). So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). Therefore, after computing layer9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I computed up to Step 9 as 29524, which was 1 + 3*(layer8). So, that would be the value inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*(...). The original expression has nine instances of (1 + 3*(...)), so each step corresponds to one of those. Therefore, after Step 9, I have computed the innermost expression, which is the value inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, let me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in my earlier steps. Let me go back through each step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\n**Step 1:** 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Step 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Step 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Step 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Step 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Step 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Step 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Step 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Step 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, final step: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each step manually, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nWait, another thought: This expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model it as such. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as in Step 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWhich matches my earlier steps. So, this is indeed a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that such a recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to derive it.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + k*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, c = 1, k = 3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, it matches. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, a_9 would be:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^5=243, so 3^10=243^2=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the result from Step 9 earlier.\n\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and the final result is 3*29524=88572, as computed before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each step manually or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved time by using the formula, but since the number of layers isn't too large, step-by-step computation is feasible.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building a number in base 3, but I don't think that's necessary here since the recurrence approach works well.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into manageable steps and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, I was able to compute the result accurately. It's also good to verify each step to avoid arithmetic errors, especially with larger numbers. Using a closed-form solution is a powerful method when dealing with repetitive structures like nested expressions, as it can save time and reduce the chance of errors.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing this as a linear recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form formula. Here's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Step 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Step 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Step 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Step 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Step 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Step 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Step 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Step 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Step 9 (Innermost Layer):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, maybe I should start by solving the innermost one and then work my way out. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, and so on, starting from the innermost. So, L1 would be the very last (1 + 3), right? Let me check: Starting from the inside, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...) on the outside. So, let's start with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, L3 would be 1 + 3*(L2). Plugging in L2 as 13, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me write down each step as I go along to keep track. So, let's list them out:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so does that mean after computing L9, which is the outermost layer, I still have to multiply it by 3? Let me double-check the original problem. It says: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, yes, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3*(L9). But wait, in my earlier breakdown, I considered L9 as the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), which would actually be the part inside the first 3(...). So, perhaps I should adjust my notation. Let me clarify:\n\nLet me denote each level as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, the innermost is 4, then each subsequent level is 1 + 3*previous. So, after computing all nine layers, the innermost becomes 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, the total would be 88,572. But wait, did I make a mistake here? Let me check again because 29524*3: 29524*3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nLet's multiply each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I computed up to L9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost 3(...). So, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me recount the layers to be sure. Let's see: The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is the innermost, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the number of layers is nine, as each (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as layer 1, up to layer 9, which is the outermost before the initial 3. Therefore, after computing layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Let me think about it. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the problem is asking for 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, as before, a_9 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n in such a recurrence relation. Let's explore that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form, we can write the total expression as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, especially with the exponents and multiplications.\n\n- Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n- Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous, computed up to the ninth layer, giving 29524.\n\n- Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nTotal expression = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that all adds up.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost layer outward and applying the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a closed-form formula. Calculating step by step or using the formula both lead to the same result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times the result of the outermost layer (Layer 9).\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Each layer depends on the previous one, so I can compute each step by step. Let me start computing each layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524. Let me verify that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88,572. I think that makes sense because each layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, which is similar to a geometric series but nested. It's interesting how the numbers grow exponentially as we move outward. I wonder if there's a formula for such nested expressions, but since I already computed each layer, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next.

So, Layer 9 result is 29524, so the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. So, putting it all together: 27, 8, 7, 7, 12. Wait, that seems off. Maybe I should just do it more carefully. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the numbers from top to bottom: 8, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be more than 29000 \u00d7 3 = 87000, so 88572. Let me check again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, this might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure: Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in our case, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, which is 4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that.\n\nWait, for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but in our case, a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, it's more efficient, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine, computing each step manually is also feasible.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Ultimately, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer becomes 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me write this down step by step to keep track. Let me number each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9. Wait, actually, since there are nine sets of parentheses, maybe I should count them. Let me check: starting from the innermost, each time I have a (1 + 3(...)), so the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)). Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)), and so on, up to Layer 9. So, perhaps I should compute each Layer from 1 to 9 and then multiply the final result by 3 at the end. Let me try that approach. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Layer2 = 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer3 = 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer4 = 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer5 = 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer6 = 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer7 = 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer8 = 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer9 = 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, after computing Layer9, which is the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me verify my calculations because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might make an error. Let me recheck each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72.\n\nAdding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I can compute it another way to cross-verify. Let me compute Layer9 again just to be sure. Layer8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 digit by digit.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression is 3*a_9.\n\nI wonder if there's a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which confirms the result after computing each layer manually. The final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost one, which is 1 + 3, and then working my way out. Let me number the parentheses from the inside out to keep track. Let's say the innermost is Parentheses 1: (1 + 3) Then Parentheses 2: (1 + 3(...)) where the ... would be Parentheses 1. Similarly, Parentheses 3 would depend on Parentheses 2, and so on, up to Parentheses 9, which is the outermost one. So, if I can compute each Parentheses from 1 to 9, I can substitute each result into the next one until I reach the final answer. Let me start with Parentheses 1: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Parentheses 1 = 4. Now, moving to Parentheses 2: (1 + 3*(Parentheses 1)). Since Parentheses 1 is 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Parentheses 2 = 13. Next, Parentheses 3: (1 + 3*(Parentheses 2)). Parentheses 2 is 13, so it's (1 + 3*13). 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Parentheses 3 = 40. Moving on to Parentheses 4: (1 + 3*(Parentheses 3)). That's (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Parentheses 4 = 121. Parentheses 5: (1 + 3*(Parentheses 4)) = (1 + 3*121). Let me calculate 3*121: 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Parentheses 5 = 364. Parentheses 6: (1 + 3*(Parentheses 5)) = (1 + 3*364). 364*3: Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Parentheses 6 = 1093. Parentheses 7: (1 + 3*(Parentheses 6)) = (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Parentheses 7 = 3280. Parentheses 8: (1 + 3*(Parentheses 7)) = (1 + 3*3280). Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Parentheses 8 = 9841. Finally, Parentheses 9: (1 + 3*(Parentheses 8)) = (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Parentheses 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Parentheses 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4, correct. Then, (1+3*4)=1+12=13, correct. (1+3*13)=1+39=40, correct. (1+3*40)=1+120=121, correct. (1+3*121)=1+363=364, correct. (1+3*364)=1+1092=1093, correct. (1+3*1093)=1+3279=3280, correct. (1+3*3280)=1+9840=9841, correct. (1+3*9841)=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me verify 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I did everything step by step, starting from the inside and working my way out, making sure each step was correct before moving on. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down made it manageable. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the value inside the parentheses and substituting it into the next layer. By following this method, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I should start solving from the innermost one and work my way outwards. Let me label each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9 for easier reference. Layer 1: 1 + 3 (since it's the innermost) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2, which is 1 + 3*(result of Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(result of Layer 2). So, 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 3). That's 3*40, which is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 4). So, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, wait, no, the digits are 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, actually, let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that again because I might have messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, that's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That matches, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nThe expression can be represented as:\n\nE = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... + 3(1 + 3))...)))\n\nWith nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nYes, that's what I did before.\n\nBut perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. If I have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1).\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for such a linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - k*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a solution of a_n = C*k^n.\n\nThen, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: A = k*A + c \u21d2 A - k*A = c \u21d2 A(1 - k) = c \u21d2 A = c/(1 - k).\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*k^n + c/(1 - k).\n\nNow, applying initial conditions, say a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = C*k^1 + c/(1 - k) = C*k + c/(1 - k) = 4.\n\nIn our case, k = 3, c = 1.\n\nSo, a_n = C*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, using a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have nine layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed the pattern earlier. Each time, the inner expression is 1 + 3*(previous), which builds up exponentially, so the final result is quite large, but manageable with careful calculation.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recursive formula approach give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer, leading to a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we find the value of the innermost expression and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer.\n4. The ninth layer results in 29524.\n5. Multiply this result by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, after computing the innermost levels up to Level 9, which gives me 29524, I think I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me check: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me verify each step because it's easy to make a multiplication error with such large numbers. Let me go through each level again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Now, multiply this by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Wait, that's not correct because 29524 is actually 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me check if I correctly identified how many levels there are. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another level. Let me count: Starting from the first 3, then (1+3(...). Each time, it's another layer. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a new level. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. 1. 3(1+3(...\nOkay, I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me check again. Each time I see a \"1+3(\", that's a new level. So starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3). Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new level, starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new level, and each \")\" closes it. So, starting from the innermost, we have (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me look at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(\n2. Then another (1+3(\n3. Another (1+3(\n4. Another (1+3(\n5. Another (1+3(\n6. Another (1+3(\n7. Another (1+3(\n8. Another (1+3(\n9. Another (1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times \"1+3(\", which would mean 9 levels. But when I computed earlier, I went up to Level 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, perhaps that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me try to parse it differently. Let's write the expression with indices:\n\nLevel 1: 3(1 + 3(...))\nLevel 2: inside Level 1: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n...\nBut perhaps it's better to think of it as each \"1+3(\" adds a level, so the innermost is Level 1: (1+3)\nThen Level 2: 1+3*(Level 1)\nLevel 3: 1+3*(Level 2)\n...\nUp to Level 9: 1+3*(Level 8)\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9)\n\nSo, that would mean that after computing Level 9, I multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, in my earlier calculation, I computed Level 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if Level 9 is indeed the outermost. Let me count the number of closing parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a level. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is one level.\n- Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another level.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to the ninth level.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3), then each next layer adds another \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the string: \"3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\"\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new level. Let me count them:\n\n- The first is after the initial 3: (1+3(\n- Then another (1+3(\n- Another (1+3(\n- Another (1+3(\n- Another (1+3(\n- Another (1+3(\n- Another (1+3(\n- Another (1+3(\n- Another (1+3(\n\nSo that's 9 times \"1+3(\", which would mean 9 levels. So, Level 1 is the innermost (1+3), Level 2 is 1+3*(Level1), up to Level9, then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, in that case, my initial calculation is correct: Level9 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly computed each Level.\n\nLevel1: 1+3=4\n\nLevel2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLevel3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLevel4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLevel5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLevel6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLevel7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLevel8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLevel9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check Level7 again. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel8: 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 29524*3 again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n________\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the levels, let me try a different approach. Let's consider that each \"1+3(\" adds a level, so the total number of levels is 9, as we have 9 \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recursive formula. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of levels, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThen, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nSo, f(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The recurrence is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4.\n\nf(1) = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n=9, so f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*f(9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used a recursive approach, and even derived a closed-form formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by working from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\n1. **Innermost Level (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " So, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me try to approach this step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. Let's label each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Wait, but in the given expression, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, actually, the structure is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on. Hmm, maybe I should start by evaluating Layer 1 first and then build up each layer step by step. Let me try that. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1,092. Adding 1 gives 1,093. So, Layer 6 is 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1,093, so 3*1,093 is 3,279. Adding 1 gives 3,280. So, Layer 7 is 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3,280, so 3*3,280 is 9,840. Adding 1 gives 9,841. So, Layer 8 is 9,841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9,841, so 3*9,841 is 29,523. Adding 1 gives 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that: 29,524 * 3. Let's do this step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1,092=1,093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1,093=1+3,279=3,280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3,280=1+9,840=9,841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9,841=1+29,523=29,524, correct. Then, the final step: 3*29,524=88,572. Let me confirm 29,524*3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding all together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572.

Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant to be determined.\n\nSubstituting L_n^{(p)} into the recurrence relation:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3*C\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nOkay, so that gives me a formula for L_n. Let me verify this with the earlier layers to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n = 1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2:\n\nL_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n = 3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n = 4:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula seems to hold. So, using this formula, I can compute L_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. That would save a lot of time.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, hold on, because in our earlier definition, L_1 corresponds to n=1, which is 1 + 3, so for L_9, n=9, so the exponent is 3^{9+1} = 3^{10}.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, 3^{10} is a big number. Let me compute that.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, 3^{10} is 59049.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 30000*3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476.\n\nWait, alternatively, I can compute it directly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n________\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but wait, 29524 * 3: Let's check with another method.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdd them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, especially with the exponent. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is indeed 59049, so 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3 is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, just to double-check, I can ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the formula.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each term as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is the same recurrence relation as before. So, solving it using the method for linear recurrences is valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric progression. Let me see.\n\nIf I expand the expression, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer adds a term that is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let's try expanding it.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nExpression = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it step by step, expanding each layer:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nAs before, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nSo, expanding this, L9 can be written as:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWhich is the same as the original expression but one layer less. So, this approach circles back to the same recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to expand the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression without parentheses, it would be a sum of terms each multiplied by different powers of 3. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(...), so when expanded, each 1 is multiplied by 3 multiple times.\n\nSpecifically, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nWait, let me think about that.\n\nEach layer adds a 1 that gets multiplied by 3 for each subsequent layer. Since there are 9 layers, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, etc., and the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the expression, each 1 is part of a term that is 1 + 3*(...), so each 1 is only multiplied by 3^(number of layers - position). Let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me consider that each 1 in the expression is part of a term that is 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8 because it's nested 8 layers deep. The next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0.\n\nSo, the entire expression can be written as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) \n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))))))) \n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted. Let me instead think of the expression as a sum of 1's multiplied by different powers of 3.\n\nEach time we have a 1 + 3*(...), the 1 is contributing to the total, and the 3*(...) is contributing the rest.\n\nIf I expand the entire expression, it's equivalent to:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\n= 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) \n\nBut this seems to lead to an infinite expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, another approach: since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we have 9 layers, maybe we can express the entire expression as a sum over these layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence relation solution since that gave me a clear answer.\n\nGiven that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, after verifying through multiple approaches and ensuring that each step is correct, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows a recurrence relation. By solving the recurrence, we find that each layer can be expressed using a formula involving powers of 3. Calculating the innermost layers step by step and applying the formula, we determine the value of the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. Define each layer as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4.\n3. Solve the recurrence relation to find L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n4. Compute L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n5. Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar term). Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I start from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then Layer 1 would be 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's define each layer as follows: Let Layer 1 = 1 + 3 Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute Layer 1 first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Breaking it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that approach. I'll label each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, since each layer is inside the previous one, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me try that. So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, so Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, hold on. Looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, this seems to be growing quickly. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*524=1572. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*      3\n-------\n88572\n\nWait, 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let's think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}. Wait, but that might not be the standard way. Alternatively, since each layer is built from the next one, perhaps it's better to define it as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, but I might be getting confused. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a recurrence relation where each term is built from the previous one. Let me think again. The innermost term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving outward, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I was computing each layer step by step, it worked out. Either way, the result is the same. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with the innermost layer \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using this recurrence relation, each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\( 1 + 3(\\text{next term}) \\).\n\n2. **Start from the innermost term**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n3. **Compute each subsequent layer**:\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n4. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer**:  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, maybe I should start by solving the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try to identify the innermost parentheses. The very last part inside the expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next level out is 13. Let me note that down. Now, moving one more level out, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so that level gives me 40. Continuing this way, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, now I'm at 121. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). Let me do that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that gives me 364. Next, the expression is 1 + 3*(364). Calculating that: 3*364 is... let me think, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, now I have 1093. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that's 3280. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me calculate that: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives me 9841. So, now I'm at 9841. Moving out another layer, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute this: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is... wait, 841 is 29 squared, so 3*841 is 2523. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is... let me see, 9524*3. 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. So, adding those together: 27000 + 1500 is 28500, plus 72 is 28572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, now I have 88573. Moving out to the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that: 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Wait, but actually, 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So, 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Now, adding all those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. Next, 1+3*40=121. Then, 1+3*121=364. Then, 1+3*364=1093. Next, 1+3*1093=3280. Then, 1+3*3280=9841. After that, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 1+3*29524=88573. Finally, 3*88573=265719. Hmm, each step seems to follow logically. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations. So, I think the final answer is 265719.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " So, each time, we have 1 plus 3 times another expression. This seems recursive, almost like a fractal or something. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let's try that. Let me start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4).

Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, I'm seeing a pattern here. Let me try to write down each step systematically. Let me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 to 9. Wait, actually, in the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me check how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), and each layer adds another set. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: starting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3(...) adds another. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each of those has another (1 + 3(...)) inside. Let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting with 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. I think I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3) as Layer 1, then each time we go outwards, it's another layer. Let me see the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer 1: 4\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, let's list each layer correctly:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there are indeed 9 layers. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...) starting from the first one after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n3. And so on until the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions:\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the first (1+3(...)), each subsequent one is nested inside. So, how many times does (1+3) appear? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times I see (1+3(...)):\n\nFrom the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3(...)), each subsequent one is inside. So, let's count how many (1+3) terms there are.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see that each (1+3) is a separate layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times (1+3) appears. Let's see:\n\nEach opening ( after the first 3 starts a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the 3, the first ( is for the first (1+3(...)), then each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. (1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. (1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. (1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. (1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. (1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, the innermost is Layer 9: (1+3) =4, then Layer 8 is 1 +3*4=13, Layer7=1+3*13=40, Layer6=1+3*40=121, Layer5=1+3*121=364, Layer4=1+3*364=1093, Layer3=1+3*1093=3280, Layer2=1+3*3280=9841, Layer1=1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer1)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had Layer9 as 29524, but that seems off because each layer is built upon the previous. Wait, perhaps I mislabeled the layers. Let me clarify:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3) as Layer 1:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*(Layer1)=1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)=1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(Layer4)=1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(Layer5)=1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(Layer6)=1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(Layer7)=1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(Layer8)=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is built upon the previous, starting from the innermost, and each time, the value grows significantly.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3). Let's count the number of times (1+3) appears:\n\nEach time, we have (1+3(...)), so each (1+3) is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 Layer1\n\nThen, moving out, each (1+3( ... )) is another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, as I have from Layer1 to Layer9. So, that seems correct.\n\nLet me just recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: (1 +3)=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to see if there's a quicker way to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nWait, actually, starting from the innermost, a_1=4, then a_2=1+3*a_1=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=40, etc.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C -3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 =3A -1/2 \u2192 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only had 9 layers, manually computing each step was manageable. However, knowing the general formula is useful for future problems.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step, working outward. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4, we find each layer's value. The final value of the innermost layer is 29524, and multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and then each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3 times the previous result. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let's start by numbering the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 through 9. Wait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost: 1. 1 + 3 2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) 3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) ... and so on, until the ninth layer. So, there are nine layers in total. Hmm, that seems a bit tedious, but if I take it step by step, it should be manageable. Let me start with the innermost layer, which is layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, layer 1 result is 4. Now, moving one layer out, layer 2: 1 + 3*(result of layer 1). Since layer 1 was 4, layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, layer 2 result is 13. Next, layer 3: 1 + 3*(result of layer 2). Layer 2 was 13, so 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, layer 3 result is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(result of layer 3). Layer 3 was 40, so 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 result: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(result of layer 4). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 result: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is... let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 result: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 result: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 result: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 result: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times the result of layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify each step because that seems like a lot of multiplication. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841.

So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer was computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end was double-checked. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me label each layer to keep track. Let's call the innermost expression Layer 1, then the next one Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8), and finally, the entire expression is 3(Layer 9). So, I can compute Layer 1, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me check if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, that's 121. Let me see if I can find a pattern or maybe a formula for each layer. Each layer seems to be following the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1)). So, each time, we're multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This looks like a geometric series or maybe a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. If I denote Layer n as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form of the recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) * b, where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 is 4, not L_0. Let me adjust the indices. Let me set L_0 = 1 (the innermost term before the first multiplication by 3). Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3, which is 4. So, actually, L_1 = 4, and L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from n=1. Let me try to find a general formula. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. Wait, but 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Let me write it as:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________  \n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15.

Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^{10}-1)/2= (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.

Let me try to parse this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let's denote each layer as Layer 1, Layer 2, up to Layer 9, where Layer 1 is the innermost. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Let me write that down: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Calculating that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.

Let's calculate 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Therefore, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those up: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct. I think each step checks out, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer. \n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the solution:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is the last 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try that approach. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))) Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The innermost (1 + 3) is replaced by 4, so the next layer out is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out becomes (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time I go out a layer, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me write down each step as I compute each layer.\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, hold on. I think I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each step I take is moving out one layer. So, starting with (1 + 3) = 4, that's the first step. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous result) +1. So, let me count how many layers I have:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524\n\nWait, let's compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way. Since the expression is a repeated pattern, perhaps there's a formula or a recursive way to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost expression, and each subsequent a_n is built by the previous one. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something else, but I think the recurrence approach is solid here.\n\nWait, let me try another approach just to make sure. Maybe expanding the entire expression as a sum.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.\n\nIf I denote the innermost part as x, then each layer is 1 + 3x, and the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x), and so on.\n\nBut since I already have a formula for a_n, and I know that a_9 is 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each a_n step by step using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and see if it aligns with my earlier computations.\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so each step aligns perfectly with my earlier computations. Therefore, I can be confident that a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3=88572, which is 88572, not 88528. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, let me do it again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572, which is correct. I think I just misread it earlier. So, yes, 29524 \u00d73=88572.\n\nTherefore, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can think of this expression as a sum of a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and so on, nine times. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but it's nested, so it's more like a geometric series within a geometric series, which is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum. Let me try to see.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Wait, but that might not help directly because each layer is dependent on the next.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but I don't think that's accurate because each term is nested, not added directly. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, actually, no. Each layer is 1 + 3*next layer, so it's not a simple sum of powers of 3. It's more like each term is built by multiplying the next term by 3 and adding 1, which is exactly what the recurrence relation captures.\n\nSo, perhaps the sum approach isn't the right way here, and the recurrence relation is the better method.\n\nIn any case, since both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation approach yield the same result, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. Recognize the recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula to compute the nth term.\n\n4. Verify each step using the formula and cross-check with direct computation.\n\n5. Confirm the final result by multiple methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nI think I've covered all bases here, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous result}\\).\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
