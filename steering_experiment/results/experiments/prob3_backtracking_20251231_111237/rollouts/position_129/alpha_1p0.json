Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can check this using a different approach, maybe by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Let me see: Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be written as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to 3^9, but wait, no, because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, so when you expand it all, it's actually a sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=9, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me try expanding the innermost layers to see. Let me take a smaller version to test. Suppose I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute this manually. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, expanding the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, if I consider the expansion, it's 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4. Let's compute that: 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120. Yes, that works. So, the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) equals 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120. So, in general, for n layers, the expression would be the sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=n+1. Wait, in the small example, n=3 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120, which is 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120, which is the sum from k=1 to 4 of 3^k. So, in general, for m layers, the sum is from k=1 to k=m+1. Wait, but in the problem, there are 9 layers. Let me check: The original problem has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another exponent. So, perhaps the sum is from 3^1 up to 3^{10}, but let's see. Wait, in the small example with 3 layers, we had 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 120, which is the same as (3^{5} - 3)/2. Wait, because the sum of a geometric series from k=1 to n is (r^{n+1} - r)/ (r - 1). So, for r=3, sum from k=1 to n is (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. So, in the small example, n=3: sum = (3^4 - 3)/2 = (81 - 3)/2 = 78/2 = 39, but wait, that doesn't match 120. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Wait, in the small example, the sum was 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120, which is 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4. So, n=4 terms, which would correspond to (3^5 - 3)/2 = (243 - 3)/2 = 240/2 = 120. Yes, that works. So, in the original problem, how many terms would we have? Let's see, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each layer adds another 3 times a term. So, the total number of layers is 9, which would correspond to the sum from 3^1 up to 3^{10}, because each layer adds another exponent. Wait, let me think again. In the small example with 3 layers, we had 4 terms (3^1 to 3^4). So, if the problem has 9 layers, then the sum would be from 3^1 to 3^{10}, which is 10 terms. So, the sum S = 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^{10}. The formula for the sum is (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, S = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572. This makes sense because the nested expression effectively sums a geometric series where each term is 3 raised to an increasing power, starting from 1 up to 10. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer. I think this solidifies that the correct result is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods agree, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing it as a geometric series. Each layer adds another power of 3, leading to the sum of a geometric series from 3^1 to 3^{10}. The sum of this series is calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could compute this using the closed-form formula directly. Let me try that. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is consistent. So, I think I've arrived at the correct solution by both iterative computation and by solving the recurrence relation. It gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"
