So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, using the closed-form, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=29524, so 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, can we write the entire expression in terms of the closed-form? The entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.
