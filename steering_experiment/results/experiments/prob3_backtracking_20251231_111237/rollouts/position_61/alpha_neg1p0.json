Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time if the expression were longer. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to follow the pattern of a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the expression is only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually is manageable. However, for completeness, let's see if we can model this as a geometric series. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, but let me verify one of the layers again to ensure I didn't miscalculate. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000+2400=29400 +123=29523.

Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's a pattern here that I can recognize, maybe a geometric series or something else that could have allowed me to compute this more efficiently without expanding each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. It looks like a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, which in this case is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Next, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, this formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute this without expanding each layer, I could have used the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula give the same answer.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is 4 times the previous term minus something? Let me check: 13 = 4*3 + 1? Wait, 4*3=12, plus 1 is 13. 40 = 4*10, but 13*3=39, plus 1 is 40. 121 = 40*3=120 +1=121. 364=121*3=363 +1=364. 1093=364*3=1092 +1=1093. 3280=1093*3=3279 +1=3280. 9841=3280*3=9840 +1=9841. 29524=9841*3=29523 +1=29524. So, each layer L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. So, that's a recurrence relation. L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. That's a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). Applying this formula for the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify that with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18. Write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, that gives 88572 as well. Okay, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly because if I made a mistake in any of the layers, the final answer will be wrong. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times 1+3 starts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n4. 1+3(...)\n5. 1+3(...)\n6. 1+3(...)\n7. 1+3(...)\n8. 1+3(...)\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nSo, there are nine layers, each starting with 1+3, and then each time, the outermost one is multiplied by 3. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the one before the outermost multiplication by 3. Therefore, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, maybe. Let me see if that approach works. The expression seems to be a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1 each time. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, so this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: D = 1 + 3*D.\n\nSolving for D: D = 1 + 3D \u2192 0 = 1 + 2D \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I also arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's like:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nIf I expand this, it's 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3*3^n, but I'm not sure if that's the right way. Wait, perhaps it's better to see how many terms there are.\n\nWait, in the expansion, each layer adds another 3^n term. Let me try to write the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3*3.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3.\n\nSo, each layer adds another power of 3. So, for 9 layers, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, maybe the expansion is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Because each layer adds another 3^k term, starting from k=0 up to k=9.\n\nWait, let me think again. When I expand the expression, each time I have a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, when I multiply by 3, it's like 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the total is 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). Because the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2, and so on, up to the 9th layer, which would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which would include up to 3^9.\n\nWait, but when I compute the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would expand to 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8). Because each time you go one layer out, you add another power of 3. So, with 9 layers, the innermost is 3^1, and the outermost is 3^8.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me count the number of terms. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 2 terms. Each layer out adds another term. So, with 9 layers, the expansion would be up to 3^9 terms. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers with the exponents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Because when you have 9 layers, each adding a power of 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^8.\n\nWait, let's test this. If I have n layers, each time you go out a layer, you add another 3^{n-1} term. So, for 9 layers, the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8). The sum inside the parentheses is a geometric series with 9 terms, first term 1, ratio 3.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So, sum = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that's different from what I got earlier. Wait, this contradicts my previous result.\n\nWait, I must be making a mistake here. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I computed each layer step by step and arrived at 88572. Using the geometric series approach, I'm getting a different answer, 29523. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of terms in the geometric series. Let me re-examine.\n\nIf I expand the entire expression, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers, how many terms does that give?\n\nLet me try expanding it step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nContinuing this way, each layer adds another power of 3. So, Layer n would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7), etc., down to Layer 1.\n\nWait, so Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9\n\nWait, so Layer 9 would have 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, which is a sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, but starting from k=0, which is 1, so it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9.\n\nBut wait, no, because Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 9 would be 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^9.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside Layer 9 is sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572, which matches my initial step-by-step calculation.\n\nWait, so earlier when I thought the sum was up to 3^8, that was incorrect. It's actually up to 3^9. So, the sum is from k=0 to k=9, which gives 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the geometric series approach also confirms the initial result. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this problem as repeatedly applying the operation of multiplying by 3 and adding 1, nine times, starting from 1. So, starting with x = 1, then x = 1 + 3*x, and so on, nine times, and then multiplying the result by 3.\n\nWait, let me try that. Let me define a function f(x) = 1 + 3x. Starting with x0 = 1, then x1 = f(x0) = 1 + 3*1 = 4, x2 = f(x1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, x3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to x9. Then, the entire expression is 3*x9.\n\nLet me compute these:\n\nx0 = 1\n\nx1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\nx2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nx3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nx4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nx5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nx6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nx7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nx8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nx9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, and it also gives the same result.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried the geometric series approach, I thought I was getting a different result, but now I see that was a mistake in counting the exponents. So, all methods point to 88572 as the answer.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this from multiple angles: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, geometric series, and function iteration. All lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, I can compute the entire expression using another method, perhaps using a calculator or writing a small program to compute it step by step. But since I don't have a calculator handy, I can try to compute each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent every time.\n\nI think I've spent enough time verifying this. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5.

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let's write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations because this seems like a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute the 9th term without calculating each step. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let me try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer, which is nice. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same answer, I feel confident that 88572 is correct. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By expanding from the innermost layer outward, I found each layer's value and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to find a closed-form solution, which confirmed the result. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together, starting from the right: 2, then 7, then 5, then 8, then 8. So that's 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As computed earlier, that's 88572. So yes, that seems right. Let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up. 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So adding those together: 40000 + 18000 = 58000 + 1000 = 59000 + 40 = 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's break it down: 50000 + 20000 = 70000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 400 + 500 = 900, 40 + 20 = 60, 8 + 4 = 12. So adding up: 70000 + 18000 = 88000 + 900 = 88900 + 60 = 88960 + 12 = 88972. Wait, that's different from 88572. Hmm, so that means I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication. Wait, so which one is correct? Let me check again. 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2. So that's 88572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88972. There's a discrepancy here. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the addition when verifying. Let me try adding 29524 + 29524 again:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10\n\n9 + 9 = 18\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\nStarting from units place: 8\n\nTens place: 4\n\nHundreds place: 0 (since 5+5=10, write down 0 and carry over 1)\n\nThousands place: 8 + 1 (carry) = 9\n\nTen-thousands place: 4\n\nSo the sum is 59048.\n\nNow, adding another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524.\n\nAgain, starting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18. Write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\nUnits: 2\n\nTens: 7\n\nHundreds: 5\n\nThousands: 8\n\nTen-thousands: 8\n\nSo that's 88572. Wait, that's the same as the multiplication result. So earlier, when I added, I must have made a mistake in the intermediate steps. So the correct total is 88572. Therefore, my initial multiplication was correct. Phew, that was a bit confusing, but I think I caught the error in my addition. So, to recap, each layer is computed by taking 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost, which is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue with the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5.

Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So putting it all together, we have 87,572? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6+1=7, 5*3=15 (write 5, carry 1), 2*3=6+1=7, 9*3=27 (write 7, carry 2), 2*3=6+2=8. So the result is 87,572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me verify by adding 29524 three times. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 87,572. Hmm, I think I made a mistake in the multiplication earlier. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit carefully:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Wait, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my addition again. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, plus 9524: 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: Let's break it down: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, + 9524 = 79048 + 9524 = 88572. So, 3 times 29524 is 88,572. Hmm, so where did I go wrong in the multiplication? Let's do it step by step again:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result should be 87,572? Wait, but according to addition, it's 88,572. So I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Wait, 29524 is 29,524, right? So 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7.\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7.\n- 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo that's 87,572? Wait, but when I add 29,524 three times, I get 88,572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial layers. Maybe the Layer 9 computation was wrong, leading to an incorrect final result. Let me go back and check each layer again to see if I made a mistake there.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524, correct? Then 3 * 29524 = 88,572, as per the addition method. So perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Next digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- Next digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Next digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- Next digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Next digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 87,572. Wait, but 29,524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88,572 because 29,524 \u00d7 3 = (30,000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. So I must have miscalculated the digit positions earlier. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the correct result is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. I think earlier I misplaced the digits when writing down the multiplication, leading to confusion. So, to recap, each layer was computed correctly up to Layer 9, which is 29,524, and then multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. So, the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step because if I messed up one layer, it would throw off all the subsequent layers. Let's start again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, that should be the answer. Hmm, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold for the first few layers. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier for a_9. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can express the entire original expression using the formula. The original expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or express it in terms of exponents, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88,572. I think I've covered all the steps, checked my work using different methods, and everything lines up. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down step by step helped a lot. I also found it useful to derive a general formula for the nth layer, which not only confirmed my step-by-step calculations but also provided a more elegant way to express the solution. So, yeah, I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times '1+3(' appears. Each '1+3(' starts a new layer. Let's count: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, each layer is one more than three times the previous. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). So, how many layers?

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding each step is manageable. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which can be represented recursively. Let's denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, no, actually, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step expansion and the recursive formula, I arrive at the same result.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula and avoid computing each layer step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. By computing each layer step by step or applying the formula derived from the recurrence, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, we have 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, 4 * 3 = 12: units place is 2, carryover 1. 2 (tens) *3 =6 +1=7: tens place is 7. 5 (hundreds) *3=15: hundreds place is 5, carryover 1. 9 (thousands) *3=27 +1=28: thousands place is 8, carryover 2. 2 (ten thousands) *3=6 +2=8: ten thousands place is 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers, which is a bit tedious. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or something. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p =3*a_p +1. Solving for a_p: a_p -3*a_p=1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct, which is Layer3. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, if I expand all the layers, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to see how that would work. The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))))). If I let x be the innermost expression, then x=1 +3, but that seems too simplistic. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote E as the entire expression, so E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me see how many layers there are. Counting the opening parentheses, there are nine 3(1+... So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, perhaps the entire expression can be written as E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let me denote the innermost part as E1: E1=1+3=4. Then, the next layer out is E2=1+3*E1=1+12=13. Then, E3=1+3*E2=1+39=40. E4=1+3*E3=1+120=121. E5=1+3*E4=1+363=364. E6=1+3*E5=1+1092=1093. E7=1+3*E6=1+3279=3280. E8=1+3*E7=1+9840=9841. E9=1+3*E8=1+29523=29524. Finally, E=3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, using the formula I derived, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, for n=9, we get a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and E=3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive formula or expanding step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the number is 88,572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time we compute 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me list them again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me check each layer's computation again to be thorough. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if each layer follows a certain formula. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression using the closed-form formula directly. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations because sometimes when I do a lot of layers, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems valid. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 is indeed 29524. Then, 29524 *3: Let me compute that again. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yep, correct. So, I think I've got it right. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again. Let's write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x       3\n   -----------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that seems a bit off.

Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check 29524 * 3.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 =60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time it's 1+3(...), and I count the number of opening parentheses after each '3('.\n\nLet me count the number of '3('s:\n\nStarting from the outermost: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '3(' is followed by a '1+3(...)'.\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another '1+3(...)'. Let me count the number of times '1+3(' occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of layers. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after each '3(', there's a '1+3(...)', so the number of layers is equal to the number of '3('s, which is 9, because from the outermost to innermost, each '3(' introduces a new layer. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 as innermost, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, in my earlier computation, Layer 9 was the outermost expression, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I had 9 layers, that would mean that the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers. Let me count the number of '3(' in the expression:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '3(' is followed by a '1+3(...)', so let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me look again. The expression starts with 3(1+3(...), so the first '3(' is at the very beginning. Then inside that, there's another '3(', and so on. Let me count the number of '3(' from the outermost to innermost:\n\n- The outermost is 3(1+3(...), so that's the first '3('.\n\n- Inside that, the next '3(' is the second layer.\n\n- Continuing, each '3(' adds a new layer.\n\nSo, how many '3('s are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3, so the last '3(' would be followed by 1+3, which is 1+3 without another '3('. So, perhaps there are 8 layers? Wait, no, because the innermost is 1+3, so each '3(' introduces a new layer, but the innermost is just 1+3, so perhaps the number of layers is 8? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it with each layer:\n\nLayer 9: 3(1+3(...))\n\nLayer 8: 3(1+3(...))\n\n...\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many times '1+3(' appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another '1+3(...)'.\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1).\n\nLayer 3 is 1+3*(Layer 2).\n\nContinuing until Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but when I count the number of '1+3(' in the expression, I see that after the initial 3(, there are 8 more '1+3('s, making a total of 9 layers, including the innermost. So, perhaps I was correct with 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3(, there's a 1+3(...), which itself contains another 3(, and so on, until the innermost is 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of '1+3(' occurrences.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '1+3(' is followed by another '1+3(', except the innermost, which is 1+3 without another '('. So, starting from the outermost, each '1+3(' introduces a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, but the innermost is just 1+3, so perhaps the number of layers is 8? Because each '1+3(' after the initial one adds a new layer. Hmm, I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that the expression is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). The innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write down the expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let's count them:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from 4. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the innermost is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, yes, that would mean that the final computation is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nLet me just make sure that each layer is correctly computed:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, the final step is to multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the computations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I've double-checked each layer. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer should be 88572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it directly without computing each layer step by step, which would have saved time, especially if the expression was much longer. But for nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's also a good way to check that the formula works. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, the final answer is 87,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be expressed as a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k = 3 and c = 1. Starting from a_1 = 4, but maybe it's better to index from a_0. Let me adjust that. Let's say a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. Then, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * c, but I think I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, the solution to a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Let me check that with n=1: a_1 = 3^1 * a_0 + c*(3^1 - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*a0 + c*(2)/2 = 3*a0 + c. Which matches our recurrence a1 = 1 + 3*a0, since c=1. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, for our case, a_n = 3^n * a0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2, since c=1 and k=3. Since a0 = 1, then a_n = 3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me simplify that: a_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=3: a3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, no, let's see. The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is a1. Then Layer 2 is a2, and so on up to Layer 9, which would be a9. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 =87,572. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be quicker for larger numbers. But since the problem only had 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, just a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, if I had to compute, say, 20 layers, the formula would be much more efficient. But for this problem, either method works. So, I'm confident that the answer is 87,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{87572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12; total 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. I wonder if there's a formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, using the closed-form formula also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014iterative step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, I think I correctly went through each layer, computing each one step by step. Therefore, the final result should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or look for a pattern or formula that might represent this kind of nested expression.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go back through each layer to check.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in the original problem, the expression has 9 layers, so layer 9 is the outermost one. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for the nth term. Let me try to model this. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Comparing this to L_n = A*3^{n} + B, we get: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L1 = 4: L1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(L9), and L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result for this expression.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one.

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, layer n=9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to approach it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. It's always good to verify the result using a different method to ensure it's correct. So, both methods give me 88572, so I can be confident that's the right answer. I think I've got it. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a general formula for the nth layer. Either way, the answer is the same. It's a bit time-consuming to compute each layer, but with patience, it works out. Alternatively, using the formula is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But for just nine layers, both methods are manageable. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is more than 80,000. Let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, I thought it was 88572. Let me confirm that.

Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined recursively. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if we can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a faster way to compute this without expanding each layer, especially since the number of layers is nine, which is quite a few. But since I already did the step-by-step computation and confirmed it with the formula, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7.

Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, all the steps check out. I think that's the correct answer. I was a bit nervous when I saw all those layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. It's like peeling an onion; each layer reveals the next one, and eventually, you get to the core. So, yeah, 88572 should be the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This kind of recurrence can be solved using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say B, because the nonhomogeneous term is a constant. Plugging B into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840.

Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be 88572. Wait, maybe I messed up the digits. Let me check with another method. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding these together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\nAh, yes, so 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, my initial step-by-step multiplication was wrong because I miscounted the digits. The correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 87572. Wait, but according to the breakdown, it's 88572. So, I must have miscounted the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, when I multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\nTens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\nHundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\nThousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\nTen thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 88572. That's correct. So, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong because I didn't account for the carryover correctly at the thousands place. It should be 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, so write 8 and carry 2 to the ten thousands place. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I thought I had 29524 \u00d7 3 = 87572, but that's incorrect. The correct value is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\n3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for this case, since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the expression can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding this, for example:\n\na_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40.\n\nWait, but that's getting more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can express a_n in terms of powers of 3.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4 = 3 + 1.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{homog} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{part} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K \u2192 0 = 1 + 2K \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThen, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer, used the recurrence relation, and even derived a formula to compute it directly. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value and multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my multiplication again because 3 * 29524 should be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back and verify each layer's computation to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdd them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,7,7,5,2. Wait, that would be 87752? Wait, no, let me check the order.\n\nWait, the number is 29524, which is:\n\n2 (ten thousands place)\n\n9 (thousands)\n\n5 (hundreds)\n\n2 (tens)\n\n4 (units)\n\nSo when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 (tens place)*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5 (hundreds place)*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9 (thousands place)*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands place)*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo writing the result from the highest place to the lowest: 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 should be 88572, but let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 *3 = 88572. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was writing down the digits, I thought I had 87752, which was wrong. So that was a mistake in the digit-wise multiplication. So the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers again because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so I think that's the right answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, another approach: this expression is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nLooking at the expression: Each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in the problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, verifying each computation, and then using a general formula for the nth term, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Compute Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Compute Layer 2:**\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. **Compute Layer 3:**\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. **Compute Layer 4:**\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. **Compute Layer 5:**\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. **Compute Layer 6:**\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. **Compute Layer 7:**\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. **Compute Layer 8:**\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. **Compute Layer 9:**\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n    - Final result: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, putting it all together, we have 87572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, the result is 87572. Let me verify this multiplication with another method to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add digit by digit: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. 2 + 0 = 2. So, we get 89052? Wait, that doesn't match the earlier result. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again. Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Wait, 29524 + 29524 is 59048, correct. Then adding another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Tens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. Hundreds: 0 + 5 = 5. Thousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. Ten-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. Hundred-thousands: 0 + 0 = 0. So, the result is 88572? Wait, that's different from both previous results. I'm getting confused now. Maybe I should use another approach. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down: 29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's 88572. Hmm, so earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572, but when I added the numbers, I got 88572. Clearly, I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check that again. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it down: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that's 87572, but when I broke it down, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. I must have miscounted the digits. Let me write down the digits properly. The number is 29524. Let's write each digit with its place:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, no carry.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88572. So, I must have miscounted earlier when I thought the thousands place was 7. Actually, it's 8. So, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake there. Let me check Layer 9 again.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. That seems correct.\n\nThen, Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841.\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*800 = 2400\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n3*1 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.

Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Maybe there's a formula I could use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern and just computed each layer step by step, I would still arrive at the same answer, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1) Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...). Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...), each subsequent 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another 1+3(...), which is the second layer.\n3. Then another, third layer.\n4. Fourth.\n5. Fifth.\n6. Sixth.\n7. Seventh.\n8. Eighth.\n9. Ninth.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each time we go out, it's another layer, so up to Layer 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that was correct because there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me check my calculations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute it step by step again, perhaps using another method or verifying with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that this structure is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined by the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solving the homogeneous equation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, finding a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I still arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). This is a finite geometric series, but since it's nested, it's more of a linear recurrence as I did before. But using the formula I derived, it's straightforward.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute a few layers manually using the formula. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) follows the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Wait, but let me check if I have nine layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me parse the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach set of parentheses adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(... \n\nWait, no, the first one is 3(1 + 3(... So, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(... So, actually, the number of layers is 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Wait, this looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, the step-by-step process is to recognize the nested structure, compute each layer starting from the inside, and then use the recurrence relation or the closed-form formula to find the result efficiently. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step as I did initially also works, though it's more time-consuming but perhaps more straightforward for someone not familiar with recurrence relations.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final computation of the outermost layer and then multiplying by 3. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to use a formula, confirming the result efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next nested term})\\). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"
