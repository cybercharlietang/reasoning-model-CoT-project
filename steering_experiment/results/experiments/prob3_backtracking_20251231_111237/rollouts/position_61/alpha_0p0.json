Wait, that's not the right way because 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 +5*100 +2*10 +4. So, 2*10000=20000, 9*1000=9000, 5*100=500, 2*10=20, 4*1=4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That's another way to check. 29524 is 30000 minus 476. So, 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 476 * 3 = 1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think about solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my previous computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer multiplies this value by 3 and adds 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value before the final multiplication is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Adding 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then + 9000 = 88048, + 500 = 88548, + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate anywhere. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step. Alternatively, I can note that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have computed it using the formula from the start. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step was feasible. I think I've double-checked my work, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524.

Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again, but this time, perhaps using a different approach, like expanding the expression algebraically. Let me try that. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9 = 1 + 3*L8. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, let's compute each L:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value at each layer. So, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, etc. It looks like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * C + d, where d is a particular solution. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. Let me find the particular solution. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since b is a constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n = 1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually using the formula. Let's compute L4 using the formula: L4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is what I had before. So, yes, the formula works.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time if I have to do similar problems in the future. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I can compute this without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, both methods work. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I think I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then each a_n can be computed recursively. But since I already computed each layer manually, and the numbers seem to be growing exponentially, I think my step-by-step approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. The expression is a nested multiplication, so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of a variable. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) But this seems recursive. Alternatively, if I consider each layer as a term in a sequence, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula. Let's see: Let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous computation.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this recursion as a geometric series. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find C. The steady-state solution is when a_n = a_{n-1} = C.\n\nSo, C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So, yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make any mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 Correct. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The base case is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, actually, no, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so expanding the entire expression might lead to a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Alternatively, if I let x be the innermost expression, then each layer is 1 + 3x, and the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x), and so on. But since there are nine layers, it's a bit involved. However, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and since we have nine layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, so E=3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, let me try to expand the expression step by step without using the formula to see if I get the same result. Let's write out each step:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nEach step seems correct, so I think the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, everything checks out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write a small program or use a calculator to compute each step, it would likely confirm the same result. But since I've already done it manually and cross-verified using the recursive formula, I don't think there's a need for further computation.\n\nIn summary, by methodically working from the innermost parentheses outward and computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. Additionally, using the derived formula for the nth layer confirmed the result, which gives me confidence in the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems consistent. But let me check one more time to be sure. Let me compute Layer 1 through Layer 9 again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Yes, that's the same as before. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without going through each layer, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just for fun, maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier results: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, we arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression involving multiple layers of parentheses.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could compute this without manually calculating each layer. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer.\n\nSince Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, because n=9, so L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nThat's another way to compute it, and it gives the same result. So, that confirms the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each time we're adding another layer of 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to building a number in base 3 or something, but the recurrence approach seems solid.\n\nIn summary, by either computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer and \\( L_9 \\) is the outermost layer.\n\n1.

The entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer \\( L_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nWe can also verify this using the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with the closed-form solution \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).

Hmm, that seems correct, but I feel like such a large number. Let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Because computing each layer one by one is time-consuming and prone to error, especially with so many layers. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the sequence is a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3*K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n = 1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, which is the 9th term. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer manually. That was a good exercise; I almost didn't realize there was a pattern until I thought about the recurrence relation. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving the recurrence, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do this step by step, I might make a mistake. Let me verify each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers. This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, let's see: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, and so on. This seems to match the layers I computed earlier. So, the nth term is defined recursively. I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. For a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the innermost layer is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. So, this method using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution is much more efficient and less error-prone. It also confirms that our initial step-by-step calculation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

    "text": " Write down 7, no carry. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1. 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, carry over 1. 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So, 59048. Now, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 + 1 = 7, write 7. 0 + 5 = 5, write 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 + 1 = 8, write 8. So, total is 88572. Okay, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster or reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9. So, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to express the entire original expression in terms of 3^{10} or something similar, but I think the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation both lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence, we derive a closed-form formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yep, same result. So, 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is being multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem using the formula for a geometric series. The expression is essentially 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. If I let x be the innermost expression, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3x. But since each layer is built upon the previous one, it's more of a recursive structure. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, computing a_9 gives me 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous computation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define the layers more formally. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly, saving time.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the problem only has nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step. If there were more layers, perhaps a recursive formula or a geometric series approach could be more efficient. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, as before.

Therefore, I think the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer equals 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term).

But just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recursive relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the homogeneous solution, if we consider the recurrence L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure it's consistent. For example, Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I can be confident that Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do this carefully. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an off-by-one error or miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each time I see a closing parenthesis, that's the end of a layer. Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1+3(...) before the outermost 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3(, each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first layer is (1+3(...)), then each time we have another (, so counting from the innermost, how many times do we have (1+3 before we reach the end? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me see: Each time we have a new layer, it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3). Then, the next layer is layer 2: (1+3(layer1)). Up to layer 9: (1+3(layer8)). So, there are 9 layers, each starting with 1+3, and each time wrapping around the previous layer. So, my initial approach was correct, computing each layer from 1 to 9, each time using the result from the previous layer. So, I think my calculations are correct, and the final result is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing the layers again, perhaps using a different method, like recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nWait a minute, this expression seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it again using the formula. Since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term in this sequence. Let's define a sequence where a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 for n \u2265 2. So, a\u2081 = 4, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form of a linear recurrence is a\u2099 = c*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a\u2099 = A*c\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me apply this. First, find the homogeneous solution: a\u2099^(h) = A*3\u207f. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a\u2081 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3\u00b9 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, a\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a\u2081 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a\u2082 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a\u2083 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a\u2089, we have a\u2089 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm it's 59049. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each until reaching the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recursive formula, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that seems different from the previous result.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm this with another approach to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for it, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me also check if I can see a pattern in the layers. Looking at the values: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Hmm, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Let me see if these numbers correspond to a known sequence or if there's a formula for them. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let me solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Calculating each layer step by step gives me the value at each layer, and finally, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation, I found a closed-form formula, which also gave me the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, the nth layer is found to be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 would be more than 80,000, but 29524 is about 30,000, so 30,000 * 3 is 90,000. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me try again. Let me write 29524 as 2 9 5 2 4. Multiplying each digit by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me verify the layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a new layer. Let me count: The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" occurrences. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3(...), that's the first occurrence.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" appear? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(...Layer 1...)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(...Layer 2...)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(...Layer 8...)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 9 layers inside, each adding another 1 + 3*(previous). So, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting with the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and used in the next. After computing up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me verify each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the general form is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would correspond to n=9. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. Starting from the innermost term, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, expanding the entire expression might result in a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Since there are nine layers, each time we have an additional 3 multiplied. So, expanding E, we can write E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me try to expand this expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: The innermost part is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. As we saw earlier, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when expanded, each layer adds another term in the form of 3^k. Let me see if I can express E in terms of a sum. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), the entire expression, when fully expanded, would be a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see how that works.\n\nLet me consider the innermost term first. The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and adds 1. So, for Layer 1: 4 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Alternatively, 13 can be written as 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check:\n\n1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Alternatively, using the sum: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Because 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 4: 121. Let's see: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Because 1 + 3=4, +9=13, +27=40, +81=121. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer n corresponds to the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression E is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about expanding E entirely, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand all the parentheses, it's equivalent to 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). Wait, because each layer adds another exponent. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nContinuing this way, each layer adds another power of 3, up to 3^8. So, the outermost layer (Layer 9) would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. Therefore, E = 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8). The sum inside the parentheses is a geometric series with 9 terms, first term 1, ratio 3. The sum S = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier, Layer 9 was 29524, which is 3*9841. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, no. Let me clarify. If Layer 9 is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, then the sum S = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. So, E = 3*S = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but earlier, we had Layer 9 as 29524, which was 1 + 3*9841. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer8, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, E = 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...+3*(1 + 3)...))), with 9 layers, each adding a 3^k term, then E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ) = 3*(9841) = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier result of 88572. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of layers or the exponents.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the outermost layer is Layer 9 or whether the innermost is Layer 1. Let me try to reconcile this.\n\nIn the initial approach, we had 9 layers, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nIn the geometric series approach, if we consider E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ) = 3*(9841) = 29523, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of terms. Let me see: Each time we have a layer, it's equivalent to adding another term in the geometric series. So, with 9 layers, starting from 1 + 3, we would have terms up to 3^8, as each layer adds a higher power. So, the sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^8 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But that's different from the 88572 we got earlier.\n\nWait, this suggests a discrepancy. Let me check where I might have gone wrong.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, starting from Layer1 = 4, Layer2 = 13, Layer3=40,..., Layer9=29524. Then, E = 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nIn the geometric series approach, E is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841=29523.\n\nSo, which one is correct? Let me compute both and see.\n\nWait, let's compute Layer9 using the geometric series approach. If Layer9 = sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. But earlier, we computed Layer9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that suggests that Layer9 is 1 + 3*sum_{k=0}^8 3^k = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in the initial expansion, E = 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that E is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841=29523. But that seems inconsistent with the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is about how many layers there are. Let me recount the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, and each layer has a closing parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+\" after the first 3 adds a layer. Let's count the number of \"1+\" terms:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 \"1+\" terms, each nested inside the previous. So, that would correspond to 9 layers. Therefore, Layer1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer9 is the outermost 1+3*(...).\n\nSo, Layer9 = 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*Layer7) = ... = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)).\n\nTherefore, Layer9 is equal to sum_{k=0}^8 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*Layer9 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier, using the step-by-step approach, Layer9 was 29524, which was 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, and E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis discrepancy is confusing. Let me check both approaches carefully.\n\nFirst, in the step-by-step approach, starting from Layer1=4, each subsequent Layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, Layer4=121, Layer5=364, Layer6=1093, Layer7=3280, Layer8=9841, Layer9=29524. Then, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nIn the geometric series approach, considering that Layer9 is the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Then, E=3*9841=29523.\n\nSo, which is correct? Let me compute Layer9 step-by-step:\n\nLayer1=1+3=4.\n\nLayer2=1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer3=1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4=1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5=1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer6=1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7=1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8=1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9=1+3*9841=29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer9=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in the geometric series approach, I thought Layer9 was the sum up to 3^8, which is 9841, but that seems to be Layer8 in the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the geometric series approach is missing a layer. Let me see:\n\nIf Layer1=4=3^0 + 3^1=1+3=4.\n\nLayer2=13=1 + 3*(4)=1 + 3 + 9=13=3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer3=40=1 + 3*(13)=1 + 3 + 9 + 27=40=3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSimilarly, Layer9 would be sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^8= (3^9 -1)/2=9841.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, Layer9=29524=1 + 3*Layer8=1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nSo, the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is 9841, which is Layer8 in the step-by-step approach. Therefore, Layer9=1 + 3*Layer8=1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nTherefore, E=3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the geometric series approach was considering Layer9 as the sum up to 3^8, but in reality, that's Layer8. Therefore, the correct sum for Layer9 is 1 + 3*sum_{k=0}^8 3^k = 1 + 3*(9841)=29524.\n\nTherefore, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the confusion was about how the layers correspond to the geometric series. Each Layer n corresponds to the sum up to 3^{n-1}. Therefore, Layer9 corresponds to sum_{k=0}^8 3^k + 1, but actually, each Layer n is 1 + 3*sum_{k=0}^{n-2} 3^k, which may complicate things. Alternatively, it's clearer to stick with the step-by-step approach, which gave us E=88572.\n\nAlternatively, let's model this as a geometric series where each layer adds another power of 3. Let me think differently: Each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's equivalent to 1 + 3*previous_sum. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3^k term.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let me denote S as the entire expression inside the first 3*(...), so S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Since there are 9 layers, S can be expressed as S = 1 + 3*S1, where S1 is the next layer. But this seems recursive and might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous sum), which can be represented as S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4.\n\nAs we did earlier, the solution to this recurrence is S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms the result from the step-by-step approach. So, despite the initial confusion with the geometric series, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's equivalent to a geometric series. So, expanding the entire expression:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf we expand all the parentheses, it would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nBut this seems too nested to expand directly. Instead, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows us to compute it more efficiently.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully working through the problem step by step and verifying with different methods, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1)*(r)^{n-1}, but wait, that's only if r \u2260 1. Wait, let me check that formula. Actually, the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*r^n, and a particular solution is a constant, so let me set a particular solution as a constant K. So, K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the recurrence relation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence formula\u2014give the same result.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute this using the formula directly. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for any errors.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where n goes from 1 to 9. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this seems familiar. I recall that such recurrence relations can sometimes be solved using geometric series or other methods. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, which might have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step wasn't too bad. Just to make sure, let me check my calculations once more. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. 29524 * 3: As I did before, it's 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we compute the ninth layer as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. Then subtract (30000 - 29524) * 3. 30000 - 29524 = 476. So, 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier result.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1: 4.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Now, plug n=2 into the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have the system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, maybe expanding the entire expression would result in a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote E as the entire expression. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me compute E step by step, expanding each layer: Let me start from the innermost parentheses: Let me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is computed as follows:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since I found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.
