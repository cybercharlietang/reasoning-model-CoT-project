    "text": " Wait, but 29524 is written as 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying, it's 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. Let me write it out:\n\n     29524\n   x      3\n   --------\n     88572\n\nWait, let me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (units place):\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27. Add the carried 1: 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 2: 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I computed each layer correctly. I might have made a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. It's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I was able to compute it step by step and also using the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute the final multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7.\n\n5 * 3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 =27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nYes, everything checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation formula, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " No carryover. Next: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, each Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1), with L1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a general formula for Lk. The recurrence is Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1), with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Lk - 3*L(k-1) = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Lk - 3*L(k-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Lh = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Lp = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Lk = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when k=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula with k=1: L1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Lk = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the innermost layer (Layer 9) evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the two expressions: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Let's compute L_1 using the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524 =88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the recursive pattern and solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Using this formula, we compute the value step by step, leading to the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's define L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have directly computed L_9 and then multiplied by 3. That might have saved some time, especially if the number of layers was larger. But for nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable. I think I've double-checked enough to be confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way out. After computing all layers, we multiply the outermost result by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a derived formula, we confirm that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, writing it all together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So that's 88,572. Wait, let me confirm: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, 9 + 9 = 18, 2 + 2 = 4. So that's 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524.

Wait, maybe I should add step by step. 59048 + 29524: Starting from the right: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 0 + 5 = 5, write 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.

    "text": " No carryover. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). 3. Compute each layer step by step up to the 9th layer, which gives 29524. 4. Multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer, which is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me verify each layer's computation again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so each step checks out. I think I did this correctly. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the numbers get big pretty quickly. I remember that expressions like this, with repeated multiplication and addition, can sometimes be represented using geometric series or other formulas, but in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. If it were more layers, I might look for a pattern or a formula to compute it more efficiently, but for nine layers, step-by-step is manageable. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe recognizing it as a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Yeah, that's the same as what I did before. So, whether I think of it as layers or as a recursive sequence, the result is the same. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with repeated multiplication and addition.

So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the expression, I thought it was 9 layers, but when I labeled them, I only had 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of times I added a layer. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, starting from Layer 1, each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, if the innermost is Layer 1, and each time we go out, we add a layer, so the outermost Layer 9 would be the one that's multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses, right? So, that would mean that after computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3 times that is 88,572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( starts a new layer. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each ( after the first one is a new layer. Let's see: The first ( is Layer 1: 1+3(...). Then, inside that, another ( is Layer 2: 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3: There are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so that would mean 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation of 3*29524 again. Maybe I should compute it more carefully.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29,524\nx     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Plus the carryover 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Plus carryover 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Plus carryover 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's break down 29,524 into parts:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3 * 20,000 = 60,000\n\n3 * 9,000 = 27,000\n\n3 * 500 = 1,500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, add all those together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Maybe I can compute a few layers again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B,\n\nwhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWe can solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4, and the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nThis method using the recurrence relation confirms the result we obtained by step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me see if I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression:\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as T_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, T_2 = 1 + 3*T_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nT_3 = 1 + 3*T_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nI see a pattern here. Each T_n is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nT_1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nT_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nT_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, T_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our case, each T_n is 1 + 3*T_{n-1}, so T_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nIn our case, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWhich is exactly what we derived earlier using the recurrence relation.\n\nSo, for n=9, T_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*T_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nThis further confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding all the parentheses. But that would be tedious, as there are nine layers.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because this seems like a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; so 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.

So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. From the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each step out adds another layer. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Because each time we have a 1 + 3(...), and it's repeated 9 times, including the innermost one. So, that's 9 layers, so Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, my computation of Layer 9 as 29524 is correct, and then 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps using a formula for a geometric series or something, since each layer is a multiple of 3 added to 1. Let me see if that's possible. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let me check what n is. Wait, in this case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Then each layer out is n=2, up to n=9. So, a_9 would be the value of the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the formula works. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). According to the formula, this would be n=3 layers. So, a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Then, 3*a_3 = 3*40=120. Let me compute it step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4=13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Correct. So, the formula works for n=3. Therefore, confident that for n=9, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each layer is a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, I get 88572 as the final answer. I think that's solid.

So, the final result is 88572. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 1+3(1+3) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost expression is 3\u00d7Layer 9. So my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a general formula. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing each layer as I go. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, which might make the computation easier, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. I think that confirms that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer is computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1. So, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step, just to confirm. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about this.\n\nLet's denote each layer as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, the problem is essentially computing 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that confirms it. Using the recurrence relation method, I arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n can be expressed as a sum of 3's raised to powers, but perhaps that's more complicated. The recurrence approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n- There are nine such layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n- By defining a recurrence relation, I found that each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n- For n=9, a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n- Multiplying by 3 gives the final result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step builds upon the previous one, and the formula using the recurrence relation confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first. 29524 + 29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10 (carry 1), 9+9=18 +1=19 (carry 1), 2+2=4 +1=5.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88,572. Yep, that all checks out. I don't think I made any calculation errors here.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on again. Let me check Layer 8 again because when I computed Layer 8, I had 3*3280. Let me confirm 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the final multiplication is 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I've done this correctly. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a geometric progression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), it's a recursive structure. Maybe there's a way to express it as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p.\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers. Let me check if this formula works with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to see it. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again to be sure. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all the steps check out. I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a geometric series. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. In our case, a = 3, b = 1. But wait, our initial term is L_1 = 4. Wait, let's see. Wait, maybe it's better to adjust the indices. Let me see: Let's consider n starting from 1, with L_1 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is correct. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition at n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since our problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula\u2014I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation, we find that the innermost layers compute to 4, then 13, then 40, and so on, up to the outermost layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n3. After computing all nine layers, the outermost parentheses equal 29524.\n4.

So, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.

Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is defined recursively. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, the value is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. This method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But for nine layers, both methods are manageable. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it easier without computing each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me see. The expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula, let me check n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Yep, that's right. So, the formula seems solid.

Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where L(1) = 4, and L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, L(1) = 4, L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to L(9). Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9). So, maybe I can find a general formula for L(n). Let's see. The recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when expanded, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand this, it would be 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3^9. Wait, let me see. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the innermost part as E, so E = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*E. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E) = 1 + 3 + 3*3*E, and so on. If I expand all the layers, I might get a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see how many terms there are. Since there are 9 layers, each contributing a power of 3. So, perhaps the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). Wait, but let's check. Let me think recursively. Each time, the expression inside is 1 + 3*something, which when multiplied by 3, gives 3 + 3^2*something. So, maybe the total sum is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me test this idea. Let me define S as the sum inside: S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to 9 layers. Wait, but in our case, the original expression is 3*S, where S is the expression with 9 layers. But S itself is 1 + 3*(another expression with 8 layers). Hmm, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see. Let me consider that each layer adds another power of 3. So, when I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Each time, the innermost term is 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), etc. So, expanding each layer would add another term. Let me try to see how many terms there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 12. Then, the next is 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 39. Each time, the term being added is 3 times the previous total. So, when I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. So, if I expand all the layers, it would be 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). Wait, how many terms is that? Let me count. From 3^0 up to 3^8, that's 9 terms. So, the sum inside would be Sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's the sum inside, which is Layer 9: 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result of 88572. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here. Wait, no, because when I expanded it, I thought it was 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k), but actually, each layer adds another 3^k term, but I think I might have miscalculated the number of terms. Let me check again. Wait, each time you have a layer, you're adding another 3^k term. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, each layer adds another term. Therefore, after 9 layers, the innermost expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, which is a sum of 9 terms. So, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8 = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*9841 = 29523. But this contradicts my earlier result of 88572. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check my initial step-by-step computation. When I computed each layer step by step, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But according to this geometric series approach, the sum inside is 9841, so 3*9841=29523, which is different. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me check my initial step-by-step computation again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Correct. Layer 2:1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, according to this, the answer is 88572. But according to the geometric series approach, the sum inside is 9841, leading to 3*9841=29523. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step, but more carefully. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost as P1 to P9, where P1 is the innermost.\n\nP1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nP2: 1 + 3*(P1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nP3:1 + 3*(P2)=1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nP4:1 + 3*(P3)=1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nP5:1 +3*(P4)=1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nP6:1 +3*(P5)=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nP7:1 +3*(P6)=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nP8:1 +3*(P7)=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nP9:1 +3*(P8)=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(P9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut in the geometric series approach, I thought that the sum inside is 9841, which would make the total 3*9841=29523. But that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the geometric series approach. Let me see.\n\nIf I model the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))), with 9 layers, then each layer adds another power of 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 +3), etc., each time adding another 3^k term.\n\nSo, if I expand it, it would be 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). That's a sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, so the sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 -1)/(3-1) = 9841, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*9841=29523.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step approach, it's 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the mistake is in the geometric series approach because the expression is not exactly the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k multiplied by 3. Let me check.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which when expanded is 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + 3*3^3 + ... up to 9 terms. So, it's 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). That sum is indeed 3*(sum_{k=0}^8 3^k) = 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step approach, it's 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think I see the mistake. In the step-by-step approach, I computed each layer as 1 + 3*previous_layer, starting from the innermost. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, etc., up to Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the geometric series approach, the sum inside is 9841, leading to 3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but 3*9841=29523, but according to the step-by-step, the total is 88572, which is 3*(29524). So, perhaps the geometric series approach is missing something.\n\nWait, let me check: when I expand 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), it's 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3*3^8, which is 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + ... + 6561. The sum of this series is 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 6561). The sum inside the parentheses is sum_{k=0}^8 3^k = 9841, so 3*9841=29523.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step, it's 88572. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the step-by-step approach is correct, and the geometric series approach is wrong because the layers are not adding up in the way I thought. Let me see: when I expand the expression, it's not 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k), but rather 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) plus some other terms. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), it's equivalent to 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. So, it's 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^9. Wait, but 3^9 is 19683. So, the sum would be sum_{k=1}^9 3^k. The sum of 3^k from k=1 to 9 is (3^10 -3)/(3-1) = (59049 -3)/2=59046/2=29523.\n\nWait, that's the same as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841=29523.\n\nSo, according to this, the total is 29523.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, I got 88572, which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9, each starting with 1+3(...). So, there are 9 layers.\n\nBut when I expanded using the geometric series, I considered the sum from k=0 to 8, which is 9 terms, leading to 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) =29523.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, I ended up with 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the step-by-step approach is correct because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is different from just adding 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me compute the sum from the step-by-step approach.\n\nLayer1:4=1+3=4\n\nLayer2:13=1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:40=1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:121=1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:364=1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1093=1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:3280=1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:9841=1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:29524=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the geometric series approach, the sum inside is 9841, so 3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but 9841 is Layer8, which is one layer before Layer9. So, perhaps the confusion is that the geometric series approach is considering the sum up to Layer8, but the actual expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*(1 +3*Layer8)=3*(1 +3*9841)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the mistake in the geometric series approach was that I considered the sum up to Layer8, but the actual expression includes Layer9, which is 1 +3*Layer8, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the correct approach is the step-by-step one, leading to 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut to confirm, let me compute the entire expression using another method. Let me compute each layer and ensure that Layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution.\n\nWe have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nAs I did earlier, the solution is L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough times. I might have confused the number of layers in the geometric series approach, but the step-by-step and recurrence relation methods both lead to the same answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by expanding each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus three times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by three to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carry over 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands place: 8. So putting it all together: 8,8,7,5,2. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the digits. Let's write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a moment. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n goes from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n \u2265 2. So, each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nEither way, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then recognized a pattern and derived a formula to compute the nth layer, which confirmed my earlier step-by-step result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process continues up to Layer 9, which is 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2.

    "text": " Wait, no, 29524 is written as 2 9 5 2 4, so from right to left: 4, 2, 5, 9, 2. So, 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.

Yes, because 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 29524 is 476 less than 30000, so 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems correct.

Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming if there are many layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. Then, the problem is to compute 3*a_9. Hmm, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me write it as: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the initial terms to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Good, the formula seems to hold. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I wanted to, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, since each layer is essentially multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But in this case, since the expression is finite with nine layers, the recursive approach or the closed-form formula both work well. It's good to see that both methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the recursive pattern and deriving a closed-form formula, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.

So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my earlier steps because that seems like a big number. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This looks like a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can look for a pattern or solve it using the method for linear recurrences. Let's compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern: L1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Hmm, so each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, whose solution is Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have: For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire computation using the formula, I could note that the outermost expression is 3*(L9) =3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So whether I compute it step by step, using the recurrence, or by finding a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

After computing all layers up to L9, we find L9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet me add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, with 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but given that it's only 9 layers, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 through a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me check each multiplication again.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer step by step until we reach the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. That's another way to look at it, using the formula. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of a formula without computing each layer. Let me try that. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) But wait, the inner expression is similar to E itself, except that E starts with 3*(...), whereas the inner part is 1 + 3*(...). Hmm, maybe I can express it as E = 3*(1 + (E)/3). Wait, let me think. If I look at the innermost part, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote the innermost expression as x, then the next layer is 1 + 3x, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x) = 1 + 3 + 9x, and so on. But perhaps this approach is more complicated. Alternatively, since I found a general formula for a_n, and the outermost layer is a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Either way, I arrive at the same answer, which is 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since it's nested, it's more like a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1=4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = 2*3^n + 1? Let me test it. For n=1: 2*3^1 +1=6+1=7\u22604. No. Alternatively, maybe a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. But since I already did it step by step, and both methods agree, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly. Because if I messed up any layer, the final answer will be wrong. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for a_n. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. But the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Therefore, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1.

Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is larger. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. It seems like each term is defined based on the previous term, multiplied by 3 and then adding 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nThen, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula for L_n is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which would be:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nEither way, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer.

That seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer step by step? Maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me consider that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the number of layers is 9, so maybe a_9 is the value we computed as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Thus,\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nTherefore,\n\na_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. Either way, we arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and found a pattern leading to a formula, which confirmed the result. It's always good to check your work, especially with such a lengthy expression, to make sure you didn't make an arithmetic error along the way.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 1: } 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 2: } 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 3: } 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 4: } 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 5: } 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 6: } 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 7: } 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 8: } 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 9: } 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n3.

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me write it correctly. Wait, no, because 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten thousands place is 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.

That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be the case because when I multiplied 3 * 29524, I think I might have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try another approach. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first is 3(1+3(...). Then inside, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, 1+3*(Layer 1) is Layer 2.\n\n1+3*(Layer 2) is Layer 3.\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify the calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1.\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, each layer L_n can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6+1=7, 5*3=15, 2*3=6+1=7, 9*3=27+1=28, 2*3=6+2=8. So writing it down: 88572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all layers seem correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series or something similar, but given that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence a_n where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation. The problem is to compute 3*a_9. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). So, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing that each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which allows us to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. But since the problem only had nine layers, computing each step was manageable. If there were more layers, the closed-form formula would be more efficient. But in this case, both methods led to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct. Therefore, the solution is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
