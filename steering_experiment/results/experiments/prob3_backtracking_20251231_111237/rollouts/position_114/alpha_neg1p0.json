So, that's another way to confirm the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed the pattern earlier and applied the formula, but since I was computing each layer step by step, it worked out fine. Either way, the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me check the computations again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to be sure: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and substitute it into the outer layers. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer follows a pattern described by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form expression and compute the final value. The result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms it.

Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Starting from a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, so it's a geometric sequence with a ratio of 3. The general formula for such a sequence is a_n = a_1 * r^{n-1} + (r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1), but perhaps it's more complicated. Alternatively, using the closed-form I derived earlier, which gives the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result.

Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.
