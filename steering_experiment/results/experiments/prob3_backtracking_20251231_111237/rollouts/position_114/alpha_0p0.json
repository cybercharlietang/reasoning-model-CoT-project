By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524.

Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula: 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form expression. But since the problem is to compute it step by step, the initial method of computing each layer is probably what's expected.

Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. Good. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but the expression is nested, so each term is 1 + 3*(next term). Therefore, the total expression is a sum of 1's and powers of 3. But I think the method I used before is correct. So, to recap, I computed each layer from the inside out, each time taking 1 + 3*(previous layer), and ended up with layer 9 as 29524. Then, multiplied by 3 to get 88572.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just confirm that I applied the formula correctly. Since the problem has 9 layers, does that correspond to n=9? Let me see: The innermost layer is 1+3=4, which is a1. Then each subsequent layer adds one more n. So, the outermost layer is a9, which is multiplied by 3. Yes, so that's correct. So, using the formula, I can compute a9 as (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.

Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.
