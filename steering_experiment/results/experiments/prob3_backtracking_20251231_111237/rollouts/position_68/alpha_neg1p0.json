    "text": " So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I thought 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me confirm that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer's computation step by step, just to be sure. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs. From the innermost to the outermost, I think it's 8 layers because the innermost is just 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, there are nine instances of 1+3(...). Wait, no, because each time it's 1+3(...), so perhaps the number of layers is eight, because each layer is a 1 + 3*(...). Wait, maybe I should write down the layers as per the expression. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems correct. So, I think my computation is correct. Let me just make sure that each layer's computation is accurate. Layer 1: 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000. Wait, let me check again. Wait, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, that makes sense because 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, and 29,524 is slightly less than 30,000, so 88,572 is reasonable. So, the final answer would be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n = 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me retrace each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L(n) represent the value of the nth layer, then L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recursive formula. Let me write that down: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into this form. L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Assuming L(n) = A*3^n + B, then L(n-1) = A*3^(n-1) + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, when n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches L(1)=4. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches L(2)=13. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, matches L(3)=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the closed-form formula, it would be 3*( (3^(10) -1)/2 ). Which simplifies to (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get there without computing each layer. But since the problem didn't specify a particular method, either approach is fine. I think I've got it now.

    "text": " So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier when computing Layer 9. Let me double-check the layers because 3*(Layer 8) being 29524 seems high. Let me go back step by step.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I remember that sometimes when dealing with these nested expressions, there's a formula or a pattern that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving recurrence relations. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this using the formula as well. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3 * L_9.\n\nSo, 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049; 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nTherefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this makes sense. By using the recurrence relation and finding a general formula, I was able to confirm that each layer computes correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives the correct result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, we find the value of each layer. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **General Formula**: Each layer follows the recurrence relation L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For Layer 9 (n=9), L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Computation**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me confirm this result. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This looks like a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of the values. 3. After computing the innermost layers, move outward until reaching the outermost layer. 4. Multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression. 5. To verify, I derived a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation and confirmed that the value of the outermost layer was correct. 6. Finally, multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. This methodical approach helped me avoid mistakes and ensured that each step was correct before moving on to the next. It's a good strategy when dealing with nested expressions or recursive sequences.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait a minute, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term seems to be following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check: L2 = 3*L1 + 1 = 3*4 +1=13. Correct. L3 = 3*L2 +1=3*13+1=40. Correct. So, in general, Ln = 3*Ln-1 +1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3B +1 => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, using the formula confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, since each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, we can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if I can express the sum in another way. Let's denote S as the sum we're trying to compute, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). But maybe it's more complicated than that. Alternatively, since each term is of the form 1 + 3*next_term, and we have 9 such terms, it's a nested expression that can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) nine times. But perhaps using the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is more straightforward, as I did earlier. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that seems like a lot of computation. Let's go through each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize so that I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p \u2192 L_p - 3*L_p = 1 \u2192 -2*L_p = 1 \u2192 L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the original expression has 9 layers, n=9. So Layer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 3 multiplied by (1 + ...).

Then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ... )))). It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check if that formula works for the first few terms. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=2/2=1. Wait, but a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe my indexing is off. Let me try n=2: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. That's correct for a_1=4. So, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2? Let's test that. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula seems to hold: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), or something like that. Wait, let me check. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*k^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = k*B + c => B - k*B = c => B*(1 - k) = c => B = c/(1 - k). So, the general solution is a_n = A*k^n + c/(1 - k). Applying initial conditions: At n=0, a_0 = 1 (since the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which would correspond to n=1, but maybe I need to adjust the indices). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see: Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, left side: C*3^n + D. Right side: C*3^n + 3D + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to confirm it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe this sequence is following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me see: Starting from L1 = 4. Then, L2 = 3*L1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. L3 = 3*L2 + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40. L4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121. L5 = 3*121 + 1 = 364. L6 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093. L7 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280. L8 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841. L9 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524. So, that's consistent. So, in general, each layer L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me think about solving this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n = 1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, L9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Since the expression is 3*(L9), and L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2 = 88572. So, same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula for the nth layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives L9 = 29524. Multiplying by the outermost factor of 3, the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Hmm, that seems pretty large, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, it's exponential growth.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a recursive sequence can be found using the method for linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by expanding the expression step by step without using the formula. Let's try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 =4. Then, moving out: 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, finally, 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result.

So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524: 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in computation. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, it seems my calculations are correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding each step is manageable. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula also gives the same result, which confirms that 88572 is the correct answer. I think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation approach, and both lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Solving this relation confirms the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me verify this because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a series of nested expressions where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a base case a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, for example: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 And so on, up to a_9, which we computed as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the entire expression in terms of a single formula. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... ))) Which, as we saw, is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it. Thus, the final answer is 88572. Just to be thorough, let me check my calculations again.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

    "text": " So, putting it all together: 87572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 0 = 1 + 2A \u21d2 A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think I've thought this through thoroughly. I started by computing each layer step by step, then realized there's a pattern and derived a formula to compute the nth layer directly. Both methods led me to the same final answer, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The standard form for such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^{n} + d, where A is a constant determined by the initial condition, and d is a particular solution. Let me find the particular solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant d. Substituting into the recurrence: d = 1 + 3*d \u2192 d - 3*d = 1 \u2192 -2d = 1 \u2192 d = -1/2. Hmm, but that seems a bit messy, especially since our initial conditions are integers. Maybe there's another approach. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation by iteration. Let's compute a few terms to see if a pattern emerges: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's try to express a_n in terms of a_1. Let's write out the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nI can see that each a_n can be expressed as a sum of 3^{n} plus some constants. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + d\n\nWe found earlier that d = -1/2, but let's verify that.\n\nUsing the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + d\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + d = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + d)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*d\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3d\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + d = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3d\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nd = 1 + 3d\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-2d = 1 \u2192 d = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values:\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 Correct\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524.

Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, after double-checking each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is built upon the previous one.\n\nLet me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C = 1 + 3C \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution also leads to the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression might have been a quicker way, but since the problem is finite with nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. However, having a formula is useful for larger numbers of layers.\n\nIn summary, by carefully computing each layer from the inside out and verifying with a closed-form solution, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the final result by 3 to get the answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step: Multiply by 3:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer once more: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with so many layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical approach or a formula for such nested expressions. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then the total expression is 3*L_9. Now, this recurrence relation can be expressed as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me recall that for such a recurrence relation, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by L_n = C*a^n + (b)/(a - 1), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Now, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get the answer using the closed-form formula, which is faster and less error-prone, especially when dealing with many layers. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation instead of computing each layer manually. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write down the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which matches what I had earlier. So, to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can use the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous part is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation can simplify the problem instead of computing each layer manually, especially if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad, although it was a bit time-consuming and required careful attention to avoid arithmetic errors.

But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the intermediate steps.

So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time. Let me explore that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Wait, actually, this is a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.

    "text": " So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each step was: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29524 *3. As before, that's 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a geometric progression or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1+3*13=40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A =4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Wait, because 3*(3^{10})=3^{11}, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.

So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nAll these steps check out. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original problem is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. However, for completeness, let's see if we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I double-checked each step, used a different method (the recurrence relation) to confirm the result, and both methods led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence confirms that the final value after nine layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtract D from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2D. So, 2D = -1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution or at least compute it step by step as I did. Let me see if there's a pattern in the numbers I got:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2? Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 to 13. 3*4=12, 12 +1=13. Wait, no, it's 1 + 3*previous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each term can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2, but let me check for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2= (3-1)/2=1. But Layer 1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Maybe another formula. Alternatively, perhaps each term is 3^{n} +1. Let me see:\n\nLayer 1: 4=3+1=4. n=1: 3^1 +1=4. Correct.\nLayer 2: 13. 3^2 + something? 3^2=9, 9+4=13. Hmm, 4 is 3^1 +1. Maybe not.\n\nWait, let me think about the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve it as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step, and the formula gives the same result, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.

Thus, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^11 again to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct. So, 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Perfect.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've covered all the steps, checked each layer, used a formula approach, and verified the calculations. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we derive that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives us 29524. Multiplying by 3, the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_i. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_i = C*3^i + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find D. When i approaches infinity, the term C*3^i would dominate unless C is zero, but since each a_i is finite, perhaps C is zero? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is the solution to a_i = 3*a_{i-1}, which is a_i = C*3^i. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_i = K. Substituting into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_i = C*3^i - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when i=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer i, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with our earlier computations. For i=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For i=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For i=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_i = (3^{i+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify one more layer using the formula. Let's take layer 5: a_5 should be (3^6 -1)/2. 3^6 is 729. So, (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364, which matches our earlier computation. Good. So, all layers check out with the formula. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form solution. The final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524, which we computed as 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but just to be absolutely sure, let me add another check. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, which could be error-prone. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. That seems to be a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, as a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, expanding the entire expression might lead to a geometric series.\n\nLet me try expanding the innermost layers first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as we've computed before, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and since we have nine layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time we add a layer, we're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(...), which can be thought of as 1 + 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to a certain number of terms. But in this case, each layer adds another term, but each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to expand the entire expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nBut that's the same as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try expanding each layer step by step, but perhaps writing it as a sum.\n\nWait, but since each layer is 1 + 3*next layer, and each next layer is similar, maybe I can express the entire thing as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try.\n\nStarting from the innermost term: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, S = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see:\n\nAfter computing each layer, the result is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding S:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand each parenthesis:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nThen, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nThen, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, S = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I write out all the terms, perhaps I can see a pattern.\n\nWait, let's consider that each time we have 1 + 3*(...), and each ... is similar. So, if we denote the innermost part as x, then the next layer is 1 + 3x, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x), and so on.\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, let me think about the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, if I expand the entire expression, how many terms would there be? Each layer adds another term, so with nine layers, maybe there are nine terms of 3^k? Let me check.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), so each layer adds a 1 and multiplies the rest by 3. So, expanding all the way, the expression would be 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to a certain point. But I'm not sure exactly how many terms there are. Let me try.\n\nWait, let me take a smaller example to see the pattern. Suppose we have only two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute that:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, expanding it:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, expanding all the terms:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, if I expand without substituting, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*1 + 3*3) = 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 3*(13) = 39\n\nWait, that seems to give a sum of 1 + 3 + 9, multiplied by 3. But that's 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, but that's only for two layers. Let me check with three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, but expanding all terms:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1 + 3*3)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, if I expand all the way, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1 + 3*3)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider each layer adding another power of 3, perhaps the total sum is 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^k), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the two-layer example, we had 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 is 13, which is (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches our earlier formula.\n\nSimilarly, in the three-layer example, the sum inside would be 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, but wait, no, because in the three-layer case, the outermost expression was 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) which expanded to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is exactly what we have inside. So, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40.\n\nSo, in general, for n layers, the sum inside would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and then the entire expression would be 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, in the two-layer example, n=2, so (3^{3} -1)/2=26/2=13, then 3*13=39, which matches.\n\nIn the three-layer example, n=3, (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40, then 3*40=120.\n\nIn our original problem, n=9 layers, so the inner sum would be (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what we did earlier.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, yes, 3^10=59049, then (59049 -1)=59048, divided by 2 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\).
